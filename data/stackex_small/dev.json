I also have percentages of orders, net value, and quantity. For example: In the line one (Mat Y and Cust A) the Qty% is 76.9%. This means that 76.9% of the total quantity of material Y was ordered by customer A. So if you sum the Qty % of Mat Y-Cust A and Mat Y - Cust C and Mat Y - Cust B for month 1 it will add up to a 100%. The same has been done for the other percentages as well. I was looking for a good way to visualize this data (That could run into millions of records even for one month) and also to statistically analyse it to draw any conclusions. Any ideas for an exploratory visual and statistical analysis?Here are some questions I am thinking about?:Are there customers who make up a large portion of the sales of particular items? Are there specific Mat-Cust combos that can be considered Critical based on demand hits or net value?

I don't believe I have done anything abusive other than using the Go Daddy default page for almost a year because my site was not ready.2) Should I just launch my site, put a few backlinks to my site, and hope that Google indexes my site again?3) Should I submit my site to Google at Google submit your contentI assume getting Google to reconsider my site is the last option if none of the above works.

I've zeroed down on CxxTest, but as it turns out we can use other Mocking Frameworks (like googlemock) in conjunction with CxxTest too.After reading tutorials on CxxTest (Mocking) and googlemock (the infamous turtle example), I have the general idea that you have to define a mock class (using macros etc), declare an object of the mock class and then pass it to the function you are unit testing. Now, there are many occurences in the existing code base where it isn't possible to do that.Here's an pseudo example to clarify:class CCandidateForTest{    public:    bool foo(int a)    {        CAnotherClass obj;        int b = obj.bar(a+2);        if (a == b) {            return true;        } else {            return false;        }    }}(This is over-simplified, there are also exceptions and the primitive types may also be other objects etc.; but you get the general idea) (also, creation of objects is not always direct and may sometimes use a factory)I want to write a test for the function CCandidateForTest::foo. This method internally creates an object of CAnotherClass, which I need to mock so that CAnotherClass::bar returns different values so that different code paths in foo are traversed in unit testing.In a nutshell, the problem is that the function being tested internally creates an object of the class that needs to be mocked - hence passing an instance of the mocked object to the function is not possible.How do I use mocking in such a case? Is there a specific mocking framework that makes this possible?",

On paper, JPA should serve as an abstraction layer, but If we start to use Database specific data types, views, functions/stored procedures we quickly lose the ability to change. Generally what is the best practice? Use only JPA even if It means performance loss or dive hard into database programming with plSQL or T-SQL and if platform change is needed, rewrites of those functions needs to happen.Another problem is the data types.

This is an old machine - it only has a CD reader, it will not boot off USB and it doesn't like microWatt (which still fits on a CD).  There is something wrong with the microWatt drivers - the entire screen appears as a 0.25 bar.  Anyway, it has WattOS 7.5.My login screen is very reddish.  If I run it from my desktop it is greenish - which is the correct colour.  Also, for some reason, the system thinks it has a 1024x768 screen.  After logging in, all the colours are OK.The obvious answer would have been to ask the WattOS site but it is a chicken and egg situation.  It wants me to sign in and in order to sign in, I need an invite key.  I've got no idea what one of those is.  To find out, I'd have to login and ask but I can't login because I haven't got an invite key.Before committing the settings in stone, I decided to try them out.  First, I set the screen sizexrandr -s 800x600The screen size changes and I can now see the taskbar but the brightness has also changed to half.  When I type xrandr -q, I getxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output defaultFollowed by the resolutionsI suspect it is assuming I have 24 or 32-bit colour but this is an old system so at most 16-bit colour, which possibly explains why it has all gone dim and why my login screen seems to have lost its blue/green component.The questionsI must be looking up the wrong keywords - I can't find how to set the number of colours to 65536 or to tell the system that it has 16-bit colour.  All the hits I am getting are how to set console window colours.Another lot of searches says gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf  This file doesn't exist on my system.  Again, I think I'm looking up the wrong keywords.  Almost all the hits tell me where it is, none of them tell me what has replaced it. How do I make these settings permanent so that my login screen appears in the correct colour and the system knows what size my screen is.Edit I've found https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1493835 Apparently xorg.conf will be used if created.

Maybe the fact is that there is not a 'theory' as it is in database design. Let me explain with an example.Suppose that i want to model different ways to produce orange juice.Let say that i start by a class Oranges, that models a lot of oranges that will be of a certain variety, of a certain ripeness, they may have been froozen etc., ant these will by my Oranges class properties. Then i continue by providing Orange with a squeeze method. This seems to be correct, because ties togheter the method to the data it applies to, that is the precondition to achieve encapsulation and other valuable oop principles. But quickly it comes out that it has not been a good choiche because there is not just one way to squeeze an orange. It would be preferrable to have a Juicer class whose instances contains details of the juicing method: by hand, with an electric juicer, including the pulp, not to mention mixing different varieties of oranges. Where the latter opens an whole new cathegory of possibilities that were not available (or not achievable with ease) if each Oranges instance would have been processed using its squeeze method.Say that we have performed a 'refactoring' of our oo architecture and move to another similar example that will get us to the point.It is now a common practise to use an ORM to save class instances to database and get them back later. In what is it similar to the Oranges class example? Well, here i have a class whose instances may be persisted to a database, that is 'allow a particular process'. But the class itself does not contain the logic for doing so, that actually is in the ORM classes. So it seems that the same process of 'externalization' of the Oranges example has taken place in this case too.And here is the questionGiven that it is desireable to reduce the number of attempts-and-refactorings to the minimum, what are the questions that a programmer should put in order to determine precociously if a method should be externalized to another class? Are all the methods of a class exernalizable or is there a set of core methods that are inherently of the class itself and so not externalizable?IdeasAs i said in the beginning, i'm not completely clueless, i feel more like that a 'comprehensive' theory is missing.It's easy to put some examples: if i have a class whose instances represent invoices, i will have a method 'calculateTotalAmount'. This is clearly an inthrinsic, core method of that class, as oppsed to the methods for saving that invoice to the database that will be 'external' of the class itself. But this is not a 'final answer', but a starting point that serves to demonstrate that 'not all methods are equal', but methods may be divided into cathegories. How many (useful) cathegories can we make, and are there methodologies that put these questions?",

    "source": "A combined if/switch statement syntax with exception handling for a C#-inspired language <eos> It is sometimes necessary to try/catch exceptions inside the if condition, but not the body that follows. In C#, this is really rather cumbersome, requiring locals and code that isn't entirely obvious, at a glance, as to its operation.It is also sometimes necessary to write switch statements, which, unlike if, have more than two possible outcomes, although in C# this requires the use of a fairly unpopular syntax.Here's an idea for combining these.Merging switch with try/catchFirst, we change the fundamental syntax of switch to be close to that fairly popular replacement, but without the extra curlies:switch (condition)    case 1 { }    case 2 { }    default { }Next, we make it possible to catch exceptions in the condition. Under the hood, this inserts an appropriate try/catch block only when at least one catch is present:switch (condition)    catch FileNotFoundException e { } // use e    catch ArgumentException { }    catch { }    case 1 { }    case 2 { }    default { }Now we make it easier to chain several such statements akin to if/else chaining, by moving default one level up, and renaming it to else:switch (condition1)    catch FileNotFoundException { }    case 1 { }    case 2 { }else switch (condition2)    case abc { }    case def { }else    { }And so we have a switch merged with try/catch!Combining with 'if'Both switch and if now have else clauses, so why not allow you to mix them as you please:if (bool-condition1)    { }else if (bool-condition2)    { }else switch (string-expr)    catch FileNotFoundException { }    case thing { }else    { }(thanks ach_l!)Further improvementsSwitching on a list or range of values has been proposed and can be easily incorporated:switch (int-expression)    case 1 { }    case 2, 5 { }    case 10..50 { }else switch (string-expression)    case abc { }    case def { }else if (boolean-condition3)    { }else    { }In this case it could be really convenient to be able to reference the value in the condition clause. This can be easily incorporated by allowing one to declare a single variable in this clause the same way C#'s using allows:switch (var z = int-expression)    case 2, 5 { return z == 2 ? two : five; }    case 10..50 { return (z * 10).ToString(); }BenefitsAmong other benefits, one can now express a common error-handling scenario concisely, and yet not WTFy:switch (bool-condition)    catch FileNotFoundException e { }    case true { }    case false { }Would this solve any real-life coding difficulties you have encountered?

Then it goes to what I'd consider a reasonable speed, where each song takes anywhere between one and five seconds (the files are lossless, so maybe ~15mb on average).However, after a few hundred songs, things just slow down completely. A single file will take about five minutes to transfer, and that's a conservative estimate.

    "source": "Named pipes: several experiments leads to confusion <eos> I've come across various articles and SO questions and I am still confused about something that I use on daily basis, but never realized how confusing it can be. I am experimenting with (named) pipes in Linux.1sttry was simple: figure out how pipe buffers are working:#1mkfifo /tmp/mypipe#2echo Hello World >/tmp/mypipectrl+c#3cat /tmp/mypipeObservation:When I killed echo before cat reads the data nothing was written to pipe (cat keeps running but nothing was read from pipe). I was assuming that when you type producent >named_pipe and you will exit producent then part of data that match pipe buffer size will be written to named_pipe and will remain here until it will be read by consument (now I know that this is not how it works). So what I did next was:2ndtry was to connect consument to other end of pipe:#1mkfifo /tmp/mypipe#2echo Hello World >/tmp/mypipe#3cat /tmp/mypipeObservation:cat command displays the Hello World message and both processes ends. The interesting discovery here was that during the #2 step ps -elf does not display the echo command. It seems that echo is waiting until somebody will read from pipe and this is explanation why nothing was printed to pipe in my first attempt.3rdtry was to pipe command that will run forever and constantly write to pipe and see what will happened:#1mkfifo /tmp/mypipe#2yes >/tmp/mypipe#3cat /tmp/mypipeObservation:This worked as expected and cat printed out what yes forwarded to pipe. However I have tried to replace cat with tail -f. When I did this then tail did not print anything until the yes command was killed.4thtry is the big mystery:# 1#mkfifo /tmp/mypipe# 2#for i in $(seq 1 10000); do echo -n $i|> /tmp/mypipe; done# 3#for i in $(seq 1 10); do echo ${i}# Read:; cat /tmp/mypipe && echo ; doneAfter this the 3# command start typing something like that:1# Read:1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|22|23|24|25|26|27|28|29|30|31|32|33|34|35|36|37|38|39|40|41|42|43|44|45|46|47|48|49|50|51|52|53|54|55|56|57|58|59|60|61|62|63|64|65|66|67|68|69|70|71|72|73|74|75|76|77|78|79|80|81|82|83|84|85|86|87|88|89|90|91|92|93|94|95|96|97|98|99|100|101|102|103|104|105|106|107|108|2# Read:109|3# Read:110|4# Read:111|5# Read:112|6# Read:113|114|115|7# Read:116|8# Read:117|9# Read:118|119|120|121|122|123|124|125|126|127|128|129|130|131|132|133|134|135|136|137|138|139|140|141|142|143|144|145|146|147|148|149|150|151|152|153|154|155|156|157|158|159|160|161|162|163|164|165|166|167|168|169|170|171|172|173|174|175|176|177|178|179|180|181|182|183|184|185|186|187|188|189|190|191|192|193|194|195|196|197|198|199|200|201|202|203|204|205|206|207|208|209|210|211|212|213|214|215|216|217|218|219|220|221|222|223|224|225|226|227|228|229|230|231|232|233|234|235|236|237|238|239|240|241|242|243|244|245|246|247|248|249|250|251|252|253|254|255|256|257|258|259|260|261|262|263|264|265|266|267|268|269|270|271|272|273|274|275|276|277|278|279|280|281|282|283|284|285|286|287|288|289|290|291|292|293|294|295|10# Read:296|297|298|299|300|301|302|303|304|305|306|307|308|309|310|311|312|313|314|315|316|317|318|319|320|321|322|323|324|325|326|327|328|329|Questions:1st and 2nd try:Are the named pipes equivalent to classic | pipes as they areknows e.g. from bash in this particular case?Does producent always wait for consument? If yes then what is purpose of pipe buffers? Is this behavior known as blocking communication?How does Linux know when the consument is connected to pipe and thus when the communication can happen? I've tried lsof named_pipe but it gives me nothing, where is this information stored? I have also try following and result was that cat cannot read from pipe.#1mkfifo /tmp/mypipe#2echo 1 >/tmp/mypipe#3rm /tmp/mypipe#4mkfifo /tmp/mypipe#5cat /tmp/mypipeIs typing: producent >/tmp/mypipethe equivalent of typing command | I mean the situation when somebody wants to pipe one command to another but forget to type another command after pipe (ps in this case also did not show first command)?3rd try:What is difference between cat and tail -f in this particular case?4th try:What is going on here? Why the chunks of read data are not the exactsize? I was expecting output as:1# Read:   1|   2# Read:   2|   3# Read:   3|PS:Also I have tried different order of starting commands (reading first and writing after) but the result was the same.PPS:I hope this is clear but:Producer = process that writes to pipe.Consumer = process that reads from pipe.Is this possible explain to guy which has mostly scripting knowledge with bit of C? Thank you very much.EDIT in reply to: Joe SewellOK Clear 2. I understand that both run in parallel, or in other words, following two are not the same:find | lessvsfind > /tmp/file && less /tmp/fileMy further observation discovers that, when I run following, HDD is not working seems that it is stopped until less command has enough data to displayfind | lessWhen I hit shifg+g (go to the end of file in less) HDD starts immediately to work and data starts outputting. Does this mean that when less command has enough data to display it will somehow tell find to not produce further data? This is what you mean by synchronization? Also the amount of data writes to pipe corresponds to it buffer size? I have also noticed that find changes it state (ps aux - stat column) from S+ to D+ after I hit shift+g in lessS    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)+    is in the foreground process group.[wakatana@~] [63 files, 178Mb]> ps aux | egrep -w 'less|find'wakatana     6071  0.0  0.0  12736  1088 pts/5    S+   23:15   0:00 findwakatana     6072  0.0  0.0   7940   928 pts/5    S+   23:15   0:00 lesswakatana     6183  0.0  0.0   7832   892 pts/6    S+   23:20   0:00 egrep --color=auto -w less|find[wakatana@~] [63 files, 178Mb]> ps aux | egrep -w 'less|find'wakatana     6071  0.0  0.0  12808  1304 pts/5    D+   23:15   0:00 findwakatana     6072  0.0  0.0   9556  2508 pts/5    S+   23:15   0:00 lesswakatana     6193  0.0  0.0   7832   892 pts/6    S+   23:21   0:00 egrep --color=auto -w less|findWho sends this signal, consument to producent? If yes then howconsument know that he is connected to the pipe which already hasproducent (e.g. my example with rm pipe)?OK ClearOK ClearI think that the new lines is not the case that confuses me. Based on my previous observations (and you confirmed that: Yes, both ends wait for each other.). I was expecting this:I. 1st iteration in 1st loop will write to pipe and because nobody isreading it will wait here.II. When 2nd loop is issued then the data which were written by 1stloop in 1st iteration will be read, nothing more was written here sonothing more can be read.III. 2nd loop will wait for next data to be written by 1st loop or(because order no matter) 1st loop will wait until written data willbe read by 2nd loop, and so on and so on.Because of this I was expecting that one write will corresponds to one read. I was also verifying if loop is not running so I modified a bit original command to see if something will be printed to STDOUT even if consument wont be reading, but nothing was printed.for i in $(seq 1 10000); do  if [ $(( $i % 5 )) -eq 0 ]; then    echo $i;  else    echo -n $i|> /tmp/mypipe;  fi;doneSince the writing process isn't sending any newlines, the reader simply reads until it's told it got enough.Who will tell consument that he's got enough?In the first case it's probably because the fifo's buffer filled up,How can I fill buffer if communication is blocked (as i described above)?and therefore got flushed through to the reader.What do you mean by this? Sorry for my english.While there are ways to make communication asynchronous ...Can you please briefly describe what is the difference between asynchronous and synchronous in this case?",

As I have read about it, a typical entity system has:1) Entities - which are merely ID tags which have a number of components2) Components - which contain data on various aspects of an enity that the component is responsible for3) Systems - which update relevant components of every entity. Say, a rendering system updates the rendering component, or simply saying, draws a picture that is stored in the data of that component. A positional and movement system handles position and movement of each entity who has a corresponding component.These statements follow from this article which in my opition tries to be the most clear and pure in it's statements - But the author did not explain how the interaction between systems should be realized. For example, the rendering system must know the data from the positional component of an entity in order to draw it in a correct position. And so on.So the question is - how should I implement the interaction between the various systems?",

Is that true?Should my interface specifications be telling any implementers I'll give you an IReadOnlyCollection, but you can just give me any old IEnumerable back? (Again, if deferred execution makes sense, I would provide an IEnumerable as a parameter type instead.) This makes those methods the reverse, accepting a narrow/conservative set but emitting a broad/liberal one. However, this seems right to me because with the dependency inversion, in reality the input arguments when the method is called are really the output arguments of the core system (specifying the interface).I'm just wondering if my thinking is right on this or not. It seems that making the implementer side as easy as possible is really where the benefit is.I'm realizing that part of the issue comes from my concern about not requiring implementers to think deeply about whether deferred execution makes sense or not. Knowing when an enumerable will be enumerated can be very important in a system, and with the separation of concerns that an interface can help bring to code, I wouldn't want to be so liberal in what the interface method outputs (which is ultimately an input to the core system) that improperly-deferred IEnumerables get thrown around...This is not about speed.

It just provides with commit.getDiff() which only compares a commit to its parent, but I needed to compare to arbitrary commits.Git model is as follows:commit -> patches -> hunks -> modified linesI need to traverse this tree, gather all the modified lines for all the hunks in all the patches, and return.The thing is, all the calls that go deeper into this tree (ie. commit.patches(), patch.hunks(), hunks.lines(), are all async (Promises), so instead of simply doing a forEach at each level, I had to recursively visit the patches tree.I created a context object to help me iterate it, maintain cursors and stack state, and call expressJS next() function to pass to the next middleware when all the tree has been traversed and there are no more patches to iterate.exports.getDiffBetweenCommits = function (req, res, next) {  var commitID1 = req.params.stageID1;  var commitID2 = req.params.stageID2;  var repo;  Git.Repository.open('/path/to/git/repo')    .then(function (repository) {      repo = repository;      return repo.getCommit(commitID1);    })    .then(function (firstCommit) {      req.commit1 = firstCommit;      return repo.getCommit(commitID2);    })    .then(function (commit2) {      req.commit2 = commit2;      req.gitOptions = null;      return;    })    .then(function () {      return req.commit1.getTree();    })    .then(function (commitTree) {      req.commit1Tree = commitTree;      return req.commit2.getTree();    })    .then(function (commitTree) {      req.commit2Tree = commitTree;      return;    })    .then(function () {      return req.commit1Tree.diff(req.commit2Tree);    })    .then(function (diffs) {      var diffResult = [];      req.diffResult = diffResult;      var context = {        next: next,        diffResult: diffResult,        modificationCount: 0,        pushPatches: function (patches) {          this.patches = patches;          this.currentPatch = -1;        },        nextPatch: function () {          this.currentPatch++;          if (this.currentPatch !== this.patches.length) {            this.patches[this.currentPatch].hunks().then(processHunks.bind(null, this));          } else {            this.next();          }        },        pushHunks: function (hunks) {          this.hunks = hunks;          this.currentHunk = -1;        },        nextHunk: function () {          this.currentHunk++;          if (this.currentHunk !== this.hunks.length) {            var hunkHeader = this.hunks[this.currentHunk].header().trim();            log(hunkHeader.substring(0, hunkHeader.length - 1));            this.hunks[this.currentHunk].lines().then(processLines.bind(null, this));          } else {            this.nextPatch();          }        },        increaseModificationCount: function () {          this.modificationCount++;          req.modificationCount = this.modificationCount;        }      };      diffs.patches().then(processPatches.bind(null, context));    });};function processPatches(context, patches) {  if (patches.length === 0) {    return context.next();  }  context.pushPatches(patches);  context.nextPatch();}function processHunks(context, hunks) {  if (hunks.length === 0) {    return context.next();  }  context.pushHunks(hunks);  context.nextHunk();}function processLines(context, lines) {  lines.forEach(function (line) {    var diffString = String.fromCharCode(line.origin()) + line.content().trim();    log(diffString);    var originChar = String.fromCharCode(line.origin());    var diffLine = {      contents: line.content().trim(),      isAddition: originChar === '+',      isDeletion: originChar === '-',      isContext: originChar === ' '    };    if (diffLine.isAddition || diffLine.isDeletion) {      context.increaseModificationCount();    }    context.diffResult.push(diffLine);  });  context.nextHunk();}I would like a review of this because although it works, it feels too complex and procedural, so perhaps I'm missing a simpler or more proper solution here.",

    "source": "More efficient alternative that checks if a list can be made a palindrome <eos> For my algorithms and data structures class, I have to write an algorithm that is more efficient in the worst case than the following algorithm:def algo_X(A):    i = 0    j = len(A)-1    while i < j:        if A[i] != A[j]:            k = i + 1            while k < j:                if A[i] == A[k]:                    A[k], A[j] = A[j], A[k]                    break                elif A[j] == A[k]:                    A[k], A[i] = A[i], A[k]                    break                else:                    k += 1            if k == j:                return False        i += 1        j -= 1    return TrueThis algorithm returns True if the elements of list passed as argument can be manipulated (swapped) in order to create a new list, which, if we read from the left or from the right, has the same order of elements (palindrome). Else returns False.For example, this list ['a', 'a', 'b', '2', 'b', 'b', 2] can be ordered so that we have a list with the same elements in the same positions, if we read at the same time from the left and from the right: ['a', 'b', '2', 'b', '2', 'b', a].Note that this is my interpretation of the algorithm, they did not tell us what this algorithm was supposed to do.If I am not wrong, this algorithm, in the worst case (and average case), is O(n2), and (n) in the best case.The exercise specifically states that I don't have necessarily to change the list (like in algo_X), but just to return True or False specifying respectively if the list can be made a palindrome or not. We cannot use libraries, but just built-in constructs. We cannot even use slice, for example. This is because we don't know exactly the time complexity of those functions. I will edit my questionTo make a better algorithm for the worst case, I thought I could use merge sort, whose time complexity is always n*log(n), plus a loop, which would not make the algorithm worse, asymptotically.This is my merge function for my merge sort function:def merge(A, B):    ls = []    a, b = 0, 0    while a < len(A) and b < len(B):        if A[a] <= B[b]:            ls.append(A[a])            a += 1        else:            ls.append(B[b])            b += 1    while a < len(A):        ls.append(A[a])        a += 1    while b < len(B):        ls.append(B[b])        b += 1    return lsThis is my merge sort function:def merge_sort(A):    if len(A) < 2:  # basic condition        return A    L = merge_sort(A[0:len(A)//2])    R = merge_sort(A[len(A)//2:])    return merge(L, R)Finally, here's my alternative, which returns True, if the list can be made a palindrome, False otherwise:def better_algo_x(A):    if len(A) < 2:        return True    sorted_A = merge_sort(A)    odd_groups = 0    current = sorted_A[0]    c = 1  # Used to count the number of characters that are equal between them    for i in range(1, len(sorted_A)):        if current == sorted_A[i]:            c += 1        else:            if c % 2 == 1:                odd_groups += 1            if odd_groups > 1:                return False            current = sorted_A[i]            c = 1    # for the last group of characters    if c % 2 == 1:        odd_groups += 1    if odd_groups > 1:        return False    return TrueI have a few questions:Are my functions correct?  Is my analysis of the time complexity of the algorithm algo_X correct?Does my better_algo_x do what it is supposed to do? Does it do it in n*log(n) in the worst case?Can I still improve it? How?Do you know (other) better alternatives for algo_X?Of course, some questions might seem silly, but I would like to hear the opinion of some experts. Of course, I have tried my algorithms.",

I feel like this framework is a sledgehammer to crack a nut.The builder is annoying. Should I not have made one? How to change the definition of the control polygon easily?My control points are directed (have a forward, and a backward). This prevents me from defining a polygon as Abwd--->Bbwd at the moment. How can I remedy this? A ControlPointReverser?I intend to allow making constraints between two distinct control point's tangents (like ctrlA.forceParallel(ctrlB)). I also might introduce constraints on location (like ctrlA.sitOnTopOf(ctrlB)) or even curvature. How do you feel about applying the same manager mechanic throughout all these constraints?Any complaints on style?",

    "source": "Does Second X is NP-complete imply X is NP-complete? <eos> Second $X$ problem is the problem of deciding the existence of another solution different from some given solution for problem instance. For some $NP$-complete problems, the second solution version is $NP$-complete (deciding the existence of another solution for the partial Latin square completion problem) while for others it is either trivial (Second NAE SAT) or it can not be $NP$-complete (Second Hamiltonian cycle in cubic graphs) under widely believed complexity conjecture. I am interested in the opposite direction. We assume a natural $NP$ problem $X$ where there is natural efficient verifier that verifies a natural interesting relation $(x, c)$ where $x$ is an input instance and $c$ is a short witness of membership of $x$ in $X$. All witnesses are indistinguishable to the verifier. The validity of witnesses must be decided by running the natural verifier and it does not have any knowledge of any correct witness ( both examples in the comments are solutions by definition).  Does Second $X$ is NP-complete imply $X$ is NP-complete for all natural problems $X$?In other words, Are there any natural problem $X$ where this implication fails?. Or equivalently,Is there any natural problem $X$ in $NP$ and not known to be $NP$-complete but its Second $X$ problem is $NP$-complete?EDIT: Thanks to Marzio's comments, I am not interested in contrived counter-examples. I am only interested in natural and interesting counter-examples for NP-complete problems $X$ similar to the ones above. An acceptable answer is either a proof of the above implication or a counter-example Second X problem which is defined for natural, interesting, and well known $NP$ problem $X$.EDIT 2: Thanks to the fruitful discussion with David Richerby, I have edited the question to emphasis that my interest is only in natural problems $X$.EDIT 3: Motivation: First, the existence of such implication may simplify the $NP$-completeness proofs of many $NP$ problems. Secondly, the existence of the implication links the complexity of deciding the uniqueness of solution to the problem of deciding existence of a solution for $NP$ problems.",

In this, we are only allowed to use a specific language level.So of cause I could take a list of mutable lists and, in search of an item in row n and column m, get the m-th mutable list and go throught it until position n.

For example, Ctrl- (left arrow) gives me ^[[D on screen (screen256-color term).  gives me the same result.Weird thing is that Alt-key combinations work fine.In particular, I would like to get the 'forward-word' and 'backward-word' key bindings working under screen.I have tried modifying .inputrc to work with various terminals. As such, my .inputrc looks something like this:$if term=xterm    'xxx' : forward-word # xxx key gotten from Ctrl-V    'xxx' : backward-word$endif$if term=screen-256color......I have also tried various terminals by setting the TERM of my bash profile, setting TERM on .screenrc, and setting the Putty keyboard terminal mappings. The obvious ones, linux and xterm, don't work. However, I haven't tried every permutation of settings for obvious reasons.Additional info:I stand corrected, arrow key combinations are the only combinations that do not work.The distro is RHEL 6. .screenrc:term xterm # tried other terms as wellshell -$SHELL # login shell to reload configscaption string %whardstatus alwayslastline %{b kw}%H %{r}%1` %{w}| %{g}%c %{w}| %{y}%d.%m.%Y %{w}| %{g}%l %{w}| %{-b kw}%u %-Lw%{= rW}%50> %n%f %t %{-}%+Lw%<vbell offdefscrollback 5000Putty's default keyboard mode ESC [n~.

    "source": "Understanding ext4/jbd2 transactions <eos> I'm trying to debug a bit of trouble I'm having with I/O latency on a system using ext4, but I'm a bit stumped in that I don't understand its journalling as well as I'd like to.What I'm wondering in particular is at what point disk blocks are actually written, both into the journal and for real. My assumption thus far is that, when some metadata operation like, say, a rename(), is done by a user process, the filesystem will ensure that the disk blocks that the operation needs to touch are in the buffer cache, carry out the necessary changes in memory on the cached pages, while creating a jbd2 transaction that records the changed pages, and then, at some later point, write those pages into the journal, and then, only when that is done and at some further arbitrarily later point, write them into the filesystem proper. Please do correct me if I'm wrong somewhere in here.Assuming I'm somewhat correct, I'm wondering what might trigger the write to the journal to be carried out. Is it when some more general FS/VM part of the kernel decides that it's time to flush the dirty pages? Is it when there is no more space in the journal to allocate for more transactions? What happens if the kernel needs to reclaim some of the dirty pages from the buffer cache? Would that trigger the journal-write and main-write in forced succession?Also, what is the standard terminology? When I see a transaction being referred to being committed, what does that mean, more precisely?",

Is it the case that there always exist a function $W': Q \\times Q \\to \\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ such that $\\forall S, S' \\subseteq Q, \\forall s, s' \\in S$:$$\\sum_{s'' \\in S'}{W(s, s'')} = \\sum_{s'' \\in S'}{W(s', s'')} \\Leftrightarrow \\sum_{s'' \\in S'}{W'(s, s'')} = \\sum_{s'' \\in S'}{W'(s', s'')}$$?I believe, at least for the finite case, this should be possible and I'm trying to prove this constructively by finding $W'$.So let $\\epsilon \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ be a rational such that $\\forall s_0,s_1,s_2,s_3 \\in Q, \\epsilon < |W(s_0, s_1) - W(s_2, s_3)|$ whenever that difference isn't $0$.Obviously if we just round every non-rational weight in a grid with spacing $\\epsilon$ we will not preserve equalities and I believe it'll be quite difficult to restore the exact relations.So my idea is to round one weight at a time, and then fix the equalities that get broken by modifying only non-rational weights and repeating the process until there are only rational weights.So start by taking two subsets $S, S' \\subseteq Q$ and take $s \\in S$ and $s'' \\in S'$ such that $W(s, s'') \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.Now we can round this number to the nearest rational of the form $k\\cdot \\epsilon$.Let $e = W(s, s'') - W'(s, s'')$ is the error we introduced.Now if there was an $s' \\in S$ and an $s'''$ such that $W(s', s''') = W(s, s'')$ then we modify that weight in the same manner, and thus the iff condition still holds for $s$ and $s'$.Otherwise for $s' \\in S$ we must have that some (more than one) weight $W(s', s''') \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$ and we can subtract $e$ from it and preserve the condition for $s$ and $s'$ with respect to $S$ and $S'$.However we have now changed some other weight, and thus while we may have preserved the equality between $S$ and $S'$, we may have broken it for other subsets. So we have to consider every subset that is either a subset or superset of $S$ and $S'$, verify if we have broken that iff condition, and if so we must find an other weight and change it, and repeat the process until it we find an equilibrium. But does this actually happen?My question is:Does there exist such $W'$ or am I trying to build a non-existent function?If $W'$ exists, is the above approach feasible in some way, or should I completely change strategy in order to find $W'$? Do you know any particular trick that can help in devising $W'$?",

Alexa challenges Nick to play thefollowing game:In each move, Nick can remove one integer from the top of either stack A or stack B. Nick keeps a running sum of the integers he removes from the two stacks. Nick is disqualified from the game if, at any point, his running sum becomes greater than some integer given at the beginning of the game.Nick's fine/score is the total number of integers he has removed from the two stacks.Given A, B, and m for g games, find the maximum possible score Nick can achieve (i.e., the maximumnumber of integers he can remove without being disqualified)Link to the problem:  https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/university-codesprint-2/challenges/game-of-two-stacksMy solution(greedy approach):Pick(pop) the smallest element between the one present on top of the stack A and the other present on top of the stack B. Increment sum by the value of popped element and total(number of ints) by 1.Repeat 1 until either sum becomes greater than asked or one of the two stacks get empty.If one of the two stacks get empty then pop ints from the other stack until the current sum exceeds the asked limit.Editorial solution:This problem can be solved in linear time. We'll begin by taking as many integers as possible from stack A without exceeding the sum. Once we've done this we'll start taking integers from B, but whenever the sum becomes larger than the limit, we'll put integers back into stack A. Make sure to update the answer (the number of integers) as the traversal through stack B takes place. Break the loop when you have put back all integers that was taken from A and it's not possible to take any more integers from B.Please explain where am I getting wrong and what is the intuition behind the editorial solution?",

I have another machine (HostB) with one NIC on the same switch. HostB is not configured for Internet access yet. HostA has its default gateway and DNS servers appropriately configured. IPv4 is being used. OSes on the hosts are Ubuntu 13 and Fedora17.What I want: Now, I would like HostB to have Internet connectivity, too. Is this possible using 'some' combination of iptables, virtual tun/tap devices, or a VPN setup between HostA and HostB, etc? What I already know and can do: Currently, I can use an ssh-based SOCKS proxy on HostB (ssh -D 9050 UserA@HostA) and route traffic of select 'socksifiable' applications on HostB via this proxy to HostA and beyond. However, sadly, not all applications are socksifiable. Now, I know very well that if HostA had 2 NICs, I could have used some iptables rules to convert HostA into a gateway that would then route traffic between its NIC-1 and NIC-2 (where NIC-1 would be connected to HostB and NIC-2 to Internet). But installing another NIC in HostA is not feasible for me.PS: I had posted this earlier on superuser.com but got no useful information.edit 1:network informationHost A::> ip addr[...]2: p4p1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000link/ether d4:be:d9:d5:46:05 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ffinet 192.168.22.9/24 brd 192.168.22.255 scope global p4p1 :> ip routedefault via 192.168.22.254 dev p4p1 proto static192.168.22.0/24 dev p4p1 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.22.9Host B::> ip addr[...]2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000link/ether 30:f9:ed:d9:2e:20 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ffinet 192.168.22.234/24 brd 192.168.22.255 scope global eth0 :> ip route169.254.0.0/16 dev eth0 scope link metric 1000192.168.22.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.22.234 metric 1",

I'll migrate this as requested.A bug is visiting circles, and an adversary wishes to maximize his travel time.The adversary places a circle on every turn. The bug walks from it's current position directly toward the center of the newest circle, then stops when it encounters the interior of the circle (thus: it doesn't walk if a circle is played covering its location). This is the bug's turn.There are $N$ circles available to the adversary. Each subsequent circle has radius less than the previous circle. Each circle must intersect the intersection of all previously played circles. That is, all circles must have a common intersection once all are played.EDIT:  The adversary is free to choose the radii of the circles, subject to the constraint that the radii monotonically decrease.Questions and Answers:Is the distance as $N\\to\\infty$ bounded? A: No, an example of an adversary strategy is given by this AnswerWhat is the maximum distance the bug must travel over the playing of $N$ circles. A: it grows at $\\Theta(\\log(N))$, by the same answer.Variant 2: The bug walks directly toward the intersection of the two most recently played circles.UPDATE: This variant was addressed, under the assumption that the bug can only remember the last 2 circles played here. The result was again an unbounded distance. What impact does unliminted memory have? i.e., the bug goes to the intersection of all previously played circles. This produced a loose bound of $O(d)$, where $d$ is the diameter of the first circle. Obviously it cannot be less than this. See here. The current upper bound was $1000\\times d$. This was obtained by approximating the worst-case path as a tour around progressively smaller circles. It was shown that the bug always makes progress towards the final intersection, thus reducing the next-step distance it must travel.I suspect the distance traveled is a small constant times the circumference of the first circle, but I'm not currently able to provide a good proof.",

I tried to reduce it to some NP-hard problems but didn't get anywhere, especially because the numbers are nonnegative and thus in an optimal partition big sets need to have smaller weight which seems to be some kind of balancing problem instead of a packing problem (which I am more familiar with).",

And all cycles of connected unidrected graphs are the all sets for this problem. This is quite specific setting for the problem and I wonder whether there can be improvements in this specific setting.I would like to work out all the details myself but the question is - is there the general theory of all cycles in grpahs (connected undirected). Like - what is the number of cycles, what is the minimum and maximum lenght of them, how much common nodes they can have and so on? Mybe there are connections with group theory - e.g. cycle could be some kind of orbit for a group element (in rude language). Any such information provides the constraint on the initial problem and therefore - the complexity improvements can be possible to achieve in this specific setting.Google gives a lot about Hamiltonian and similar specific cycles.

Recently a potential client approached me to create a JavaScript effect for his website. The effect was quite complex and it was not generic. That is, every time the design of the website would change the JavaScript code would have to be modified.Due to this nature of the code, I told the client that I will not be able to provide maintenance for this project. I will be happy to modify the code in the future but I will be doing the cost estimation each time there is a modification. The client was not happy with this. I thought of calculating the probability of the modifications the client may ask per year and multiply the initial estimate by that so that the maintenance becomes free. For example, if the cost of the initial project is $100 and I assume that the client will ask me to modify the code 4 times a year I would charge him $ (100 + 4*100). But I think this would be way too much and the client would deny to pay such a high amount.I have just started freelancing and the cost estimation part related to maintenance confuses me a lot.

    "source": "Determining Length of a walk in Nondeterministic Finite Automata with Lambda Transitions <eos> I am learning about CS Theory and specifically Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA) right now. In my book I came across a section of text that discussed a way to determine the length of a walk stating specifically that :If a transition graph has a walk labeled $w$, then there is a walk w of length no more than $\\Lambda + (1 + \\Lambda)|w|$ where $\\Lambda$ is the number of $\\lambda$ transitions in the graph.The book does not define $|w|$ which is causing part of my confusion. I'm assuming $|w|$ is the length of the label of the walk. So in this case it would be 1 when going from $q_1 \\to q_0 \\to q1$ because $a$ is the only labeled edge.I am trying to understand this concept and how it works because when I have tested out this claim it has not held true.Here is the test I did with this NFA$q_1$ is the final state. So assuming you were trying to find the length of the walk $a$, the label would indicate that the length is 1 (e.g. $\\delta^* (q_1, a)$) . However due to the lambdas you actually have $\\lambda \\lambda a$ to go from $q_1 \\to q_0 \\to q_1$.This theorem doesn't hold with my math though because it is defined as  + (1 + )|w| where  is the number of -edges in the graph.Since there are two -edges (and it doesn't state whether it means -edges in the walk itself or in the graph in total...) this would then be 2 + (1 + 2)|w|. So thats 2 + 3|w|. This clearly is more than 3, which is the length of q1 -> q1 of a.What am I missing here? Any help is greatly appreciated.This comes from Peter Linz An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata 5th edition.Some more information about the argument for this claim:While -edges may be repeated, there is always a walk in which every repeated -edge is separated by an edge labeled with a nonempty symbol. Otherwise, the walk contains a cycle labeled , which can be replaced by a simple path without changing the label of the walk.Also the book never names this as a theorem or lemma or anything of the sort so it has been very difficult to find online resources about this topic.",

I am a beginner in image processing. Ss please any help is appreciated. Quoting some lines from the paper:We use the direction contribution of the segments to estimate the degree for each pixel on the thick-line image. Given a binary image, for each black pixel $p(r,c)$, let $D_k(r,c)$ denote the orientation distance between the pixel and the boundary point along the $k$th quantized orientation, where $k = 1, 2, \\dots, M$, and $M$ is an integer that denotes the quantization number from $0^\\circ$ to $360^\\circ$ . The orientation distance is called point-to-boundary orientation distance (PBOD). The distribution of the PBODs contains information   about the degree of each pixel. We can easily tell that the PBODs along the quantized orientations of the branches are much larger than that along other quantized orientation. So, to estimate the degree of each pixel, we need only calculate the number of the crests of the distribution of all the PBODs of the pixel. Figure 2 shows some cases of the distribution. The resolution of quantization is $3^\\circ$. What is quantisation and orientation distance, and how to implement these in matlab?",

I'm a purely front-end web dev, I can't say I'm very experienced in this.Anyway the way I spawn my enemies is like this : at xyz gameTime, a spawner object is pushed into the game. This spawner object add various enemies in various configurations, using that type of interface, I hope the code is self explanatory:state.enemies.push(enemies[this.enemyType].add({  pos: [this.pos[0], this.pos[1]],  angle: this.angle,  rotation: this.enemyRotation,  path: this.path}));But I'm not here for game design review so let me talk about what I want advice on.basically you can see my enemy module here: https://github.com/acezard/aceforceone/blob/develop/src/entities/enemies.jsLet me explain it bit by bit.This is the global config object that manages only the default settings of every enemy type. That is, it doesn't contain any vector/rotation/position infos, because these settings are injected at enemy creation. // Config Objectvar enemyConfig = {  redBomber: {    url: 'assets/images/enemy-xs-1.svg',    pos: [0, 0],    size: [75, 53],    speed: 100,    hitpoints: 10,    ROF: 100,    score: 100,    burst: {      amount: 3,      delay: 1000,      counter: 3    },  },  scout: {    url: 'assets/images/scout.png',    pos: [0, 0],    size: [50, 44],    speed: 500,    hitpoints: 2,    score: 50  },  rotatingPlat: {    url: 'assets/images/platpart.png',    pos: [0, 0],    size: [150, 44],    speed: 30,    hitpoints: 100,    ROF: 200,    score: 250,    burst: {      amount: 1000,      delay: 1000,      counter: 1000    },  },  rogueLeader: {    url: 'assets/images/rogueleader.svg',    pos: [0, 0],    size: [200, 89],    speed: 100,    hitpoints: 60,    score: 300,    ROF: 500,  },  drone: {    url: 'assets/images/drone.svg',    pos: [0, 0],    size: [50, 62],    speed: 300,    hitpoints: 5,    score: 75  },};Next we have a global enemy constructor, managing every enemy type as a base. It contains a mix of the default settings shown above, and the what I call active settings, that is, arguments different for every enemy entity even if they are of the same type (like position). This constructor also have the basic methods and a blank shoot method, because each enemy type has his own implementation (doesn't seem right?).// Base enemy constructorvar EnemyEntity = function(settingsDefault, settingsActive) {  // Default  this.active = true;  this.speed = settingsDefault.speed;  this.hitpoints = settingsDefault.hitpoints;  this.lastFire = Date.now();  this.score = settingsDefault.score;  this.ROF = settingsDefault.ROF || null;  this.maxHitpoints = settingsDefault.hitpoints;  this.rotating = settingsDefault.rotating || null;  if (settingsDefault.burst) {    this.burst = {      amount: settingsDefault.burst.amount,      delay: settingsDefault.burst.delay,      counter: settingsDefault.burst.counter    };  }  this.sprite = new Sprite({    url: settingsDefault.url,    pos: settingsDefault.pos,    size: settingsDefault.size,    rotated: true  });  // Active  this.angle = settingsActive.angle;  this.pos = settingsActive.pos;  this.radians = settingsActive.angle * Math.PI / 180;  this.vector = [Math.cos(this.radians) * this.speed, Math.sin(this.radians) * this.speed];  this.rotation = settingsActive.rotation || 0;  this.path = settingsActive.path || null;};// Update methodEnemyEntity.prototype.shoot = function() {};EnemyEntity.prototype.update = function(dt) {  if (this.outOfBounds()) {    this.active = false;    return;  }  if (this.path == angular) {    paths.angular(this);  }  this.pos[0] += this.vector[0] * dt;  this.pos[1] += this.vector[1] * dt;};EnemyEntity.prototype.outOfBounds = function() {  return this.pos[1] > canvas.height || this.pos[0] < 0 || this.pos[0] > canvas.width;};// Draw methodEnemyEntity.prototype.render = function() {    canvas.ctx.save();    canvas.ctx.translate(this.pos[0], this.pos[1]);    canvas.ctx.translate(this.sprite.size[0] / 2, this.sprite.size[1] / 2);    canvas.ctx.rotate(Math.PI / 180 * this.rotation);    this.sprite.render(canvas.ctx);    canvas.ctx.restore();};This part is another constructor, used to create enemy factories. Basically its only role is to share an ADD method, used by every enemy factory.// Factory constructorvar EnemyFactory = function() {};EnemyFactory.prototype.add = function(settings) {   return new this.type(settings);};Now this is an example of what a specific enemy factory looks like. I put two so you can see how much WET code this is. Basically, we first create a constructor, by calling the EnemyEntity constructor with this, and with the active settings. We also get enemyentity methods with calling it as a prototype. The shoot function is different for each enemy.Then we have the enemy factory per se, basically it's constructed from the EnemyFactory constructor, and giving the specific Enemy constructor as a type, so we then can use myEnemy.add(activeSettings);// RedBombervar RedBomber = function(settings) {  EnemyEntity.call(this, enemyConfig.redBomber, settings);};RedBomber.prototype = Object.create(EnemyEntity.prototype);RedBomber.prototype.shoot = function() {  var now = Date.now();  // If the enemy can shoot  if (this.pos[1] > 0 && this.burst.counter && now - this.lastFire > this.ROF) {    var x = this.pos[0] + this.sprite.size[0] / 2;    var y = this.pos[1] + this.sprite.size[1] / 2;    state.ebullets.push(weapons.red.addMissile({x: x, y: y, angle: 90}));    state.ebullets.push(weapons.red.addMissile({x: x, y: y, angle: 80}));    state.ebullets.push(weapons.red.addMissile({x: x, y: y, angle: 100}));    this.burst.counter--;    this.lastFire = now;    return;  } else  if (!this.burst.counter && now - this.lastFire > this.burst.delay) {    this.burst.counter = this.burst.amount;  }};function RedBomberFactory () {};RedBomberFactory.prototype = new EnemyFactory();RedBomberFactory.prototype.type = RedBomber;var redBomber = new RedBomberFactory();// Rogue Leadervar RogueLeader = function(settings) {  EnemyEntity.call(this, enemyConfig.rogueLeader, settings);};RogueLeader.prototype = Object.create(EnemyEntity.prototype);RogueLeader.prototype.shoot = function() {  var now = Date.now();  // If the enemy can shoot  if (this.pos[1] > 0 && now - this.lastFire > this.ROF) {    var x = this.pos[0];    var y = this.pos[1];    state.ebullets.push(weapons.redRay.addMissile({x: x + this.sprite.size[0] * 0.3, y: y + this.sprite.size[1] * 0.6, angle: this.rotation - 90}));    state.ebullets.push(weapons.redRay.addMissile({x: x + this.sprite.size[0] * 0.7, y: y + this.sprite.size[1] * 0.6, angle: this.rotation - 90}));    this.lastFire = now;  }};function RogueLeaderFactory () {};RogueLeaderFactory.prototype = new EnemyFactory();RogueLeaderFactory.prototype.type = RogueLeader;var rogueLeader = new RogueLeaderFactory();Then we exports our factory functionsmodule.exports = {  redBomber: redBomber,  scout: scout,  rotatingPlat: rotatingPlat,  rogueLeader: rogueLeader,  drone: drone};What's the problem then ? As you can see there is a lot of repetition in my code, every new enemy type adds a LOT of code, but I only really need the shoot method. Though I'm not sure right now how I could manage that better and ask for your advice. Any other consideration of the code is of course much appreciated",

So I made this Apex/Visualforce combo that searches long text fields, makes adding and removing fields a snap, has a customizable view, and is generally easy(er) to work with.This basically does everything by shuttling JSON strings back and forth between the view and the controller. If your browser doesn't have Javascript enabled, you're going to have a bad time.Other cool things:Works for any custom record type, and any custom field. You specify which in the view; theoretically, there's no need to touch any Apex, just good ol' HTML/Visualforce.Detects whether or not one of the fields by which you want to search is a picklist. If it is, it gets all the values for the picklist and prints them out in the DOM as a multi-select picklist. Ditto for checkboxes.It's super-easy to reference fields and make them appear in the view however you want.You can sort results just by clicking on column headers.Salesforce has two methods of searching for records: SOSL and SOQL. One's great for searching for text strings; the other one's great for everything else.

The model is configured to perform boosting (10 trials) and it has a miss-classification cost function (100:1 where 100 is the cost for miss-classifying a Negative sample as Positive and 1 is the cost for miss-classifying Negative as Positive).Looking at predicted probabilities generated by the model, I can see that it ranges from 0 to 1 for each class. i.e, I have instances where the predicted class (C1) has a probability lower than 0.5 ( for example: predicted class=C1 and predicted probability=0.1 ) - This is where the question arises: if P(C1) < 50% why is it classified as C1 (there are only two classes, C1 and C2)Based on my understanding of decision trees, the predicted probabilities are often generated based on the percentage of test cases on the leaf node that were labeled in each class divided by the total number of instances hitting that leaf node. This method will dictate the probability for two classes must sum up to 1.My question is why does the model classify an instance in class C1 if it has only got 0.1 confidence in it. Does a predicted probability of 0.1 on class C1 mean that there is a 0.9 confidence in it belonging to class C2? If so, why does it classify an instance in class C1 is it has less than 0.5 confidence in it?My own theory is that this might be due to boosting and miss-classification cost and the way they are influencing the predicted class.",

While there was an easy solution, I gave a more general solution to solve the more general problem for an NxM matrix. A handful of people commented that this generalisation was bad because it made the solution more complex. One such comment is voted +8.Putting aside the hard-to-explain voting effects on SO, there are two types of complexity to be considered here:Runtime complexity, i.e. how fast does the code runCode complexity, i.e. how difficult is the code to read and understandThe question of runtime complexity is something that requires a better understanding of the input data today and what it might look like in the future, taking the various growth factors into account where necessary.The question of code complexity is the one I'm interested in here. By generalising the solution, we avoid having to rewrite it in the event that the constraints change. However, at the same time it can often result in complicating the code. In the reference question, the code for NxN is easy to understand for any competent programmer, but the NxM case (unless documented well) could easily confuse someone coming across the code for the first time.So, my question is this: Where should you draw the line between generalising and keeping the code easy to understand?",

One of the features I've included is whether the student has received a particular kind of support. What I'd like to do is test whether providing that support to a particular student will result in an improved success rate.In order to test this, I thought I would run through the details of students who haven't received that support to get the baseline score from the model, then run through the same information but flipping the feature indicating that they've received support, and record the new score.Assuming that the support feature is reasonably independent (i.e. it's causing the label, not caused by it - one that I tried to test initially was a contact type that only happened when the students had been absent, so it wasn't appropriate to apply it to other students), is this a valid tactic for evaluating whether we should provide that support to other students in the future?

So if I make a whole application in a closed system and I plan to sell it, I still have to release all my code via OSS license?Let me know if I need to provide more information about my question, thanks.",

    "source": "Capacitated multiple vehicle routing problem with handovers <eos> I'm looking for literature about a variant of the capacitated vehicle/fleet routing problem (a.k.a. VRP, CVRP, etc.) that takes into account the possibility of handovers between multiple vehicles, i.e. the ability to drop off an item from a vehicle and let another one pick it up. Put otherwise, we could say we are allowing an item to be transported (sequentially) by more than one vehicle, e.g.:at time $T^u$ vehicle $V_1$ takes the item from the pick-up location $P^u$ at time $T^d_1 \\geq T^u$ vehicle $V_1$ drops it off at an intermediate point $P_1$at time $T^u_1 \\geq T^d_1$ vehicle $V_2$ picks it up from the intermediate point $P_1$ at time $T^d_2 \\geq T^u_1$ vehicle $V_2$ drops it off at the intermediate point $P_2$ ... at time $T^u_{n-1} \\geq T^d_{n-1}$ vehicle $V_n$ picks it up from intermediate point $P_{n-1}$ at time $T^d \\geq T^u_{n-1}$ vehicle $V_n$ delivers it to the final destination $P^d$.In the VRP overviews I found this variant is not mentioned so I was wondering if anybody knew if it has been investigated at all. note: the term handover is something I came up with to describe the problem: it may not be the one commonly used to denote this kind of variant. The intended meaning, w.r.t. the example above is that e.g. when vehicle $V_1$ drops off the object $O_1$ at $P_1$ and $V_2$ picks it up we could say that $V_1$ hands over object $O_1$ to $V_2$ in $P_1$. update: Reworded to clarify that I'm talking about multiple vehicles (it was just kind-of implicit in the original wording).

GAE is  optimized for many tiny queries and  you get warned if a query takes any  CPU time at all. You get 6.5 (at last  check) free hours per day, but it's a  mystical number and you should test.You'll find that time as you measure  it doesn't relate to the CPU or  datastore CPU time, because (for  example) under the covers there might  be multiple machines updating indexes  during deletes/updates. Some users  have found huge CPU usage when  uploading bulk data - many hours of  usage for e.g. 20 min of real time.Your Java instance might need to be  powered-up if it hasn't been hit in (I  think) 20 minutes. The benefit is that  they can pass their smart management  on to you as cheaper costs, but it  does mean you'll experience a short  delay, and see a high CPU warning on  the first request in a while.For many cases, Python datastore  access is faster than Java JDO. You'll  likely find that using the low-level  API for Java faster.Some developers seem to have  experienced more datastore errors  thank you would expect (around 0.4-1%  maybe?). I haven't yet.I'm wondering what factors go into determining a PaaS's CPU time (like, in this case, the 6.5 hours free that you get with GAE).

So the user adds a field Name, chooses the value type String and fills in the value Arthur. Then the user adds a new field Money, chooses the value type Decimal and fills in the value 10.05.As seen above, the user is able to add any fields with any value types. My idea is to have a SQL table schema as follow:FieldName (varchar) - eg. 'Money' or 'IsAlive'FieldType (varchar) - eg 'Decimal' or 'Boolean'FieldValue (varchar) - eg. '10.5' or '1'This would mean that I can store any pre-defined data type in the table whether it's a string, boolean or long. The problem is that I am not sure it's the best approach to cast those values to string and then cast again when reading from the table.Another option would be to have a column of each type but that sounds even worse.Does my approach to cast everything to string sounds sensible or should I try something else?",

    "source": "Collision Attacks, Message Digests and a Possible solution <eos> I've been doing some preliminary research in the area of message digests. Specifically collision attacks of cryptographic hash functions such as MD5 and SHA-1, such as the Postscript example and X.509 certificate duplicate.From what I can tell in the case of the postscript attack, specific data was generated and embedded within the header of the postscript (which is ignored during rendering) which brought about the internal state of the md5 to a state such that the modified wording of the document would lead to a final MD equivalent to the original. The X.509 took a similar approach where by data was injected within the comment/whitespace of the certificate.Ok so here is my question, and I can't seem to find anyone asking this question:Why isn't the length of ONLY the data being consumed added as a final block to the MD calculation?In the case of X.509 - Why is the whitespace and comments being taken into account as part of the MD?Wouldn't a simple processes such as one of the following be enough to resolve the proposed collision attacks:$MD(M + |M|) = xyz$$MD(M + |M| + |M| * magicseed_0 +...+ |M| * magicseed_n) = xyz$where :M : is the message|M| : size of the message in bitsMD : is the message digest function (eg: md5, sha, whirlpool etc)xyz : is the pairing of the acutal message digest value for the message M and |M|. <M,|M|>$magicseed_{i}$: Is a set of random values generated with seed based on the internal-state prior to the size being added.'+' : is a concatentation operation A+B+C = ABCThis technqiue should work, as to date all such collision attacks rely on adding more data to the original message.In short, the level of difficulty involved in generating a collision message such that:It not only generates the same MDBut is also comprehensible/parsible/compliantand is also the same size as the original message,is immensely difficult if not near impossible. Has this approach ever been discussed? Any links to papers etc would be nice.Further Question: What is the lower bound for collisions of messages of common length for a hash function H chosen randomly from U, where U is the set of universal hash functions ?Is it $1/N$ (where N is $2^{|M|}$) or is it greater? If it is greater, that implies there is more than 1 message of length |M| that will map to the same MD value for a given H.If that is the case, how practical is it to find these other messages? bruteforce would be of $O(2^N)$, is there a method of time complexity less than bruteforce?Links:Postscript: http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/06/more_md5_collis.htmlX.509: http://www.win.tue.nl/~bdeweger/CollidingCertificates/Note: This question is NOT as easy as it seems.

I think that each variable part of a user story can be improved by following certain guidelines.1. RoleDefining possible roles may be the easiest part. The only problem is that user stories usually  just describe functional features that need development.Do you write non-functional stories? And I'm not thinking about technical stories that are related to other aspects of product planning like administrative things. I'm more thinking of additional supporting stories that support the same high-level goal. Like advertising related stories that are related to features?2. FeatureDefining features seems to be easy but it turns out it's not. Because I can see stories that are heavily related so certain roles can't be developed until others are finished. Example: User registration is a pillar user story that needs to be done first in order to develop other user stories that are related to registered user roles (logged in users and/or admins etc.). This one is very obvious but sometimes relationships are much more subtle.How do you avoid relationships between user stories? Is there a technique to break related stories apart so we can have better development parallelism? Breaking relationships also helps better sprint cycles because one story can't stall the whole sprint.3. BenefitThis one is the hardest part that I think I have least knowledge how to write good user stories with clear benefits.Do you actually write benefits per story or do you rather provide high level goals instead? Providing these instead of benefits makes it easy to see why certain user story is more important than the other? So it helps prioritisation.Is it wise to have shared benefits/goals between set of user stories?Do you write user stories without benefits part? Is that wise and what do you do instead?Do you write benefits in a way so they can be measurable? Can we do that and is it beneficial?4. User stories as a wholeHave you ever defined all user stories as epics? This would help filter out/prioritise those that give more to the common goals.

Currently I am a little bit confused about enumerators that are based on ATL collections. I already wrote several enumerators based on STL collections, but since there is no ICollectionOnATL-interface (such as the ICollectionOnSTL-interface), I am a little bit confused if my implementation is correct.Here is how I am creating the enumerator at the moment:STDMETHODIMP CCollectionOnATL::get_NewEnum(IEnumITEM** enumerator){    // IItem implements IUnknown.    typedef CInterfaceArray<IItem> Container;    typedef CComEnum<IEnumITEM, &IID_IEnumITEM, IItem*, _CopyInterface<IItem>> CComEnumITEM;    // Copy all elements to an array that can be enumerated.    Container items;     auto elements = m_coll.GetCount();    //items.SetCount(elements);    // See below for the definition of m_coll.    POSITION pos = m_coll.GetHeadPosition();    for (size_t element = 0; element < elements; element++)    {        auto current = m_coll.GetNext(pos);        // Automatically calls AddRef!        items.Add(current->m_value);    }    // Create an enumerator over the array.    // Using `new` is valid here (since enumerators do not implement FinalConstruct).    CComObject<CComEnumITEM>* pEnum = new CComObject<CComEnumITEM>();    pEnum->Init(&items[0], &items[elements - 1], nullptr, ATL::AtlFlagTakeOwnership);    // Return the enumerator.    return pEnum->QueryInterface(enumerator);}The member m_coll is defined as CRBMap:CRBMap<ULONG, IItem*> m_coll;There are some points with this implementation, where I am not really sure if I understood them correctly:Iterating the CRBMap should give me an ordered list, where the lowest key is the first and the highest key is the last element. However, I am not sure if there's a better (in terms of simplicity) way to perform the iteration.Usage of CInterfaceArray to initialize the enumerator:pEnum->Init(&items[0], &items[elements - 1], nullptr, ATL::AtlFlagTakeOwnership);Is the initialization correct? Especially I am wondering about the third parameter, that references an IUnknown-instance to keep alive for as long as the enumerator lives. Currently I am passing nullptr, but I think the right value should be the items-array, which however does not implement IUnknown.Regarding the enumerator initialization: Was my choose of ATL::AtlFlagTakeOwnership correct in here? I am not completely sure, because the actual ownership of the instances is taken by m_coll.Since the size of the final array is known, I could initialize it (and therefor prevent relocations/copy-steps) using items.SetCount(elements);. However, the MSDN only states that CInterfaceArray::Add automatically calls AddRef. There's no information about SetAt or operator[]. Could I simply change the way I add items to the array to items[element] = current->m_value; without any change in the behaviour of reference counting?Also if you have any suggestions on how I can further improve this code, please let me know!",

Something tells me that you need to separate your business profile for the profiles of the founders, each 1 has their own presence.I also read in a book that you need to be intimate as possible - when reaching out to people (for example in forums) that you need respond as a person, and not a business.

present on the board. It also handles revertion of board. There is a list for each kind of piece (promoted pieces count as kind of piece for this) for each player. Doing it like this (instead of a global list for all pieces with a parameter to determine the kind of piece) allows me to make loops to iterate only over certain kind of piece. Another secondary function of coords_manager is to provide dictionaries to translate human-readable coords in numeric coords to blit the sprites. Every list of pieces gets the coords in numeric version.Kinds of pieces are abbreviated this way:s -> if present, it would mean promoted piecep -> english abbreviature for the kind of piece - pawn in this casen -> player's color (n if 'black' or 'sente', b if 'white' or 'gote')When I noticed that I needed a way to prevent pieces jumping over other pieces, I created matrix_manager to resolve the problem. It basically handles a matrix of boolean values to keep in account which squares are filled by a piece.The point I'm trying to make is that I want to make a Move class to clean up the code to prevent abuse of exec statements and regexp matching, as pointed in my previous question. But I'm convinced that, before doing such a thing, I should improve the managers first, as @200_success suggested me in the previous question.Which ways would you try to improve the board managers? Should I join those classes into a single one for a better modelling? Which deficiencies or redundancies am I not noticing in these managers?I started this project at first just because I wanted a way to read my shogi notations. When the basic functionality worked, I decided to make the code public under GPL license for sharing, and with the hope that some entusiasts would join me to suggest improvements or even to work on the code if they felt willing to. So, you will find extensive general information in the README section in GitHub. Any little contribution is highly appreciated.",

I've come across an algorithm called quick find. The course does have reference to Big O Notation. Despite the fact that I do not have much knowledge of Big O, I have been doing some basic reading.Implementation (Java):Initializes the array:public QuickFindUF(int N){    id = new int[N];    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)    id[i] = i;}Checks if two input values are connected:public boolean connected(int p, int q){     return id[p] == id[q];}Union Implementation:public void union(int p, int q){    int pid = id[p];    int qid = id[q];    for (int i = 0; i < id.length; i++)    {        if (id[i] == pid)        {            id[i] = qid;        }    }}The id variable is a private instance variable.My Problem:1) In the study material it says:It takes N2 array accesses to process a sequence of N union  commands on N objectsHow can it take N2 if the union method only has a single for loop?2) It also says that the union method takes at most 2N + 2 array accessesWhat does this mean? My speculation is that 2N could mean that the array is accessed twice (line 7 and line 9 of the union method). I have no idea what + 2 refers to though.I apologize if I have incorrectly stated something.Any help would be highly appreciated. Thank You.",

    "source": "ASP.NET MVC create a draft without persisting to DB <eos> I have a requirement to allow users to suggest updates to their profiles on a site I'm working. They would be able to view their profile details, then click on and edit button, which would basically make a copy of all their data contained in a handful of one-to-many related DB tables. They can then add or remove items and update various text fields before saving the draft. Upon saving, an administrator would have to approve this change before the new data is actually published onto the live site.I currently have an identical set of tables for live data and drafts (and history, but that's not important). My difficulty is that the client doesn't want an actual draft entry created in the drafts db structure until the user has hit save. A user would be able to perform CRUD operations against all the data, including uploading new images, but I am not allowed to touch the DB unless they're ready to commit these updates.My great problem is that I have no idea how to begin developing what seems to the client to be a very simple thing, even though it's technically quite challenging. I also can't seem to make the client understand that hitting the Cancel button next to the save button would remove the entry plus all its related data from the DB, making the problem moot in my humble opinion.So, the question is such: is there a way to phrase my objection in such a way that the client can understand what I'm getting at. Or failing that, what would be a good way of developing such a session-stored object?",

It's more difficult to figure out how you'd exit the loop, and could invite bugs as the breaking condition might be bypassed or omitted accidentally given future changes.Now, the code could be structured as follows:public void doSomething(int input){   TransformInSomeWay(input);   while(!ProcessingComplete(input))   {      DoSomethingElseTo(input);      TransformInSomeWay(input);   }}However, this duplicates a call to a method in code, violating DRY; if TransformInSomeWay were later replaced with some other method, both calls would have to be found and changed (and the fact that there are two may be less obvious in a more complex piece of code).You could also write it like:public void doSomething(int input){   var complete = false;   while(!complete)   {      TransformInSomeWay(input);      complete = ProcessingComplete(input);      if(!complete)       {         DoSomethingElseTo(input);                }   }}... but you now have a variable whose only purpose is to shift the condition-checking to the loop structure, and also has to be checked multiple times to provide the same behavior as the original logic.For my part, I say that given the algorithm this code implements in the real world, the original code is the most readable. If you were going through it yourself, this is the way you'd think about it, and so it would be intuitive to people familiar with the algorithm.So, which is better? is it better to give the responsibility of condition checking to the while loop by structuring the logic around the loop? Or is it better to structure the logic in a natural way as indicated by requirements or a conceptual description of the algorithm, even though that may mean bypassing the loop's built-in capabilities?",

He may argue that I am not checking for i, but I see no point of storing i if we are not using it later.In addition, if he argues that I am not checking for and storing i, that would mean that if I did store them, I would explicitly have to go exclude the i from the string when I perform mathematical operations on the numbers.

First we assume that the array $A$ contains at least 3 elements (if less then the proof is trivial). The element which appears more than $n/2$ times is $M$ else it's $M'$. Let a two-element combination of $MM'$ or $M'M$ be called $C$. Every time we traverse a $C$ the count decreases by one. CASE 1: If the pattern is strictly alternating combinations of type $C$  then the first and the last element must be $M$ (otherwise $M$ will not appear more than $n/2$ times) and this means that after the last iteration the candidate is $M$.CASE 2: We can see that after any number of adjacent $C$'s the counter will be $0$ and the candidate will be either $M$ or $M'$. It is given that more than $n/2$ elements of $M$ do exist in the array, so the number of $C$ combinations must be supplemented by at least $1$ occurrence of $k$ adjacent elements of $M$ either before $C$'s or after $C$'s. If it's after, then the next candidate is $M$ and it will continue to be so as long as we keep traversing $k$ elements of adjacent $M$'s. If it's before than the count will be at least $1$ before it proceeds to iterate through $C$'s and essentially it'll behave just like CASE 1.I'm still aware that the proof is not perfect but I feel like it's an improvement.

    "source": "Data structures for ordering noisy data <eos> In a certain robotics application, I encountered a problem in which we need to determine the order of positions of several robots on $\\mathbb{R}$. Each measurement that we take of robot positions is subject to random errors beyond our control. I've formalised the algorithmic part of the problem as follows. This part has been reformulated as per D.W.'s comments.The positions of $n$ robots are given to us in a $3\\times n$ array, each row being of the form $[i, A, \\epsilon]$.This row states   that the position of the robot with id $i$ is uniformly distributed on the interval $A \\pm \\epsilon$.Problem : Output the most probable ordering (MPO) of the robot positions,or one such if this is non-unique.Example Input: $\\begin{bmatrix} \\mathrm{id} & A & \\epsilon \\\\ \\hline  1 & 1& 0.5 \\\\ 2& 1.5 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$. Associate the two robot positions with random variables $X_1$ and $X_2$. Note that the pair $(X_1,X_2)$ is uniform on the rectangle $[0.5,1.5] \\times [-0.5,3.5]$.  The probability $p_1$ (resp. $p_2$) that $X_1\\leq X_2$ (resp. $X_1 \\geq X_2$) is the area of this rectangle below (resp. above) the line $x_1\\leq x_2$. If $p_1 \\leq p_2$, then the MPO is $[1,2]$ , else $[2,1]$. What data structure efficiently computes the MPO? I'm most interested in the range $n\\in [10,1000]$.Simple idea that doesn't work (thanks to D.W.): When $n\\geq 3$, the MPO isn't equal to the sorted order of the means $A_i$. For example, the input $(1, 0.4\\pm0), (2,0.5\\pm 0.5), (3,0.7 \\pm 0)$ has the MPO $[2,1,3]$ and not $[1,2,3]$ as the $A$'s would have us think. One possible approach uses the Sweep Line algorithm. Think of a robot position as a rectangle corresponding to its uniform pdf. Compute all intersecting rectangles using the Priority Queue of the sweep line, and reorder them as per the probability calculation above. (It may be possible to reduce the $O(n^2)$ pairwise comparison of probabilities to $O(n \\log n)$; I haven't checked this though.) Non-overlapping rectangles leave their ordering intact.Intuitively, large error bounds lead to long rectangles and potentially more overlaps, consequently increasing the running time. Likewise, small error bounds cause few overlaps, speeding up computations. This fact will be reflected in the sweep line.",

Or is there anything else I could try to at least get the stick recognised on the BeagleBone?(I'm aware that I will have to compile the necessary kernel module myself, just like on the Raspberry Pi, but that's no use if the stick isn't even recognised...)EditI've checked the supply voltage on the USB port and it is actually switched off the moment I connect the WiFi stick. I tried forcing it back on by pulling the !EN pin on the TPS2051 switch IC low, but that didn't help (i.e. the voltage came back on, but the system didn't seem to poll the bus anymore).I've googled for the USB1_DRVVBUS output on the processor that drives the input of the switch IC and it seems that the supply for the USB host port is automatically disabled when an over-current condition is detected.That explains why the stick crahes the Raspberry Pi and fails to work on the BeagleBone, but leaves me to wonder if it might be broken, since several Raspberry users have reported that it worked for them without a powered hub.Second EditI perused the schematic some more and bypassed the switch IC and current sensing resistor, but even then the the USB host section is disabled as soon as the WiFi stick is connected.",

(By app user or support desk technician)We can prove it is application developers' fault if they blame it to us.Some issues may only happen in production that cannot be reproduce on test environment.Log files are not big anyway. A small log file that use some of the device storage shouldn't be an issue.All servers application/API always have logs.Reverse engineer is always possible via decompile, so it shouldn't really matters.Reasons to not have logs:Framework doesn't own the application. Most users have no idea how to get the log files out of application's storage (hence less likely to be able to get it), so don't add something that will not be usedApplication developer should be able to pinpoint the problem by their own logs/debug method before coming to usRisk of exposing too much information to end users.No other frameworks seems to do it (e.g. Facebook SDK/Google SDK)Taking up device storage. Every byte count.It is the responsible of the framework user (developer) to have their own logs/crash reporting if they want to.Debug version with console/debugger logs should be enough for developers.So basically we are not able to get into an agreement.

However, the unweighted version of this problem is given by:$$\\max \\sum_{i}^nx_i$$$$\\text{s.t.} \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i\\leqslant W,\\quad(P)$$$$x_i\\in\\{0,1\\}.$$is not NP-hard since the optimal solution is to sort the items in the ascending order with respect to $p_i$ and start filling the bag until the capacity $W$ is reached.The problem is the following: I used the unweighted version of this problem as a special case of the weighted version and I showed that unweighted is an NP-hard problem. What is my mistake? Here is my steps: I will reduce $(WP)$ to $(P)$ in polynomial time. So, an instance of $(P)$ is constructed easily by taking $w_i=1$.

Here are my .bashrc, .bash_profile and PATH$ cat .bashrc   #   # ~/.bashrc   #   # If not running interactively, don't do anything   [[ $- != *i* ]] && return$ cat .bash_profile   #   # ~/.bash_profile   #   [[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] && . ~/.bashrc   alias ls='ls --color=auto'   PS1='[\\u@\\h \\W]\\$ '$ echo $PATH   /usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/site_perl:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perlAddition 1: As @terdon suggest, I run$ grep -FH '\\#' ~/.bashrc ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile ~/bash.login ~/.bash_aliases /etc/bash.bashrc /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/* /etc/environment 2>/dev/nulland receive nothing.

    "source": "Handling null-references in C# logic <eos> Let's say I have an API method with can be used to calculate the sum of all orders made by a specific customer:Amount CalculateOrderSum(int customerId){    // Perform authentication to make sure caller has access to customerId    // Retrieve customer with id customerId    // Retrieve all orders related to the customer    // Retrieve details for different orders (not always, depending on state)}At any point in this function, some system administrator may purge old items from the system. This means that one of the below can happen while the method above is running:The authentication will fail, because the customer no longer existsThe customer can't be loaded, since it was deletedThe customer can be loaded, but a millisecond later the orders are deleted and cannot be retrieved.Retrieving order details works for some orders, but fails for others since they have been deleted mid-processing.I want the application to return a friendly error message when any of this happens, rather than returning a NullReferenceException or similar.As I see it, there's some different approaches to add error-handling for this logic:I could introduce a lot of null-checks throughout the code for example: if (customer != null) throw OrderRetrievalFailedException(customer is a goner.). Since all the data in the database can be purged at any time, this would lead to quite a lot of if's spread throughout the code (which seems to get messy)I could change the purging functionality to mark customers or orders as deleted (rather than actually removing the database rows). This way the function could still do its work because the data will still be there. The issue here is that we actually want to purge old data for different reasons (less attack surface and performance considerations for example).I could change all methods to throw if an object can't be loaded (so GetOrders(customerId) could throw CustomerNotFoundException if the customer cannot be loaded) which would be catched in the CalculateOrderSum function and an error given to the user. So basically the code would have to be littered with if (something == null) throw new SomeException.I could introduce some global locking mechanism, so that a customer can't be deleted while any one is reading any of its data. The issue here is that our system is distributed so we would need to implement a central locking mechanism. Also, I have a bad experience with locking of database rows in use-cases like this in high-traffic database.All of these approaches feels quite convoluted and tricky to get right to me, and it means that the main success flow of the code will be littered with handling of exception scenarios. I'm leaning towards alternative 3, but I would to hear if there's some other standard and robust way of handling this.(I'm using C#, but I assume that the same issue would apply to users of for example Java or C++)",

Of course, I knew that auto_ptr was deprecated in C++0x, but...Isn't deprecation a waste of time and effort? Reasons for not deprecating (with auto_ptr as an example):there is an ocean of code out there that still needs to be supported, producing millions of warnings will only tempt people to turn warnings off.auto_ptr is a bit naff, but it does actually do what it says on the tin.if we really want to deprecate things, I nominate printf(). But just imagine the squeals that would ensue. auto_ptr doesn't have too many friends, but in at least my C++ code it is used more than printf, which isn't used at all.the committee have a bad record of getting this right - they deprecated static at namespace scope, and now it seems to have been undeprecated  - I wouldn't be surprised if auto_ptr made a similar come-backlastly, whatever the committee say, the compiler implementers ignore them - they simply can't risk breaking their customers code, all they can do is issue irritating warnings.So my question - do you consider deprecation (of anything, not just auto_ptrs, and not just in C++) a good idea, and if so, why?",

In my specific case, I want to get tty number in tmate session. So which tty does pts running on? In the case above tmate is started on teamviewer session. so I type tty get /dev/pts/1 and then I exit tmate session by typing exit and back to teamviewer session and type tty again get /dev/tty6. It seems means that /dev/pts/1 working on /dev/tty6. And I want to get tty6 in tmate session without exit to the session. It should nothing related to tmate and teamviewer. It should same when ssh to a physic machine. So there should a solution to get tty number back in pty.Manay solutions how-to-get-the-tty-in-which-bash-is-running, returns the filename of the terminal connected to standard input, get-current-terminal-name only get pty number.

The whole thing works very well, but building an actual application with it is hard, since eyetracking is done by polling for new data.Polling becomes a problem as soon as you have a graphical user interface, as a poll-loop blocks the main event loop, freezing the gui. This also makes it impossible to stop the polling loop through user input.My goal is to build a polling service that is generic enough to be used for a lot of different applications. It has to be asynchronous and has to have some kind of callback mechanism to use any relevant data.This is my idea (pseudocode):PollService {  // The filterFunction decides if a eyetracking event is relevant or can be ignored  setFilterFunction(filterFunction);  // The callbackFunction is executed if a relevant eyetracking event is polled  setCallbackFunction(callbackFunction);  start();  stop();}The PollService itself only manages the asynchronous polling process. It is supplied a couple of functions to perform the two basic steps:Filter if a eyetracking event is relevant, skip event if notPerform some kind of operation on any event that is relevantPossible callback operations might be:Perform a long running computation with the eyetracking event dataPrint something to the screenStore something to a databaseCommunicate the event to another thread (using a messaging queue for example)Update a GUI (using Platform.runLater() for example)The filterFunction and callbackFunction would be implemented as functional interfaces, so Java 8 users can easily supply these functions using lambdas or method references.What do you think about this design? Are there any obvious flaws i am not seeing?",

It's all ASP.NET but we're not in the cloud. I'm trying to find a way of streamlining environments to reduce complexity.Simplified view, let's say there are 3 systems in production: A,B,C. They communicate like this:Prod: A 1.0 => B 1.0 => C 1.0We mirror that in a test environment like this:Test: A 1.0 => B 1.0 => C 1.0If there's an urgent production bug in B, we would make a fix to B and deploy it to the test environment. Test: A 1.0 => B 1.1 => C 1.0and if integration tests pass we can release it to production:Prod: A 1.0 => B 1.1 => C 1.0Now let's say we develop a new feature which means A and B both need to change. Both A and B are being deployed to test.Test: A 2.0 => B 2.0 => C 1.0During this development period, if an urgent production bug is found in B, we would have to make a fix to B and deploy it to test environment:Test: A 2.0 => B 1.2 => C 1.0Obviously this is shaky ground now because the test environment does not resemble production. And what about when B 2.0 has a breaking change - in this case the A 2.0 will fail when pointing to B 1.2.So what we've done is create another environment for emergency fixes, called Patch. So we can have:Test: A 2.0 => B 2.0 => C 1.0Patch: A 1.0 => B 1.2 => C 1.0Now A, B and C each have different delivery cycles, so what tends to happen is that at different stages of the project, the Patch environment is abused in order to test different versions of each component for the current release or for the next release. We end up doing crazy stuff like pointing Test A to Patch B, or pointing Patch B to Test C. And this obviously generates huge confusion. Not to mention that this is a massively simplified version, in reality we have at least 8 systems involved here, with 6 environments. The TeamCity summary page is like spaghetti junction. Also some environments talk to each other (in my example above it would be like A => B => C => A).Please help me understand how this type of scenario can work.",

I was absent for 12 days.What do we have now (the project was developed by 4 other members of the team):3 different coding styles all over the project (I guess, two of them agreed to use the same style :), same applies to the naming of our abstractions (e.g CommonPathData.h, SubwaySchemeStructures.h), which are basically headers declaring some data structures.Absolute lack of documentation for the recently implemented parts.What I could recently call a single-purpose-abstraction now handles at least 2 different types of events, has tight coupling with other parts and so on.Half of the used interfaces now contain member variables (sic!).Raw pointer usage almost everywhere.Unit tests disabled, because (Rev.57) They are unnecessary for this project.... (that's probably not everything).Commit history shows that my design was interpreted as an overkill and people started combining it with personal bicycles and reimplemented wheels and then had problems integrating code chunks.Now - the project still does only a small amount of what it has to do, we have severe integration problems, I assume some memory leaks.Is there anything possible to do in this case?I do realize that all my efforts didn't have any benefit, but the deadline is pretty soon and we have to do something. Did someone have a similar situation?Basically I thought that a good (well, I did everything that I could) start for the project would probably lead to something nice, however, I understand that I'm wrong.",

Users logging into the SFTP server are authenticated against AD database, and everything works great: for each user logging in and accessing the mounted/shared folder, the multiuser+krb5 settings kick in and folder permissions are fully controlled by the Windows File Server holding the files, since each user mounts this share using their own kerberos ticket obtained upon logon to the SFTP server.Great. Now onto the sad part of the story.I have to provide HTTPS access to the same files mentioned above. The problem is that I couldn't find a way to make Apache/httpd access files using the authenticated user's credentials, which would cause the share to be mounted with the right (requesting user's) credentials, instead of Apache's user.I could work around this by setting mod ldap's group authorization, but I REALLY wanted to control everything using Windows' permissions, just as I do with SFTP access. Any ideas aside from using IIS (which does exactly what I want by default)?I can already use Single Sign-On through Apache, and even cache the kerberos tickets. So what's stopping me (aside from my lack of programming skills) from using that same ticket (and username info) to call automount with it?",

    "source": "Are if statements unnecessary if a program is represented as an explicit state machine? <eos> This question occurred to me some time ago when I was thinking about whether or not if statements are fundamental in computation.Consider a program that manages a single bank account (for the sake of simplicity). The bank account could be defined as something likeAccount {    int balance; // current amount of Money    boolean withdraw(int n)    {       if (balance >= n)       {           balance = balance -n;           return true;       }       else           return false;    }    void deposit(int n)    {       amount = amount + n;    }}Since the program has no way to known in which state it currently is unless it performs validations using if statements, as in the withdraw operation, if statements are unavoidable.However, over the course of time, the program will pass through a finite set of states that can be known beforehand. In this particular case, a state is defined solely by the value of the balance variable, hence we would have states: {balance = 0 , balance = 1, balance = 2...}.If we assign each state a number, say state {0,1,2,....} with a 1-1 correspondence to the above set of states, and assign to each operation a number identifier as well (say deposit = 0 and withdraw = 1), we could model the program as an explicit transition between states and therefore remove every if statement from the code.Consider that state = 0 is the state where balance = 0 and we want to perform a deposit of 50 dollars, if we coded every single possible execution of the deposit function, we could just define the deposit function asvoid deposit (int n){   deposit[state][n]; // ndex deposit instance for state = 0, amount = n;}deposit[][] would be a matrix of pointers for a set of functions that represent each possible execution of deposit, likedeposit[0][0] -> balance = balance + 0; state = 0;deposit[0][1] -> balance = balance + 1; state = 1;....In the case of withdrawal, it would be like:boolean withdraw (int n){    // ndex withdraw instance for the current state and amount=n    return withdraw[state][n]; }withdraw[][] would be a matrix of pointers for a set of functions that represent each possible execution of withdraw, like:deposit[0][100] -> return false; state = state;...deposit[200][100] -> balance = balance - 100; return true; state = 100;In this situation, the program the managers the single bank account can be written without using a single if statement!As a consequence however, we have to use A LOT more memory, which may make the solution unreasonable. Also one may put the question of how did we fill the deposit[][] and withdraw[][] matrices? By hand? It somehow implies that a previous computation that used ifs as necessary to determine and possible states and transitions.All in all, are ifs fundamental or does my example prove that they aren't? If they are, can you provide me an example where this does not work? If they are not, why dont we use solutions like these more often?Is there some law of computation which states that if statements are unavoidable?",
