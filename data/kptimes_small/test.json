    "source": "World records no joke to frustrated Pakistanis <eos> ISLAMABAD - One young contender created the world’s largest sequin mosaic using 325,000 of the sparkly discs. Two other youths achieved 123 consecutive badminton passes in one minute. And 1,450 participants broke the record for the most people arm wrestling. Such are the skills that Guinness World Records are made of in Pakistan, where thousands of young people are groomed to establish their unique feats for posterity. Last week, the contestants came together for the annual Punjab Youth Festival to show their stuff — many in athletics, but others in downright quirky displays, including one young boy who achieved fame by kicking 50 coconuts from on top of the heads of a row of people. It seems Pakistan has become a world record-creating machine, with the coordinated effort reaping an impressive 23 world records, event organizers boasted. The push for inclusion of Pakistanis in the venerable Guinness World Records entries (which began in book form in 1955) stems in part from festival organizers’ desire to boost the image of a country often associated with militancy, religious strife and economic decline. There is a patriotic element, as well: Last October, for instance, 42,813 Pakistanis got together in a Lahore hockey stadium to belt out the national anthem and create yet another world record for the most people singing their country’s anthem. Days later, another 24,200 people held green and white boxes — the colors of the national flag of Pakistan — to set the world record for creating the largest human flag. Although some of the records might seem amusing to others — coconut kicking champ Mohammad Rashid of Karachi last week claimed his fourth world record by breaking 34 pine boards in 32 seconds with his head — the competitions were no laughing matter to participants. Usman Anwar, director of the Punjab Youth Festival, explained that the kids have been training for eight months. “We started at the neighborhood and village level so that children could come out and participate,” said Anwar. “Our main objective was to inculcate interest for sports in the public.” Young people from over 55,000 neighborhood and village councils vied for a chance to compete in the games. “We were able to select the best of the best to train for the world records,” said Anwar. Because of terrorism, political upheaval and widespread unemployment, many young people appear to have little hope for the future, says Hafeez Rehman, a professor in the anthropology department at Quaid-i-Azam University in the capital, Islamabad. Sports competitions, Rehman said, create an opportunity for youth to excel personally and also to improve Pakistan’s image. “We have energetic youth. Pakistan has more than 55 million young people. It becomes an asset for the country,” he added. The festival itself has become part of the record-setting mania. It was recognized for having more participants — 3.3 million, most of whom registered online, according to Anwar — constituting a world record for sporting events.",

I was lucky to enter as press; otherwise, visitors must be affiliated with the food industry — and pay ¥5,000 — to enter. The FoodEx menu is global, including everything from cherry beer from Germany and premium Mexican tequila to top-class French and Chinese dumplings. The event was a rare chance to try out both well-known and exotic foods and even see professionals making them. In addition to booths offering traditional Japanese favorites such as udon and maguro sashimi, there were plenty of innovative twists, such as dorayaki , a sweet snack made of two pancakes and a red-bean filling, that came in coffee and tomato flavors.

    "source": "'Abenomists' beware: Rising prices just one pitfall of spiraling yen <eos> The Bank of Japan on Wednesday installed a new governor and two deputy governors who — in line with the wishes of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe — are advocates of ultra-easy monetary policy. Attention is now focused on what specific policy actions the new central bank team will take. But while benefits, including a weaker yen and rising share prices, have materialized in anticipation of further easing, drawbacks are also starting to emerge — most notably in the form of rising prices. In a sign that a mini bubble may be at hand, condominiums in suburban Tokyo are being marketed for nearly ¥100 million per unit. Some may argue that rising prices are just part of the journey needed to end deflation. But while automakers may be offering higher bonuses to offset the rise in household expenses, employees at small and midsize companies who cannot harbor the same expectations as their bigger counterparts are going to suffer right along with those depending on pension benefits. Instead of simply raising salaries to reflect the benefits that the weak yen is bringing to their exports, automakers should try to pass along those benefits to their subcontractors — the same people they demanded price cuts from during the tough times when the currency was ascending — so the benefits of the yen’s fall can spread to wider segments of the economy. The yen was trading at ¥81.10 to the dollar when the Lower House was dissolved for the general election on Nov. 16, 2012. It has since fallen by about 20 percent, sending prices for imports, which until October had fallen for six consecutive months year on year, soaring. Import prices rose 13.2 percent in February alone. We need to realize that the falling yen is bringing both benefits — in the form of higher exports — and drawbacks, in the form of a higher cost of living. It is therefore essential that the pros and cons be weighed and compared. For households, which can’t realistically hope for substantial wage gains due to tough competition from overseas labor, the lower import prices caused by the strong yen were a blessing that strengthened their purchasing power. In macroeconomic terms, private-sector consumption and imports combined outweighed the value of exports. Failing to pay sufficient attention to the drawbacks of the yen’s fall might turn out to be the pitfall of “Abenomics.” It has to be noted that a weaker yen will also further worsen Japan’s trade balance. This is primarily because 61.6 percent of the nation’s export transactions and 77.1 percent of its import transactions were carried out in foreign currencies, according to Finance Ministry data as of January. The weaker the yen gets, the more Japan’s foreign currency-denominated trade deficits will continue to grow, prompting further outflows of Japanese income overseas. The high share of foreign currency-denominated transactions in Japan’s imports is mainly because international commodities, such as crude oil and wheat, are traded in dollars. Japanese demand in such products is reflected in international prices via the dollar. Commodity trade inside Japan is of course carried out in yen, but it has little international impact because foreign participation is so low. This situation must be quickly rectified. Other things needing rectification are the deep-rooted beliefs within the business community, especially among stockbrokers, that a lower yen automatically translates into higher share prices, or that a weak yen is good and a strong yen is bad. Right after Japan lost World War II, there was a time when we were unable to use yen to buy goods from overseas because the nation’s credibility was at rock bottom. It was crucial for Japan to accumulate dollars, which would be gladly accepted by anybody. When I landed my first job in 1956, Japan’s foreign currency reserves stood at roughly $2 billion. Earlier, they had dropped so sharply Japan could only pay for only three months’ worth of imports; they later grew to about $2 billion, thanks to special demand related to the Korean War. It was conditions like these in the postwar era that helped form Japan’s export-oriented policies and belief in the weak yen. Today, having undergone full economic development, Japan is awash in foreign currency reserves. In fact, a much of them have gone stale in the sense that the value of the dollar has shrunk from ¥360 in the early 1970s to around ¥90 now. While many people continue to believe in the benefits of a weak yen, they need to realize that under Japan’s current trade structure, its deficits increase the lower the yen drops against other currencies. What is needed is a change in mindset to the idea that both trade and overseas investment must be conducted on a yen-denominated basis. If import and export transactions are carried out in yen, there will be no need for Japan to worry about every little up and down in the exchange rates. Japan’s bid to drive the yen lower was one of the hot behind-the-scenes issues at the G-7 and G-20 meetings in Moscow in February. The G-20 statement issued on Feb. 16 made it clear that a currency depreciation war, in which countries compete to drive their own currencies lower, needs to be avoided, noting that the objective of monetary policy should be to improve economic growth. Such reactions seem natural, given that Abenomics will purportedly put an end to deflation and the strong yen. No such suspicions would emerge if Japan conducted all its trade in yen. It is essential for the government to recognize, in a balanced manner, the positive and negative effects of both a strong yen and a weak yen, and to flesh out Abenomics with concrete actions that can promote economic growth.",

Last year, the Street Views team traveled to Fukushima’s Namie-machi, making it possible for everyone to experience Japan’s no-go zone. Straying from the usual Street View approach, the Google team actually went inside a building for this expedition. One of them is Ukedo Elementary School, and the images of its abandoned school rooms are heartbreaking. Namie-machi was evacuated right after the explosion of the Fukushima No. 1 power plant. The location, which suffered heavy damage from the 3/11 earthquake and tsunami, is now a ghost town. Fortunately, all 77 students Ukedo Elementary school, located 500 meters from the coastline of Fukushima, were evacuated safely. Messages, probably written by students or teachers before leaving the area, can be seen written on the school’s whiteboard.

    "source": "The 5 p.m. bell <eos> Dear Alice, I live in a medium-size city in Saitama Prefecture and am puzzled by a speaker system mounted on a huge pole right outside my apartment. Every evening at 5 p.m., music plays from the speakers for 20 or 30 seconds and then stops. It’s the same song every day, which I don’t recognize, and it’s really, really loud. Occasionally, there is also a public announcement from the speakers. Even if my Japanese was up to the challenge, which it’s not, I doubt I’d understand what they are saying because the sound quality is pretty bad. But it’s the music that’s really got me wondering because it comes at the same time every day, like clockwork. My Japanese coworker told me it’s so children know it’s time to stop playing and go home, but all the kids I know go to cram school and don’t head home until well after dark. So, what the heck is that music? Belinda, Saitama Prefecture Dear Belinda, What you’re hearing is colloquially referred to as the goji no chaimu (the 5 p.m. bell) but the proper term is more of a mouthful: shichōson bōsai gyōsei musen hōsō (local government disaster administration wireless broadcast), or bōsai musen (disaster wireless) for short. That naming alone should tip you off that there’s more to the music than your coworker seemed to realize. Your little evening concert is actually a daily test of an emergency broadcast system to alert citizens of dangers such as tsunamis and industrial accidents. More than 90 percent of cities, towns and villages in Japan have similar systems, but the timing of the daily test varies as does the music played. Many jurisdictions have one daily test at noon, for example, or run test broadcasts twice a day, at, say, noon and 6 p.m. in the evening. The thinking is that as long as there’s going to be a daily test, it may as well be timed so it serves some other purpose, and reminding kids to head home before dark is a popular one. In many localities the evening broadcast is timed to 5 p.m. in the winter months and 5:30 p.m. or 6 p.m. as the days get longer. The horn-shaped speakers may look low-tech, but in fact they are linked to a national system that can transmit warnings to local governments throughout the country in as little as seven seconds. The nationwide disaster-warning network was launched about 50 years ago, following a major earthquake in Niigata Prefecture in 1964, and has received changes and improvements over the years. The current focus is on upgrading equipment to newer digital systems. To find out more, I paid a visit to the headquarters of Fujitsu General, one of the largest manufacturers of bōsai musen systems. Sales director Tadashi Maekawa explained that the latest digital systems can do a great deal more than simply send broadcasts to speakers like the ones outside your apartment. They can also transmit simultaneous alerts to mobile phones, fax machines and devices for the hearing-impaired; insert messages into radio and television broadcasts, and even automatically post information on the local government’s Web page. Local systems can also be linked to the central government’s satellite-based J-Alert system, which was launched in 2007 to directly inform the public of various threats, including the launch of missiles by North Korea. “With the older analog systems, local governments can transmit but they can’t receive,” Maekawa explained. “But digital systems make it possible for citizens to report in via wireless telephones that are mounted on the speaker poles, for example. This can be a big help in accounting for people’s safety and directing emergency responses.” Yet only 30 percent of existing systems have been upgraded to digital, according to statistics from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. While emergency broadcasting is the raison d’être for bōsai musen, most local governments also use them for public announcements. Where I live we get occasional announcements such as reminders to vote on election days. But apparently some local governments overuse the systems, bombarding citizens with information they’d rather receive via quieter means. “The noise of the outdoor broadcasts is definitely an issue,” Maekawa told me. Complaints dropped off after the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011, when people were feeling the importance of emergency broadcasts, but the noise can be bothersome, particularly for people who work at night and sleep during the day. While researching your question, I stumbled onto a website operated by an irate citizen who is chronicling the broadcast’s overuse in the town of Anamizu in Ishikawa Prefecture (population: 9,700). Every morning at 7 a.m. the town plays the following announcement: “Ohayō! Kyō mo ichinichi ganbarimashō!” (“Good morning! Let’s do our best today too!). That alone would be enough to make me move, but the town also broadcasts reminders to dispose of garbage properly, sign up for health examinations and speak kindly to children. In some cases announcements are repeated as many as five times a day, according to the site owner, who complained, “Who said living in the countryside is peaceful?” But let’s get back to music. Fujitsu General offers 32 different standards, for which they pay appropriate royalties, and will load special music on request. Top favorites for bōsai musen include “Yuyake Koyake,” a Japanese folk song, but Western numbers also rank. The town of Amakusa in Kumamoto Prefecture, for example, plays “Go Tell Aunt Rhody.” (In case you’ve forgotten, the first stanza of that American folk song ends, “Her old gray goose is dead.”) Someday, the sounds of bōsai musen may be heard outside of Japan, as manufacturers and disaster-management experts are looking at its export potential. As we unfortunately learned in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, not all governments have the means to warn their citizens quickly,. Emergency broadcasting is one area in which Japan has special expertise. I think it would be nice if that could be made available to the world.",

    "source": "Disaster long lurked amid Japan's isolation <eos> “The evolution of political thought in this relatively isolated island nation during the period in question is unique to the point of being somewhat freakish.” This gives a reader pause. Freakish? The judgment is historian Hiroshi Watanabe’s in “A History of Japanese Political Thought, 1600-1901,” his 2010 book whose title defines “the period in question.” “Nor,” he adds, “did it (Japanese political thought) have much impact on thought outside the Japanese archipelago. In this sense, it may call to mind the strange animals of the Galapagos Islands, pursuing their own evolutionary path.” Japan, Galapagos: The association seems irresistible and recurs frequently, expressing bewilderment, frustration, amusement, sometimes admiration at Japan’s tendency, even today, to be startlingly different from other “Western” developed democracies. Early-modern Japan was truly a political and cultural Galapagos. Apart from a handful of Chinese and Dutch traders restricted to an island off Nagasaki, it was a “closed country”; Japanese could not leave, foreigners could not enter — on pain of death. Seventeenth- and 18th-century Japan to all intents and purposes was not part of the world. It was a world unto itself. The Tokugawa shoguns, its rulers from 1603 to 1867, were acting in self-defense against foreign powers they saw, reasonably enough, as predatory — not that Japan was a shining live-and-let-live exception, as its 1592 invasion of Korea showed; but the issue was practical, not moral. Isolation, deemed the best defense, was ruthlessly imposed. In a sense it came naturally. Geographical isolation helps explain why Japan circa A.D. 300 had barely graduated from the stone age to primitive agriculture. That might have sounded a warning, had the shoguns been historians. Isolation has a price: backwardness. Inevitably? Perhaps not. Was Tokugawa Japan backward? To U.S. sailors who came in “black ships” to pry it open in the 1850s, it seemed so; they vaunted their “triumphant revelation to a partially enlightened people of the success of science and enterprise.” On the other hand … there is always an “other hand.” Tokugawa Japan was in intellectual ferment, but one occurring in a vacuum. These years correspond to Europe’s Age of Reason, its Enlightenment. Fresh air! Experiment, observation, free thought. A thing was no longer true merely because Aristotle or the Church had said it. Philosophers began by doubting everything they thought they knew. They sought new knowledge. They went back to square one. They challenged each other, spurred each other on, built on each others’ findings. This was an intellectual, created “new world” to match the physical, discovered New World: America. All this Japan missed. “Ours is a world in which living things are confined and regimented as if dead things” — so wrote a despairing artist, scholar and samurai named Watanabe Kazan, one whose restlessness in the shuttered little world he was born into led to his suicide in 1841 at age 48. In 1821, while traveling on domain business, he stopped at the island of Enoshima off present-day Kanagawa Prefecture, and wrote in his diary: “How wonderful! How marvelous! From here to the southeast is what the Westerners call the Pacific Ocean and the American states! They must be very close!” Kazan was one of a coterie of “Dutch scholars” — so called because the Dutch traders and Dutch books were their prime sources — who congregated in Edo (now Tokyo) to share what little they knew of Western science, gunnery, medicine, history, geography and politics. Their talk was considered subversive by an absolutist regime determined at all costs to remain absolute. Watanabe barely escaped execution — he was rusticated instead. He and his friends of course represented the future, though few at the time would have seen that. To most of its subjects, Tokugawa rule must have seemed unshakable. What preoccupied the intellectual mainstream? This question in particular: Is the nation’s true path the Confucian Way, or the Japanese Way? Watanabe, the historian, has a beautiful passage about time machines: “Investigating the past, one is often seized with the desire to board a time machine to walk the city streets and meet the people of some specific period. … In fact we already have a highly advanced time machine: the written word.” Reading past thinkers’ works is a salutary reminder of how the world is subject to wildly varying interpretations. Was Confucius a fool, and his Tokugawa followers dupes for believing all problems were at bottom moral; that disasters natural, political and economic occurred only when sage-rulers failed to govern according to rites and music? Arai Hakuseki (1657-1725), a shogunal adviser and great Confucian thinker, wrote: “Rites and music are not properly practiced, and there are places where the qi (spirit) of heaven and earth is disturbed. Thus, without the assistance of the gods and spirits, it is possible that the principle of germination cannot be achieved” — an admonitory reference to Shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune’s failure to produce an heir. But the swelling ranks of anti-Confucian nativist thinkers sneered at this Chinese frippery. One, Kaibara Ekiken (1630-1714), wrote, “The path of the soldier is a deceitful one. Depending upon the circumstances of the moment, one might trick or betray one’s allies, usurp the spoils won by others, or throw the land into turmoil and seize it from above: As a matter of military tactics, there is nothing wrong with this. It is the way of warfare in Japan. If one adopted the Chinese Way, it would be difficult to conduct warfare in the Japanese manner. Japan is a martial nation; it would be impossible to triumph here following the undissembling and soft customs of the Chinese.” So much for rites and music. The trouble was, Tokugawa Japan was a martial nation at peace . It’s an impossible contradiction. The looming crisis was unseen but inevitable.",

    "source": "Team Abe's grand plan leaves ghosts in charge of a haunted house <eos> As I observe Team Abe in action at the helm of the Bank of Japan and elsewhere, a rather terrifying passage from a poem by William Hughes Mearns comes to mind: “Yesterday, upon the stair, I met a man who wasn’t there. He wasn’t there again today. I wish, I wish he’d go away . . .” There were no surprises in the BOJ’s announcement last week about the new monetary policy package formed at its Policy Board meeting. Quantitative easing will be carried out on an unprecedented scale. Buying up of Japanese government bonds will also take place at record-breaking levels. That buying will find new focus on the longer end of the yield curve spectrum. For all intents and purposes this is no longer a central bank. This is an agent of the government studiously intent on securing its master’s approval. An additional worry in this context is that the BOJ Policy Board’s decision to go for Team Abe’s gung-ho approach to monetary management was apparently unanimous. Was there not one person among the policymaking body who felt inclined to contest the Team Abe approach? We do indeed live in sad and strange times if that was the case. The more we discover about Team Abe’s approach to economic management, the stronger my image grows of the man on the stairs who wasn’t there. For there is a curious touch of unreality in all of the measures and pronouncements that emanate from these people. They seem to have no feel for what is actually happening on the economic ground. All that they are concerned about is how to “regain” Japan. This is very backward-looking of them. The Japan that they seem to want to regain belongs in the 1960s. Thus preoccupied with the past, they are incapable of placing themselves in the here and now. Hence, they are the people on the stair who are not there. The “there” they occupy is not the same as ours. Because the people who are not there are out of touch with real people, their only partner in dialogue is the markets. No wonder the not-there people are so intent on appeasement. They seem to be confusing market-pleasing with policymaking. The markets know this and will always be clamoring for more. The more you give them, the greedier they get. The not-there people have allowed themselves to be taken hostage by the gluttonous. It is a frightening thing to have to place economic management in the hands of people who are not there. Not being there, they cannot know what people are really feeling, what their real problems are and how they are trying to deal with them. Not being there, they cannot feel other people’s pain. There is something altogether heartless in what they say and seem to want to do. Mindlessness has always been a problem with Japanese politics, and there is no reason to assume otherwise about this government. The almost automatic resort to Rip van Winkle economics testifies to that effect. To this great tradition has now been added the element of heartless unconcern that exhorts self-help and looks coldly on a caring society. Mindlessness is a misfortune but heartlessness is sin. To be saddled with a government that is equipped with both is sheer disaster for a nation. Yet what else can one expect from people who are not there? If only we could wish them away. William Hughes Mearns received inspiration for his piece from a reputedly haunted house where the man who wasn’t there was supposed to make his nonappearance. Japan is now that haunted house.",

    "source": "Casting a little light on fireflies <eos> If dragonflies are the insects of Japan’s day, then the mysterious, magical fireflies are its bugs of the night. About now, firefly grubs will be emerging from rivers around the country. They’ve been living in the mud in larval form for the last year, and are ready to start the final, crucial part of their lives. They will pupate, and in June the chrysalis will split and the adult firefly — actually a beetle, because like all beetles they have a hard wing case while flies don’t — will emerge. Fireflies have an unmistakable and quite beautiful feature: They generate their own light source through a process known as bioluminescence. This phenomenon is actually a means of communication between male and female fireflies — but what no one knew until now was that, in Japan, it is the females who call the shots. In North American species, a male advertises for females by flashing his light on and off. However, in the case of the Asian firefly (Luciola parvula) — the one found in Japan — it is the females who do the advertising. It would be going too far to draw any parallels with human sexual behavior in North America and Japan, for instance, but it wouldn’t surprise me if someone does: Fireflies cause more buzz, much of it ill-informed, than most insects in Japan. The two main species here, known as the Genji firefly and the Heike firefly, are named after two clans (aka Minamoto and Taira, respectively) who fought the Battle of Dannoura at sea off the southern tip of Honshu in 1185. The souls of the dead samurai were supposed to have transmuted into fireflies of the two different species. Not a bad place to go, I suppose, and quite samurai-like, as the adults live brief lives of only two weeks or so. That they are deeply loved in Japan is nicely illustrated in a new study on firefly communication. The first author, Hideo Takatsu, is a member of the Aichi Fireflies Society — indeed, that’s the official affiliation given on the paper. His co-authors, more conventionally, are affiliated with Keio and Shizuoka universities. Takatsu and colleagues suspected that female Heike fireflies signal to males, and set about building an electronic firefly to test the idea. By mimicking female flashing behavior with their fake firefly, Takatsu’s team showed that females specifically flash to attract males (Journal of Ethology, DOI: 10.1007/s10164-012-0332-2). In other species of firefly, biologists know that females choose males on the basis of the signals the males send. This sets up opposing evolutionary pressures on the males. Natural selection acts to try to reduce the amount of light the males emit, as predators use the light to locate the insects and eat them. But sexual selection works in the other direction, to increase the light in order to attract more females, have more sex and sire more offspring. Sexual selection, in this case, turns out to be more powerful, and signaling by phosphorescent light has evolved despite the dangers of predation. Sexual selection usually acts strongly on males because they have more to gain from mating many times, whereas the benefits to females from multiple sexual partners are less obvious. In the famous example, it’s why male peacocks are colorful and elaborate but the females are drab. So what’s happening here? For one thing, the study shows the diversity of behavior in these Asian insects. Females seem to be actively encouraging males to approach. They can even mate without the male signaling in response. “Spontaneous female flashes can lead to copulation without male flashes,” Takatsu and colleagues write. Why would they do that? Could it be that they are more desperate to mate than other species of firefly? One reason may be food, or more precisely, resources. Fireflies sip dewdrops of water from plants but don’t eat for the short time they are adults, relying on the stores of fat they laid down when they were larvae. (Gruesome aside: The larvae feed on mud snails, biting the snails and injecting digestive juices.) Additionally, however, males offer some valuable victuals in the form of a nutritious protein capsule that they transfer along with their sperm when they mate. Females can turn the capsule into eggs, and increase their output by doing so. So females have good reason to want to attract males. It doesn’t take much energy to produce a flash of light — it’s made by a chemical in the abdomen called luciferin which is stored in cells lined with a reflective layer of crystals. And though there is the risk of attracting predators, there is the potential reward of a rich male. It’s no surprise that fireflies are so loved in Japan. There are firefly-watching events and, as we have seen, firefly societies. High school students sing “Hotaru no Hikari” (“Glow of a Firefly”) on graduation — to the tune of “Auld Lang Syne.” The words to “Hotaru no Hikari” relate how ultradiligent students work by the light of the firefly, but no doubt the ephemeral nature of the animal — burning bright for a short time before dying — also appeals to emotional teenagers. It certainly appeals to me. I once tried to learn a little of the language of the firefly — you could call it “fireflyese” — and shared a magical moment with some in the wilds of Ibaraki Prefecture. If come June you are lucky enough to see these most beguiling of insects, try “talking” to them with a small flashlight. Even without a dialogue, it’s a marvelous sight. How much more intriguing to imagine the evolutionary pressures and struggles — the romance and battling — behind the beautiful display. And as is so often the case in stories like this, it ends with a warning. Overuse of pesticides and herbicides and fertilizers, together with habitat loss, has hit populations of fireflies hard. They need clean water and undisturbed streams to live and grow. See them while you can.",

Recently, an observant fan noticed there are different numbers on each bottle and decided to investigate. To his delight he found 60 numbers on the the straight tea version and 18 on the lemon tea and milk tea. His interest piqued, he bought all of them and took photos of each in sequence. Although it is hinted at on Gogo no Koucha’s site , only a clever and dedicated tea drinker would go to all this trouble. By lining up each “frame” in video form, he revealed short animations of each character.

    "source": "Yakuza links put nation at added nuclear risk <eos> On April 15, two alleged terrorists in Boston killed three people, injured more than 170 others and terrified a nation — for about $100 it cost them to modify pressure cookers into bombs. We should be glad they didn’t come to Japan, where they may have been able to explode a ready-made nuclear dirty bomb, kill untold thousands, render huge swaths of the country uninhabitable — and get paid by Tokyo Electric Power Co. (Tepco) in the process. I wish I were kidding. Japan has more than 50 gigantic nuclear “pressure cookers” ripe for exploitation by terrorists. And they wouldn’t even have to lay siege to the facilities. Instead, they could just walk into a nuclear plant and leave with enough weapons-grade plutonium for a small atomic device — which later could be detonated wherever they chose. How? In Japan, getting access to a nuclear power plant is very simple: fill out a job application. It is now more than two years since the start of the nuclear crisis following the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, and there are still no mandatory background checks for workers at its nuclear facilities. After the three reactor meltdowns at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear complex in March 2011, it became clear that Tepco, the plant’s operator, was allowing members of Japan’s organized crime groups, the yakuza, to staff the well-paid cleanup — just as they had been allowed into plants long before then. Indeed, members and associates of the Sumiyoshi-kai (Kanto) and Kudo-kai (Kyushu) mobs have been arrested for their roles supplying labor to Tepco and its Kansai cousin, Kepco. So the dirty secret that yakuza-linked workers and companies have long sustained Japan’s nuclear industry — along with yakuza members themselves, ex-convicts, wanted criminals, and drug addicts working there — is now public knowledge. Although many yakuza groups claim to have a protective role in society, most of their members are sociopathic felons who would commit theft, assault or murder to make a little money. And if you consider the black-market value of a little plutonium, you may feel a tad uneasy knowing such people have long had access to it — and can still get their hands on nuclear materials. Don’t worry, though: Last month the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) said a panel will be set up to discuss atomic energy security issues, and it will consider introducing a system to investigate the backgrounds of workers to avoid acts of terrorism at nuclear plants. Specifically, it seems the panel will examine ways to check whether nuclear facility employees are drug addicts or have a criminal record, among other issues, in order to screen out anyone who could potentially get involved in terrorism. The panel will comprise NRA Commissioner Kenzo Oshima and outside experts. However, one expert who will not be on the panel is Haruki Madarame, former chief of the now-dissolved Nuclear Safety Commission. He is currently being investigated by prosecutors for alleged criminal negligence. But hey, let’s not dwell on the past. The good news is that the NRA is thinking about making nuclear plants safer in the future. They may even reach the same conclusions that the Nuclear Security Expert Commission of the Atomic Energy Commission announced … in September 2011. Of course, why take action when you can spend more time debating about taking action? The AEC makes recommendations for nuclear energy policy. However, that 2011 report, titled “Basic Nuclear Security Assurance,” doesn’t give a positive view of Japan’s countermeasures. There, the words “internal threats” appear five times in 14 pages of attached materials. And, in a section headed “Lessons of Fukushima,” it notes: “It is clear there were defects in the management of those leaving and entering the site from the start of the accident. … Licensed (nuclear facility) operators need to first strictly enforce measures to keep suspicious persons from sneaking into the facilities and strengthen countermeasures against threats from within.” The report, without irony, also notes that criminal acts such as the theft of nuclear materials to build a dirty bomb, or the destruction of facilities, “should be detected, prevented, and stopped so as to cause as little negative impact as possible to life, physical health, property, society and the environment.” It also recommends that law enforcement, regulators and the power plant operators share information to make sure that thieves, saboteurs or criminals do not have access to the plants or related facilities. But it stops short of mandating background checks. The United States has long had a screening system in place, but Japan has delayed taking similar measures due to privacy concerns and “respect for human rights.” Meanwhile, Tepco is still unable to locate scores of workers who entered the disaster zone. Maybe, though, we shouldn’t worry so about criminals gaining access to nuclear plants. After all, the National Diet of Japan’s Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission report in 2012 established Tepco’s responsibility for the triple meltdown. Then months later Tepco admitted it consciously ignored the threat of a tsunami-related disaster. So perhaps the lesson to be learned is that the greatest threat of “nuclear terrorism” Japan faces is from criminally negligent power companies and a government that fails to punish them. Come to think of it, maybe we shouldn’t worry at all about criminals gaining access to the nuclear power plants. As the Tokyo Prosecutor Office’s investigation into the top executives of Tepco for professional negligence resulting in injury and death grinds on, it seems more and more likely that criminals have been running the plants for a very long time — they just don’t all have tattoos. When it comes to the nuclear security in Japan, the U.S. comics “swamp critter” Pogo Possum would tell you: “We have met the enemy, and he is us.” Let’s hope no other enemies decide to join the party — because if they do, Japan’s nuclear negligence may become the world’s problem as well.",

    "source": "Utility, ubiquity playing key roles in corrupting policymakers' thinking <eos> Two mind-sets seem to be catching on in Japan these days. They worry me. One is the notion that something has to be useful to be of value. The other is that anything is justifiable on the grounds that everybody else is doing it. The theory of usefulness is driving the Abe government’s promotion of better working conditions for women. They deserve longer maternity leave because they constitute an as yet inadequately utilized source of economic growth. To the extent that women are useful to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new growth strategy, they will be placed at the center of the government’s concerns. But there might just possibly be an ulterior motive to all of this. Abe could well be looking at his extended maternity leave campaign as a useful way to keep women at home for longer parts of their lives. This government’s conservative heart yearns for the revival of traditional family values, and they might be hoping to make good strategic use of the let’s-be-nice-to-women campaign as a means to that end. Of even greater concern is that the utility theory appears to be putting pressure on people who are neither obsessed with grand growth strategies nor holders of sinister ulterior motives. I was recently asked by campaigners against Japanese constitutional reform whether an economic case could be made in support of retaining the pacifist Constitution as it is. The argument would be that a peaceful nation would have access to greater economic gain than an antagonistic one because the rest of the world would be more willing to trade with peaceable people who have vowed not to wage war against anybody. Thus, it could be said that abandoning war is useful to enhancing the welfare of the nation. “Would this logic hold water?” they asked. My heart goes out to those campaigners. They are facing an uphill job if they have to resort to notions of economic utility to convince people of the importance of remaining peaceful. You uphold peace because that’s the right thing to do. You secure better working conditions for women because they have a rightful claim to such treatment. No other reasoning or justification is necessary to do something that is decent and just. Yet it increasingly seems to be the fashion of the day to demand “results.” To weigh costs against benefits. To uphold usefulness as the ultimate source of legitimacy. The other idea — that if everybody else is doing it, you should, too — is often called upon to justify the Bank of Japan’s huge monetary easing. The Americans are doing it. The Europeans are doing it. Japan has been persistently falling behind. It’s time we caught up with everybody else. The BOJ is culpable for deflation. They should get on with the job of doing what everybody has been doing all this time. So goes the argument. There is not one iota of concern in this line of reasoning, however, over what central banks were made for in the first place. Their role as defender of the currency is being quite studiously ignored. As for the idea that the use of “comfort women” has always been standard practice in times of war and Japan should therefore not be singled out for bashing, the whole mind-set is beneath contempt. However widespread it may be, a despicable deed is ever a despicable deed. There is no strength in numbers where questions of human dignity are concerned. You do not violate human rights even if you are in a minority of one. However useless, you do what is right. However lonely, you keep away from indecency. End of story.",

    "source": "How signs of a 'lost continent' came into JAMSTEC's underwater view <eos> The Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and the Brazilian government recently announced the discovery of a large mass of granite on the seafloor off Rio de Janeiro — a landmark finding that suggests a continent may have once existed there because granite normally forms only on dry land. Experts say it’s far too early to conclude this is evidence that the legendary island of Atlantis existed. This is because the seabed where the granite mass was found is estimated to have sunk into the sea several tens of millions of years ago, much earlier than legend has the island disappearing beneath the sea. But how did the Japanese agency get involved in this intriguing discovery in the first place? Following are some facts regarding the organization and its activities: What is the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology? Headquartered in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, the agency conducts research and development in marine sciences. Formerly known as the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center, JAMSTEC was launched in April 2004 as an independent administrative agency administered by the Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry. What was JAMSTEC doing off the east coast of Brazil? The agency sent a mission to the area as part of its one-year around-the-world voyage project dubbed “QUELLE2013,” which stands for Quest for the Limit of Life. “Quelle” also means “roots” or “origin” in German. The yearlong mission involves exploring hydrothermal vent fields, submarine seepage sites, deep-sea trenches and other extreme environments to explore the habitable limits of life and its unique survival strategies. They set out Jan. 5 on the support vessel Yokosuka, heading for the Indian Ocean, the South Atlantic, the Caribbean Sea and the South Pacific Ocean. So was it just happenstance that JAMSTEC was involved in the recent discovery? According to a JAMSTEC official, the finding was “not totally a coincidence.” They had been aware that Brazilian scientists had collected what appeared to be granite in the area, but it remained a mystery whether the granite was intrinsic or whether it had been dropped by ships passing through, the official said. The discovery was made by a deep-submergence vehicle called the Shinkai 6500, owned by the agency. One researcher who had been aboard the sub was quoted by the official as saying they were admittedly “somewhat skeptical about granite being there.” What is the Shinkai 6500? The submersible was developed “to study seafloor topography and geology and research deep-sea organisms” in the sea not only around Japan but in the oceans around the world. As the name implies, the Shinkai 6500 can dive to depths of up to 6,500 meters with two pilots and one researcher aboard. It entered service in 1991 and had made 1,300 dives as of 2012. During the round-the-world project, the manned submersible is to be in the Caribbean Sea from June to August. After temporarily returning to Japan for a battery replacement from August to September, it is scheduled to travel to the Tonga and Kermadec trenches in the South Pacific and to finish the journey in December. What other kinds of research does the agency conduct? It has several institutes and projects. For example, the Research Institute for Global Change observes, analyzes and predicts global environmental changes, while the Institute for Research on Earth Evolution explores the interior of the Earth to develop a comprehensive understanding of our planet. The agency has also set up a project to do research on earthquakes and tsunami for disaster prevention. Who heads the agency, and how big is it? The president is Asahiko Taira, a former chairman of the Geological Society of Japan. Taira, whose field of research includes marine geology and plate tectonics, received the Japan Academy Prize in 2007 for research on the formation of the Japanese archipelago. The agency has a staff of 1,055, including 383 researchers. The initial budget for the current fiscal year stands at ¥40.2 billion.",

    "source": "Sub discovers signs of legendary Atlantis <eos> RIO DE JANEIRO - A large mass of granite has been found on the seabed off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, suggesting a continent may have existed in the Atlantic Ocean, the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and the Brazilian government announced. A Brazilian official said the discovery of the granite — which normally forms only on dry land — is strong evidence that a continent used to exist in the area where the legendary island of Atlantis, mentioned in antiquity by Plato in his philosophical dialogues, was supposedly located. According to legend, the island, host to a highly developed civilization, sunk into the sea around 12,000 years ago. No trace of it has ever been found. The finding was made using a Shinkai 6500 manned submersible operated by the Japanese agency. The seabed where the granite mass was discovered is estimated to have sunk into the sea several tens of million years ago. No man-made structures have been found there. It is the first time such research using a manned submersible has been conducted in the South Atlantic. In late April, the agency used the device to explore the Rio Grande Rise, a seabed more than 1,000 km southeast of Rio de Janeiro. At a depth of 910 meters, it found a rock cliff around 10 meters in height and breadth. After analyzing video data, the agency concluded it was granite. Also discovered in the area around it was a large volume of quartz sand — which is also not formed in the sea. The bedrock is believed to consist mainly of basalt rock. The rise itself stretches around 1,000 km at the widest point, and is considered part of the continent left behind when South America and Africa split apart more than 100 million years ago. The agency said it assumes the area was above sea level until about 50 million years ago but became submerged over a period spanning several million years, based on fossils found in the nearby seabed and other data. According to the agency, the Rio Grande Rise is the only plausible area that could possibly have been dry land in the past. Despite the latest discovery, however, experts remained cautious about jumping to conclusions about Atlantis. Shinichi Kawakami, a professor at Gifu University versed in planetary sciences, said the granite could have been a part of a big continent before it separated into what is now Africa and South America. “South America and Africa used to be a huge, unified continent. The area in question may have been left in water as the continent was separated in line with the movements of plates,” he said. Kawakami said researchers must look further into the composition of the granite and see if it matches the granite now found in Africa or South America. “The concept of Atlantis came way before geology of the modern age was established. We should not jump to the Atlantis (conclusion) right away,” he said.",

    "source": "Monju: Generating only misfortune <eos> The troubled Monju prototype fast-breeder reactor made headlines again when the Nuclear Regulation Authority said it apparently plans to ensure the facility remains idled after announcing that the Japan Atomic Energy Agency failed to properly inspect some 10,000 components, including critical ones. Following are questions and answers regarding the problem-plagued Monju program, which has so far cost some ¥1 trillion: Where is Monju located and when was it built? Monju is on the Sea of Japan coast in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture. Preparatory construction began in January 1983, and the site was completed in April 1991. The reactor reached initial criticality for the first time in April 1994, but the event was short-lived. What was Monju’s role? Monju was to serve as a research facility on so-called dream technology that was supposed to resolve Japan’s shortage of clean energy sources. The plan was for the fast-breeder reactor to use spent nuclear fuel from other atomic plants in the form of a plutonium-uranium mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. “The basic principles of the Monju plant are very simple,” JAEA states on its website. If the recycling sequence goes as planned, it would mean “fast reactors could extend the energy output from the world’s uranium fuel reserves 25-fold.” MOX, however, which is used in nuclear weapons, is highly dangerous. How has Monju fared since the 1994 criticality test? Accidents, a coverup attempt and other woes and malfunctions have keet the reactor effectively idled since its initial tryout. A sodium coolant leak and fire in 1995 became a huge scandal after it was revealed that the operator tried to cover up details of the incident from the public. In 1996, an official appointed to the internal investigation of the case committed suicide. The official’s next of kin subsequently sued the operator for damages, claiming he killed himself after being pressured to lie to the media. The Supreme Court last year rejected the suit and ruled in JAEA’s favor. Fukui residents meanwhile sued the state, claiming the reactor is unsafe. The Supreme Court in 2005 overruled a lower court ruling and dismissed the suit. What happened after the sodium leak? Monju was suspended for 14 years and five months after the leak, until May 2010. The JAEA website states that Monju restarted its System Start-up Test on May 6, 2010, hoping to accomplish the program’s original mission of demonstrating the facility’s reliability and establishing sodium handling technology. It failed to do either. On Aug. 26 that year, a 3-ton fuel-loading device fell into the reactor vessel and caused operations to halt again. Recovery of the device proved time-consuming and was only completed in June 2011, 10 months after the incident and shortly into the biggest nuclear plant calamity to hit the world since Chernobyl, namely the triple-meltdown crisis at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima No. 1 atomic plant. It cost more than ¥1.7 billion to repair the Monju damage. A JAEA official in charge of the recovery project committed suicide before the fuel-loading device was retrieved. What other troubles stand in Monju’s way? Like most nuclear plants in Japan, Monju is believed to be sitting on a fault, although JAEA in April sent a report to the NRA claiming the fault is inactive. The JAEA has also said the reactor can withstand the strongest temblor that could possibly hit the site, as well as tsunami of up to 21 meters. The NRA is expected to visit Fukui and survey the fault soon. What does “monju” mean? According to JAEA, Monju derives from the Japanese translation of bodhisattva Manjusri, which is associated with perfect enlightenment and wisdom. Buddhist temples, including Eiheiji in Fukui Prefecture, have protested the use of the holy name for such a tarnished project. What’s next for Monju? Reports say Monju costs ¥10 billion to ¥20 billion annually just to maintain even while idled. The government originally intended to start commercial use of the reactor by 2050, but the latest development will likely put the nuclear fuel-recycling goal on indefinite hold. Despite widespread public opposition to nuclear power since 2011 and calls by pundits that Monju be scrapped, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party appears reluctant to do this. How is JAEA reacting to the latest scandal? In a Chunichi Shimbun interview published on May 1, JAEA chief Hiroshi Hiroi acknowledged the agency failed to properly check some 10,000 components. “Due to a lack of communication between the managers and onsite workers, our revised rules weren’t completely followed, and we didn’t share a common understanding of when to start the checks,” he claimed. JAEA seeks to correct the problem by adding 13 more employees to the repair unit, creating better information management and educating its workers. “We will make a safe, rational maintenance program in about a year,” he told the newspaper.",

    "source": "Japan's Suzaku satellite shows how all bets are off around Cygnus X-1 <eos> This month, the Vermillion bird of the South — which is currently flying 550 km above Earth — meets an astronomical swan some 6,000 light-years away. In Eastern mythology, the Vermillion bird of the South represents fire — it is a spirit creature renowned for its elegance and power. Its Japanese name, Suzaku, is also that of an X-ray-detecting satellite launched by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency in 2005. Now Suzaku’s eyes have been trained on one of the most famous objects in the galaxy — the black hole in the constellation Cygnus (meaning “Swan”), which is also sometimes known as the Northern Cross. What Suzaku has seen there is arguably more wondrous than the most fantastical mythological story: It has observed the swan at dinner; the black hole swallowing dead stars. Black holes are strongly embedded in our culture. We refer to them metaphorically (“that business was a black hole for money”), while the best-known of many mind-boggling facts about black holes — that nothing, not even light, can escape them — is probably familiar to most of us even if we don’t really understand what it means. All that is to say it’s easy to take black holes for granted. But in fact, while astronomers strongly suspect they must exist, that suspicion is maddeningly hard to prove. Strictly speaking, the things we think of as black holes are only black hole candidates . However, Suzaku is armed with telescopes that, instead of picking up visible light, detect X-rays, which are more powerful than visible light. And now, its observations have provided good evidence that these most mysterious of astronomical objects are real. Shin’ya Yamada and colleagues at the Riken Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science at Wako in Saitama Prefecture directed Suzaku’s telescopes at an enigmatic object named Cygnus X-1. Discovered in 1964, this is one of the strongest known sources of X-rays in our Milky Way galaxy, and has long been a suspected black hole. (It was the subject of one of the most famous bets in science, as we’ll see.) Cygnus X-1 is a remarkable object. Its mass is 15 times greater than that of our sun, but it is far more compact. The diameter of our sun is 1.4 million km, while that of Cygnus X-1 is only 52 km. Earth’s diameter is 12,700 km. So in Cygnus X-1, a gigantic amount of matter has been compacted down into an incredibly small space. The more massive an object, the stronger its gravitational pull, which means that Cygnus X-1 has irresistible suction power. Anything that gets close is sucked in. Black holes accumulate massive amounts of matter — dust, gas, rocks, even bits of planets and stars — in a huge disc that orbits the black hole, gradually getting closer. This is called the accretion disc, and it is from this that powerful X-rays are emitted as the gravity of the black hole crushes the matter in the disc. Once stuff gets too close, however, it can never break free. The point of no return is called the event horizon. What the Riken astronomers observed is gas being sucked across the event horizon and into oblivion. Suzaku measured the temperature of the gas as it fell into the black hole, and recorded a heat spike of more than 1 billion degrees Celsius in the last few milliseconds before it vanished. This, they report in Astrophysical Journal, is strong evidence that Cygnus X-1 is indeed a black hole (DOI reference: 10.1088/2041-8205/767/2/L34). For at least 20 years, most physicists have been happy to accept that Cygnus X-1 is a black hole. Indeed, that was what the bet was about. In 1974 the English cosmologist Stephen Hawking and his similarly renowned U.S. colleague and friend, Kip Thorne, were arguing about this faraway object. Hawking wagered that Cygnus X-1 was not a black hole — but in 1990, he finally conceded he was wrong. The Hawking-Thorne wager can be seen as the end point in a longer debate among scientists about black holes. Albert Einstein, whose work showed among other things that gravity could influence light (and even bend it), himself did not believe that black holes could exist. But theoretical work supporting the idea of a super-dense object that warps space-time continued to build, and by the 1960s it was generally accepted that black holes should exist. Some physicists credit the discovery of Cygnus X-1 as the first time a black hole was found. Incidentally, the terms of the Hawking-Thorne bet shed interesting light on the reading habits of these famous scientists. If Hawking had won, his reward would have been a four-year subscription to the fortnightly Private Eye, Britain’s foremost satirical magazine. Thorne requested, and hence received, a year’s subscription to Penthouse, a U.S. monthly that may euphemistically be termed a “men’s magazine.” (Hawking reported that Thorne’s wife was not happy with her husband’s winnings.) Meanwhile, Suzaku continues to look deep into the galaxy. Last year, after its X-ray scopes were directed at the constellation of Orion, it observed an usually bright patch of cosmic dust known as McNeil’s Nebula. This region turned out to be a protostar, a region of space where the magnetic fields are so intense that they are heating the surrounding area and emitting X-rays. Kenji Hamaguchi, an astrophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said he suspected that the protostar, which is still swaddled in its birthing cloud, is a mere baby in astronomical terms at younger than a million years old — but not the sort of babe Thorne was seeing when he won his bet.",

    "source": "Abe's 15-month reversal budget fudges cost of swapping people and butter for concrete and guns <eos> The government of Shinzo Abe has just unveiled its budget for fiscal 2013 starting in April. Abe’s stated intention was to “radically reset” spending priorities. He is indeed a man of his word. For this is a budget that is truly awesome for its radical step backward into the past — a past where every public spending project would do wonders to boost economic growth. It is also a past where a cheaper yen would bring unmitigated benefits to Japan’s exporting industries. None of it is really true anymore. Public works do indeed do wonders in boosting growth when there is nothing there to begin with. But in a mature and well-developed economy like ours, which is already so well equipped with all the necessities of modern life, they can at best have only a one-off effect in creating jobs and demand. And in this globalized day and age, an exporting industry imports almost as much as it exports. No longer do we live in a world where a carmaker makes everything within the borderlines of its nationality. Abe’s radical reset has just as much to do with philosophy as with timelines. Three phrases come to mind as I try to put this budget in a nutshell. They are: “from people to concrete,” “from the regions to the center” and “from butter to guns.” The previous government led by the Democratic Party of Japan declared that it would put people before concrete. No more building of ever-empty concert halls and useless multiple amenity centers where nothing ever happens. More money would be spent on helping people escape their economic difficulties. They would give more power to the regions so they could decide for themselves what was really good and worked for the local community. Guns would most certainly not take precedence over butter. Or rather over the low-fat butter alternatives popular in these more health-conscious times. All of this has been completely reversed in Abe’s fiscal 2013 budget. Public works spending is scheduled to go up by more than 15 percent while subsistence payments for people on welfare will be thrashed to the tune of more than 7 percent. If implemented, this will be the largest cut ever in welfare assistance. The previous government set aside a lump sum to be transferred from the central government’s coffers to regional municipalities to be spent at their own discretion on local projects. This sum will now be clawed back into the central government’s own public works program. The planned increase in spending on guns is admittedly small: a 0.8 percent increase over the fiscal 2012 initial budget. It is nonetheless the first increase of its kind in 11 years. And given the thrashing being dealt to welfare spending, the shift in emphasis from butter to guns is clearly apparent. One of the Abe government’s boasts is that it will manage to hold down the overall size of the budget in comparison with fiscal 2012. The other one is that it will raise more revenues from taxes rather than borrowing. True enough on the face of it. But one has to remember the very big supplementary budget that the government intends to push through for the remainder of fiscal 2012. The money for that program will come mostly from borrowing. Since the government is talking about a “15-month budget” that “seamlessly links up” the fiscal 2012 supplementary and fiscal 2013 initial budgets, they should talk in the same vein about the size of their spending and the borrowing needed to accommodate the whole 15-month package. It will not do to smother the big reset with a big coverup.",

He soon began working for Pacific Stars and Stripes, where he gained a reputation as a prolific writer of film reviews. After a stint back in the United States, he returned to Japan and began writing regularly for The Japan Times in 1954. Richie wrote hundreds of articles for the newspaper, covering not only film, but his other passions of theater, literature and art. He continued to write for the newspaper through 2009. Richie also published many books, including “The Japanese Film: Art and Industry,” which he coauthored with Joseph Anderson in 1959. Between 1969 and 1972, Richie was in New York, working as a curator of film at the New York Museum of Modern Art. He is also known for his travel writing. “The Inland Sea,” a memoir of his journey to the Seto Inland Sea that was first published in 1971, is considered a classic of the genre. Richie suffered several heart attacks in the past decade. He is survived by his sister, Jean Reuther, who lives in the U.S. Below are interviews with Donald Richie over the years as well as Asian Bookshelf book reviews dating back to 2001.

    "source": "Tokyo Station nears completion, Hitler lauds Japan, high-schools surge, Constitution to keep Article 9, PM declares <eos> 100 YEARS AGO Sunday, Feb. 2, 1913 Tokyo Central station nears completion The Tokyo Central Railway Station, now under construction at Eiraku-cho, Kojimachi Ward [a now-defunct ward spanning much of present-day Chiyoda Ward], will, when completed next year, make one of the finest structures of the metropolis. The station is expected to be ready for general use by June of next year. It is the authorities’ intention that the station, which is being constructed on a 65,300- tsubo (21-hectare) plot of land east of the Imperial Palace, will be made the terminus of the Tokaido Line and also that of the Central Eastern and Sobu lines. The new station building features state-of-the-art materials. It is hardened by concrete and the building itself is made of steel. Brick and stone are applied to cover the steel framework and the floor is built of fireproof ferroconcrete. The price of land in the neighborhood has risen considerably. Mitsubishi Co., a large landowner in that area, expects to take this opportunity to make a big fortune. It is its intention to make a couple of private roads off the grand highway that will be made leading westward from the station, and that the lands the company owns along these new roads will be let in not less than 600-tsubo (2,000-sq.-meter) plots. It is expected these plots will be occupied by large commercial and banking corporations, such as seen in the West and it is not difficult to predict there will be built a sort of “Imperial Bazaar” and “International Buildings.” There will also be put up various kinds of hotels, clubs and restaurants. 75 YEARS AGO Monday, Feb. 21, 1938 Hitler lauds Japan; hails Manchukuo Formal German recognition of Manchukuo [the Imperial Japanese puppet state established in 1932 in northeast China and Inner Mongolia] was announced by Reichsfuehrer Adolf Hitler in his much-awaited speech before the Reichstag this afternoon, declaring that whatever the outcome of the Sino-Japanese conflict may be, Germany regards Japan as the defender of Western civilization in the Far East. Openly supporting Japan for the first time since the start of the crisis, the Chancellor, in his 2 hr. 55-min. pronouncement of domestic and foreign policy, condemned the Soviet Union as the “incarnation of the urge to destruction.” Declaring that Germany does not want any international institution to impose upon her an attitude which does not resemble an attitude taken by reasonable persons, the Chancellor briefly stated that Germany will recognize Manchukuo. “I believe that defeat of Japan in the Far East would solely profit the U.S.S.R.,” he shouted, adding that “the greatest Japanese victory would be much less dangerous for world culture than a Bolshevik victory.” He also announced Germany’s decision never to return to the League of Nations, which, he said, always threatens to involve Germany in disputes in which she has no vital interests. The Chancellor’s speech was unprecedentedly violent. He repeatedly attacked the French and British press for hindering the peaceful German relations with neighboring countries. He warned that if ever international agitation against Germany manages to upset the European peace, that “iron and steel will speak.” 50 YEARS AGO Thursday, Feb. 7, 1963 High-schools surge Only a few prefectural governments will be able to meet the April deadline for expanding public high-school capacity in order to accommodate the large 1963 class, which is estimated to number 1.5 million students in comparison with the 1 million in 1960, it was learned recently. Tokyo is the best prepared, with figures from the Metropolitan Office of Education showing its public high schools will have to take 52,343 students in 1963. It will thus be necessary to add 341 more 50-student classes than in 1960. For this purpose, the office has decided to build 25 new high schools for 183 classes and to enlarge the existing 119 schools to handle the remaining 158 classes. All but one of the new schools is set to be finished by the start of the new academic year in April. In Kanagawa and Niigata prefectures, only two of seven new schools will be ready by April. Fukushima, Yamagata and Ibaraki prefectures are also behind schedule. Due to the shortfalls, officials are thinking of using gymnasiums and renting classrooms in junior high schools. Increasing class sizes from 50 to 55 is also part of the Education Ministry’s plan for coping with the situation. 25 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Feb. 2, 1988 Constitution to keep Article 9, PM declares Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita told the House of Representatives’ Budget Committee session Monday that his government would not propose to amend Japan’s four-decade-old Constitution. Noting that the Constitution, drawn up under U.S. Army Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the supreme commander of the allied powers occupying Japan, was once called a “translated Constitution,” Takeshita said, “As a young man, I had a sense of reservation toward (accepting) it. But I do not intend at all to put a Constitutional amendment on our political schedule.” He said “no one” would think of changing the war-renouncing Article 9 or the democratic principles. However, the party platform of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which he heads, aims to develop an “independent Constitution.” In the same session, Takeshita also confirmed that the “three non-nuclear principles” — of not making, not having and not introducing nuclear weapons into Japan — is a fundamental policy of his government. However, he refused demands from the floor for Japan to make a formal inquiry with the United States on the possible introduction of nuclear missiles into U.S. bases in the country.",

    "source": "Fugu reveals its simple gender switch <eos> It’s the most celebrated and notorious fish in the world, certainly in culinary circles. Now the puffer fish — one of Japan’s most enigmatic creatures — meets some of biology’s deepest questions: Why did sex evolve? Why are there two sexes? Why is the male sex chromosome such a puny little thing? I’ll admit right away that the puffer fish, better known in Japan as fugu, won’t provide answers to these questions. But just the story of why an animal usually discussed in sushi shops is the subject of research by a Nobel Prize-winner and scientists at the University of Tokyo is interesting enough, without having to solve deep evolutionary problems. Kiyoshi Kikuchi at the Fisheries Laboratory in the University of Tokyo Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences works on the tiger puffer fish (torafugu; Takifugu rubripes) . This, among several species of fugu, is the one most often eaten, and most often used by scientists. The tiger fugu, as we’ll call it (“fugu” literally means “river pig,” which seems an inelegant name for such a graceful, maneuverable animal), is loved by researchers because it has a small genome — its total amount of DNA is unusually little. This means it’s relatively easy to use the tiger fugu to identify important genes. Its genome was the second vertebrate genome to be sequenced, after that of humans. Like almost all fugu, the tiger puffer fish is chock full of a poison that is one of the most potent found in nature. Tetradoxin is hundreds of times more deadly than the equivalent amount of cyanide, and the average puffer fish contains enough to kill 30 adults. Almost as famous as the fish are the requirements chefs must fulfil to be able to prepare it. It takes two years of training, and an exam that a third of chefs apparently fail, to gain a license to prepare fugu. Not to diminish their skill, but most of the poison is contained in the gonads, the liver, the skin and the intestines, so it’s largely just a question of removing those bits safely. Part of the thrill in eating the fish is that small amounts of toxin remain in the flesh, and you may be able to feel a tingling on your lips as you consume it. If the tingling gets too much, you could be in trouble. And if the tingling thrill isn’t enough, you may be tempted to eat more dangerously. In 2011, a woman in a restaurant in Tokyo’s upscale Ginza district demanded to be served fugu liver. The chef — in defiance of strict regulations — complied, and a few hours later the woman was hospitalized with tetradoxin poisoning. She was lucky — she survived. Less fortunate was Bando Mitsugoro VIII, a famous kabuki actor who, in 1975, demanded four fugu livers, no less, in a Kyoto restaurant. He died as a result. Anyway, Kikuchi’s team has studied fugu more even than the most diligent sushi chef. Their interest concerns the sex chromosomes of the fish, which, as with humans, come in two forms: X and Y. Fish (and people) with two X chromosomes are female, those with an X and a Y are male. In humans and most other mammals, the Y chromosome is a sorry chap, a diminutive stump of DNA in comparison with the mighty X. The Y is just one-third the length of the X chromosome, but it punches above its weight: It carries the all-important gender-determining genes. Fugu have the same X-Y arrangement, but Kikuchi’s team found a crucial difference. Rather than having lots of DNA in the form of genes that need to switch on to determine gender, as in humans, the gender of a fugu is determined by the simplest possible DNA difference between X and Y — such that only one “letter” of DNA is different. Each chromosome is made of 15 million letters of DNA called nucleotides, and in fugu just one change in that 15-million-letter sequence makes the difference between male and female. “We have provided evidence showing that the gender of fugu is most likely determined by a one-nucleotide difference between the X and Y chromosome,” said Kikuchi. The result is significant because it shows an extremely simple example of genetic gender determination. When animals began having sex, they used an environmental method to make males and females. Eggs incubated at a warm temperature might become females, and those kept slightly cooler might become males, for example. That’s all very well, but if you want to be able to retain more control over the gender of your offspring, it’s better to have a genetic switch. The fugu has the simplest possible genetic switch. It represents the starting point on the evolutionary trail that led to the human situation of a specialized Y chromosome. The results are published in the journal PLoS Genetics (DOI reference: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002798). As well as being of evolutionary interest, the authors say that the finding may provide a simple way of determining a fugu’s gender. That might help protect them in the wild. One of the co-authors on Kikuchi’s paper is Nobel Prize-winner Sydney Brenner. He won his gong for work on something called programmed cell death — which is the regulated, genetically programmed death of cells. In the 1950s, he was working at the University of Oxford, and was one of the first people to see Watson and Crick’s model of the structure of DNA. I could not confirm whether Brenner enjoys fugu in the dining room as well as in the lab.",

    "source": "Nori <eos> Dear Alice, I was out for a walk with my camera the other day and came across a puzzling scene. I saw people putting what I thought were squares of dark paper onto easels in the sun, as if to dry. But when I went closer, the squares actually seemed to be nori seaweed sheets, the type used to make sushi rolls. Can you find out what the heck I saw? I eat sushi all the time but I realize I have no idea how nori is made. It would be great if you could explain that too. Duncan L., Tokyo Dear Duncan, By plugging the date and coordinates of your walk into my secret decoder ring, I was able to deduce that you stumbled onto a noritsuke taiken , a make-your-own nori workshop at the Omori Nori Museum. This relatively new educational facility, which opened in Tokyo’s Ota Ward in 2008, runs nori-making workshops on some weekends from January to April. The purpose is to share a fascinating piece of local history, which is that for about 200 years, until the early 1960s, Omori was a thriving center of nori cultivation and manufacture. “Nori” is the Japanese name for a group of edible algae that grows naturally on rocks in shallow areas of cold-water oceans. In English, this type of seaweed is called laver, and it is collected and eaten in some coastal parts of the British Isles. (In Wales, you can still get breakfasts featuring laver bread.) But most English-speakers know this seaweed first and foremost because of sushi, and they are much more likely to understand “nori” than “laver.” In Japan, people have gathered the wild plant off rocks for thousands of years, using it for both food and fertilizer. When Edo (present-day Tokyo) was settled, it was discovered that the tasty sea plant grew in abundance in the nearby bay and up the mouths of rivers that connected to it. In Edo, this seaweed was called “Asakusa” nori, for the place along the Sumida River where it was often collected. Edo fisherman noticed that nori reproduced well around the stakes they drove into the shallows to hold their nets, and by the early 18th century a primitive method of cultivating the seaweed had been devised. Cultivators drove the ends of bamboo sticks into the seabeds at the mouths of rivers near the bay, creating production beds with tidy rows of upright stakes on which the algae could attach and reproduce. To harvest, growers would row out to the beds and laboriously pull the nori off the stakes and into their boats. After a while, it was discovered that the spores did their best reproducing in salty waters, yet bloomed better in water with lower salinity. So villages around the bay began to cooperate to seed stakes in places with salty water and then transplant them to mixed-water shallows near river mouths. Nori had always been eaten wet in Japan, but as cultivation methods improved growers wanted a way to preserve their production. Some clever person, whose identity has unfortunately been lost to history, drew on techniques used in traditional paper-making to come up with nori as we know it today — paper-thin dried sheets that keep well and are perfect for wrapping around rice. From 1894 to 1939, Tokyo was the number-one nori-producing area in Japan, ahead of competitors such as Chiba, Aichi and Hiroshima prefectures. But Tokyo’s industry gradually fell victim to land-reclamation, dredging and pollution. In 1962, the national government offered compensation to fishing cooperatives and nori cultivators to give up their rights in the bay, opening the way for further port development. Today, nori is still cultivated on the far side of Tokyo Bay in Chiba Prefecture, but the most important production areas in Japan are in Kyushu, around the Ariake Sea; in Mie and Aichi prefectures around Ise Bay, and in the Seto Inland Sea. By this point in my research I wanted to see for myself how nori is made, so I signed up for a workshop. Volunteers who had grown up in nori-making households were on hand to take us through the traditional process, showing us how nori was chopped, by hand or using a meat grinder, then mixed with water to make a kind of slurry. Then we got to step up and make sheets for ourselves, which is done by pouring a measure of the slurry into a mold held over a woven, slatted mat. The water drains away, the mold is removed, and what’s left on the mat is a thin layer of chopped seaweed. We then hung our mats on easels in the sun to dry, which is the point in the process at which you must have wandered by. Another interesting fact I picked up is that virtually all nori cultivators in Japan now grow the same variety, a hardy transplant from Hokkaido called susabinori ( Porphyra yezoensis ). Even so, the taste, color and texture of the finished sheets varies widely, depending not on differences in production but rather on the temperature and salinity of the seawater in which it is grown. The sheets of nori you get in stores have been crisped over heat to bring out the flavor, and are called yakinori (“ yaki ” in this case means “toasted”). You can also buy ajitsukenori (flavored nori), which is spiced up with soy sauce, sugar and other seasonings, although I personally prefer the plain. And while I will say that it was interesting to eat nori I made myself, in the future I’m leaving it to the pros. In fact, I’m all fired up to sample products from various regions and explore the differences. Fortunately, nori is an affordable, healthy food, loaded with protein, fiber and beneficial nutrients, including calcium, beta carotene and folate. All that and hardly any calories! Or as an expression I found on a nori wholesaler’s website put it: “ Ichinichi nimai isha irazu ” (“Two sheets a day keeps the doctor away.”)",

    "source": "Chinese smog bomb floats toward Japan <eos> OSAKA - Smog in China has reached alarming levels as its rapid industrialization spews ever-more toxic particles into the air. Over the past month or so, the problem has become particularly acute, raising health concerns in neighboring parts of Asia, including Japan. Following are questions and answers about China’s smog problem and its possible effects on Japan. How and when did China’s smog problem begin? The beginning of China’s current air pollution problem that affects Japan has been traced back to early January and centers on Beijing and areas east of the capital. As smoke from coal-burning power plants combines with vehicle exhaust and factory emissions, it produces a toxic smog that can become especially bad in winter. In recent years, the smog has been getting worse because of the rising popularity of driving in China, which is adding about 15 million cars to its roads each year. In a normal winter, smog would usually be dissipated by the prevailing winds. This year, however, the winds haven’t been as strong, allowing a huge toxic cloud to form. This cloud is now drifting slowly over much of eastern and southeastern China, and is even encroaching on parts of western Japan. I often see the term “PM2.5” used in reports about air pollution. What does it mean? PM stands for “particulate matter,” and 2.5 refers to particles in the air that are 2.5 microns in diameter — about 1/30th the diameter of a human hair. Particles of this size can only be seen through an electron microscope and are easily absorbed by the lungs. PM2.5 particles are generated by burning fossil fuels, wood, and using pesticides. They contain nitrates, sulfates, organic chemicals, metals, soil and dust particles, as well as pollen fragments and mold spores. There is a significant association between exposure to PM2.5 particles and premature death from heart or lung disease. They also can increase the risk of heart attacks, asthma attacks and bronchitis. What are the environmental standards for PM2.5 particles? Different countries have different standards. In 2009, Japan declared that the annual average concentration of PM2.5 particles in air must be less than 15 micrograms per cubic meter, and that the daily average concentration must be less than 35 micrograms/cu. meter. In the United States, the annual and daily standards are the same as Japan’s. In the European Union, however, new PM2.5 regulations were put into force in 2010 that limit the annual mean concentration to 25 micrograms per cubic meter, with no daily standard. What about China? China’s national standard for PM2.5 is 75 micrograms per cu. meter daily and the government is aiming to establish an average of 35 micrograms annually. In heavily polluted Beijing, which far exceeds these levels, efforts are under way to reduce annual PM2.5 concentrations to 60 micrograms per cu. meter by 2015 and 50 micrograms by 2020 in order to meet the national standard by 2030. On Jan. 12, Beijing recorded PM2.5 levels of more than 900 micrograms/cu. meter. What effect has China’s pollution had on Japan? So far, western Japan has taken the brunt of the pollution. Fukuoka has reported that PM2.5 levels exceeded the daily maximum of 35 micrograms/cu. meter on three days in January. Western Honshu, including Hiroshima, Okayama and the Kansai region, also saw raised PM2.5 levels last month. In late January, parts of the city of Osaka logged a daily average of 63 micrograms and Kobe saw 41 micrograms. The Tokai and Hokuriku regions have also reported fairly high PM2.5 levels, as has the Tokyo metropolis. Chinese pollution in Japan is hardly a new phenomenon. Why is it now suddenly an issue? Attention is higher partly because of the severity of the cloud thoroughly engulfing Beijing this time. There is also more information on what’s happening now since the Chinese have recently stepped up their PM2.5 monitoring efforts. But in western Japan, many people believe attention is high because the smog has finally reached Tokyo, drawing the attention of national politicians and the media, unlike past instances where Chinese smog was restricted mostly to Kyushu and western Honshu, How is Japan attempting to deal with the problem? PM2.5 concentrations are likely to remain high going into March, just when the pollen season hits, the government warns. But there is little China’s neighbors can do besides monitor the air quality and issue public health advisories. At the same time, howver, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government is sending out contradictory messages on the issue. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters last week that the Environment Ministry would conduct an investigation yet was quick to add that “no immediate effects” on health were likely — at least at this point. Media pundits, however, noted that this Japanese expression was exactly the one used by the government when the Fukushima nuclear crisis erupted, and was unlikely to reassure the public.",

    "source": "Sales surge for men's fashion magazines <eos> An unexpected surge in sales of fashion magazines aimed at men in their 30s and 40s has taken the magazine industry by surprise. Bucking the general downward trend in sales for print magazines, titles like Leon have been getting snapped up by style-conscious guys over the past two years. According to the National Publication Association’ s Publishing Research Institute, sales of men’s magazines for the 30-40 age bracket began to rise around 2010. Sales of these magazines were up a whopping 38.3% from Jan. to Nov. in 2012 compared to the same period the previous year, climbing from 2.66 million copies sold in 2011 to 3.68 in 2012. Just five magazines fit into this niche market, with Leon taking the largest slice of the market share, accounting for a third of sales. The other magazines are Oceans , Uomo , Men’s Ex , and 2nd . Though Leon was responsible for creating the concept of the “ choi waru oyaji ” — which roughly translates as “bad-ass middle-aged dude” — personified by fashionable middle-aged guys like Italian heartthrob Panzetta Girolamo , this does not appear to have been the trigger for the trend. It’s more likely that the recent women’s magazine concept of the “ ikedan ,” or cool husband, has inspired women to buy men’s magazines for their husbands in an effort to get them to improve their appearance. For single men in their 30s and 40s, it may have been the explosion in en masse dating activities, such as machi kon events, that drove them to the magazine racks for tips on sharpening up their looks, making them better equipped to duel it out with younger, more fashionable rivals. According to J-Cast , these guys aren’t a bunch of aging rams dressed up as lamb, they’re simply men who would like to take care of their looks, whether to score a date or simply to score brownie points with the wife. The trend has, of course, had a positive impact on the clothing industry. Yano Research Institute reports that in 2011, sales for menswear (including suits, western clothing, and accessories) were up 2% on the previous year. Meanwhile, the Japan Department Stores Association reported a 1.7% rise in the sale of men’s suits in 2011 compared to the previous year. Furthermore, the men’s department of Isetan in Shinjuku reported that sales of suits and western clothes were up 2% for the period between April and September in 2012. The growing market has inspired Hankyu department store, which previously concentrated on women’s clothing, to open up Hankyu Men’s Tokyo in Yurakucho in Oct 2011. Since then, they’ve clocked in impressive sales of over 12 billion yen. We expect to see other department stores follow their lead.",

    "source": "More businesses admit misrepresenting menu items <eos> Major department store chains Takashimaya Co. and Daimaru Matsuzakaya Department Stores Co. separately said Tuesday that some of their restaurants and stores misrepresented items on their menus, becoming the latest in a string of companies to own up to food fraud. Takashimaya said the misrepresentations involved 62 menu items at five of its department stores and a shopping center, including those in Tokyo’s Nihonbashi and Shinjuku districts, Yokohama, and the city of Okayama. Mislabeled items included black tiger shrimp passed off as Japanese “kuruma” shrimp and “steak” that was actually processed meat with beef fat added. Separately, Daimaru Matsuzakaya announced the same day that “osechi” traditional boxed food for New Year’s it sold last year in Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures actually contained black tiger shrimp labeled as kuruma shrimp. At a news conference in Tokyo, Yutaka Masuyama, a Takashimaya executive, apologized “from the bottom of my heart” for misrepresenting the ingredients but denied it was intentional, claiming it was due to “lack of proper attention, and that’s what we need to remedy.” Takashimaya will refund customers confirmed to have consumed the food. The incident follows recent revelations of false menu descriptions across the country, involving Hankyu Hanshin Hotels Co., the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Osaka, which is under the umbrella of Hankyu Hanshin Holdings Inc., and the Renaissance Sapporo Hotel in Hokkaido. Masuyama said the black tiger shrimp labeled as kuruma shrimp resulted from staff failing to change the package labels after the latter ingredient was replaced with the former in sold products. “It slipped their mind,” said Masuyama. “The price tag was lowered, and there was no intention on our part to make extra money out of this.” The company also has admitted to using processed meat without properly labeling it even though the staff actually knew it was, but Masuyama said they “didn’t know doing so was necessary.” Later in the day, more businesses spilled the beans. Tokyu Hotels Co. reported false labeling of shrimp and beef steak at restaurants and banquet halls at 20 of its hotels. Hotel Keihan Co. said Hotel Keihan Universal Tower and two others in Osaka among its hotels in Japan failed to authentically describe steak made from processed meat with added beef fat. Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise, an aquarium, reported that its restaurant had sold processed meat with beef fat as steak.",

One item, Vannamei shrimp, was falsely touted as more upmarket Shiba shrimp.

    "source": "Bachelet tops Chile presidential vote, but fails to avoid runoff <eos> SANTIAGO - Michelle Bachelet won nearly twice as many votes as her closest rival in Chile’s presidential election Sunday, but she fell short of the outright majority needed to avoid a Dec. 15 runoff. With more than 92 percent of votes counted, the moderate socialist Bachelet had nearly 47 percent, to 25 percent for conservative Evelyn Matthei. Seven other candidates trailed far behind. Bachelet predicted she would win big in the second round and push forward major social reforms. “We’re going to have a decisive and strong victory that backs up the transformation program that we have been building,” she said. Matthei’s campaign celebrated getting another try at Bachelet, this time in a one-on-one race. “Going into a second round is certainly a triumph,” an exultant Matthei told supporters. Bachelet, 62, left office with an 84 percent approval rating after her 2006-10 presidency despite failing then to bring about major changes in society. This time, she has taken up the cause of protesters, vowing to revamp the constitution, raise corporate taxes to fund an education overhaul and reduce the wealth gap. But Bachelet’s center-left New Majority coalition failed Sunday to win the supermajorities in Congress needed to make those changes. Matthei, 60, an outspoken former labor minister, says Chile must continue business-friendly policies she credited for fast growth and low unemployment under center-right President Sebastian Pinera. She favors funding programs through improved economic growth, not by raising taxes. Bachelet and Matthei were childhood friends and neighbors, but found themselves on opposite sides after Chile’s 1973 military coup, when Matthei’s father ran the military school where Gen. Alberto Bachelet was tortured to death for remaining loyal to ousted President Salvador Allende. Both families have said Gen. Matthei had no direct involvement in Bachelet’s father’s death and the two women have remained cordial over the years while they rose through political ranks on the right and left. Chile is the world’s top copper producer, and its fast-growing economy, low unemployment and stable democracy are the envy of Latin America. But millions of Chileans have taken to the streets in recent years, venting frustration over the huge gap between rich and poor and the country’s chronically underfunded education system. Many voters blame free-market policies imposed during Gen. Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship for keeping wealth and power in very few hands. He sold off water services, undid land reforms, privatized pensions, cut wages and slashed trade barriers. Chile’s schools also were free before Pinochet pushed privatization and ended central control and funding of primary and secondary schools. “I’m voting for the first time in my life,” said Alvaro Torres, a 32-year-old warehouse worker casting his ballot at a school in the wealthy Santiago neighborhood of Las Condes. “I voted for Bachelet because she represents change. I hope change comes, especially in education.” “I voted for Evelyn Matthei because this is an historic moment and we need someone like her,” said Norma Sunkel, a 64-year-old sociologist. “I hope that she’ll force a runoff, but I have to admit that it’s very hard that she’ll win the presidency.” This was Chile’s first election after making voter registration automatic, increasing the rolls from 8.2 million to 13.5 million. But the new system also eliminated penalties for not voting. Pinera said late Sunday that he was sorry turnout was so low, with 44 percent of registered voters staying at home. With all 120 seats in the lower House of Congress and 20 of 38 Senate seats at stake, the low turnout probably didn’t help Bachelet’s efforts to gain super-majorities for her New Majority coalition. Under electoral rules imposed by Pinochet to frustrate change, the losing party gets half the seats in each region if the winning party fails to secure more than two-thirds of the votes. The dictatorship-era rules also require voting majorities in Congress of 57 percent for educational reform, 60 percent for electoral reform and nearly 67 percent for constitutional changes. But with most of the votes counted, Bachelet’s coalition had 51 percent in the Senate and 48 percent in the lower chamber. “You almost feel sorry for her because she’s going to be stuck between the future and the past,” said Peter Siavelis, a political science professor at Wake Forest University and author of “Democratic Chile: The Politics and Policies of a Historic Coalition.” “There all these demands in the streets for constitutional reform, but she’s facing a Congress that’s going to be elected by the binominal elections system,” Siavelis said. “There’s not going to be a majority there. So the influence of the dictatorship is going to impact on her reforms.”",

By offering objects for sale related to a particular hobby or interest, the concept of the new store, which opened its doors on Nov. 2, is to sell not only books, but also a new lifestyle and, of course, to maximize profits. Make no mistake, though. The lifestyle being hawked here is a far cry from the tony Daikanyama T-Site. Catering to a more suburban and middle-class set, the store is divided into seven zones: cookery, interior decorating, beauty, kids, business, the arts and travel. In the cookery zone, cooking utensils and tableware are laid out next to cookbooks and in-store cookery demonstrations should further whet consumer’s appetite for purchasing more than just a recipe book. As more entertainment content — be it books, DVDs or games — becomes digitized and downloadable, could this mark the final chapter of the bookstores? The writing is on the brick-and-mortar wall.",

    "source": "U.S. bombers cross China's claimed air defense zone <eos> NEW YORK - Days after China asserted greater military control over a swath of the East China Sea to bolster claims to a cluster of disputed islands, the U.S. defied the move Tuesday as it flew two B-52 bombers through the area. The U.S. said what it described as a training mission was not flown to respond to China’s latest military maneuver, yet the dramatic flights made clear that the U.S. will not recognize the new territorial claims that Beijing laid out over the weekend. The two unarmed U.S. B-52 bombers took off from their home base in Guam and flew through China’s newly designated air defense zone, then returned to base, U.S. officials said. The bombers were in the zone for less than an hour, thundering across the Pacific skies during midday there, the officials said, adding that the aircraft encountered no problems. While the U.S. insisted the training mission was long-planned, it came just days after China issued a map and a new set of rules governing the zone, which includes a cluster of islands that are controlled by Japan but claimed by Beijing. U.S. officials would not publicly acknowledge the flights on Tuesday, but State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said China’s move appeared to be an attempt to change the status quo in the East China Sea. “This will raise regional tensions and increase the risk of miscalculation, confrontation and accidents,” she told reporters. China said Saturday that all aircraft entering the new air defense zone must notify Chinese authorities and are subject to emergency military measures if they do not identify themselves or obey Beijing’s orders. U.S. officials, however, said they have received no reaction to the bomber flights from the Chinese. The bomber mission underscores Washington’s immediate rejection of China’s new rules. The U.S., which has hundreds of military aircraft based in the region, has said it has zero intention of complying. Japan likewise has called the zone invalid, unenforceable and dangerous, while Taiwan and South Korea, both close to the U.S., also rejected it. White House spokesman Josh Earnest would not specifically comment Tuesday on the military flights. “It continues to be our view that the policy announced by the Chinese over weekend is unnecessarily inflammatory and has a destabilizing impact on the region,” he told reporters traveling with Obama in Los Angeles. China’s move to further assert its territorial claims over the islands is not expected to immediately spark confrontations with foreign aircraft. Yet it fits a pattern of putting teeth behind China’s claims and could potentially lead to dangerous encounters depending on how vigorously China enforces it — and how cautious it is when intercepting aircraft from Japan, the U.S. and other countries. While enforcement is expected to start slowly, Beijing has a record of playing the long game, and analysts say they anticipate a gradual scaling up of activity. The declaration seems to have flopped as a foreign policy gambit. Analysts say Beijing may have miscalculated the forcefulness and speed with which its neighbors rejected its demands. At least in the short term, the move undermines Beijing’s drive for regional influence, said Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It doesn’t serve Chinese interests to have tensions with so many neighbors simultaneously,” she said. Denny Roy, a security expert at the East-West Center in Hawaii, said China’s enforcement will likely be mostly rhetorical at first. “The Chinese can now start counting and reporting what they call Japanese violations, while arguing that the Chinese side has shown great restraint by not exercising what they will call China’s right to shoot, and arguing further that China cannot be so patient indefinitely,” Roy said. China also faces practical difficulties deriving from gaps in its air-to-air refueling and early warning and control capabilities, presenting challenges in both detecting foreign aircraft and keeping its planes in the air, according to Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at Flightglobal magazine in Singapore. Despite that, Beijing has shown no sign of backing down, just as it has continued to aggressively enforce its island claims in the South China Sea over the strong protests from its neighbors. Tensions remain high with Tokyo over islands in the East China Sea called Senkaku by Japan and Daioyu by China. Beijing was incensed by Japan’s September 2012 move to nationalize the chain, and Diaoyutai by Taiwan, which also claims them. Since then, Chinese and Japanese coast guard ships have regularly confronted each other in surrounding waters. Japan further angered Beijing last month by threatening to shoot down unmanned Chinese drones that Beijing says it plans to send on surveillance missions over the islands. Beijing’s move was greeted rapturously by hard-line Chinese nationalists, underscoring Beijing’s need to assuage the most vocal facet of domestic public opinion. Strategically, it also serves to keep the island controversy alive in service of Beijing’s goal of forcing Tokyo to accept that the islands are in dispute — a possible first step to joint administration or unilateral Chinese control over them. Beijing was also responding in kind to Japan’s strict enforcement of its own air defense zone in the East China Sea, said Dennis Blasko, an Asia analyst at think tank CNA’s China Security Affairs Group and a former army attache in Beijing. The Japanese zone, in place since the 1960s, overlaps extensively with the newly announced Chinese zone. Japan, which keeps a public record of all foreign incursions into its zone, actually extended it westward by 14 miles (22.5 km) in May.",

    "source": "Think caviar but brace for caveat <eos> In one of the most memorable scenes of the late, and sorely missed, Juzo Itami’s classic 1985 film “Tampopo” (“Dandelion”), Japanese businessmen enter a French restaurant. Confused by the exotic items on the menu, the elderly members of the party stick to what they know: sole meuniere, consomme soup and Heineken beer. The youngest member of the group, however, breaks the harmony by ordering quenelle, Boudin-style, like they serve it at the Taillevent restaurant in Paris, escargot wrapped in pastry with a fond de veau sauce, and an apple and walnut salad. The waiter is thrilled somebody in the room truly knows fine food, while his older colleagues fume with anger and embarrassment. Nearly three decades later, that scene looks less like a parody of high-end diners ignorant of gourmet food and more, as the recent food misrepresentation scandal shows, as a prescient profile of today’s finicky foodie who reads the menu carefully and knows which South African wine goes best with the Kobe beef or Okinawan pork. The revelation in October that eight hotels belonging to the Hankyu Hanshin group in Osaka, as well as the Ritz Carlton Osaka, had mislabeled about 50 food items on the menus of nearly two dozen restaurants and banquet halls turned out to be the tip of a very large iceberg. To date, in addition to Osaka-area hotel restaurants, a Tokyo Disneyland hotel and the Hyatt Regency Tokyo are just two of the many prominent names that have gotten caught up in the scandal. While the president of Hankyu Hanshin Hotels resigned to take responsibility for, among other things, claiming frozen fish as fresh and regular onions as a famed Kyoto variety, it was the Ritz Carlton Osaka’s president who created outrage when he said he originally thought there was no reason to announce one of the restaurants in his hotel was doing such things as using a different kind of shrimp than the one on the menu. Talentless “tarento” expressed shock that the famed Ritz was putting on its customers. Reporters scrutinized leather-bound menus of other Michelin-starred restaurants with a fine-toothed comb for lies, distortions, omissions and exaggerations. Suddenly, everybody was a food critic. Upscale Tokyo pundits assigned blame to the usual suspects — a sensationalist media, a few greedy corporations, and poor quality control by the line cooks. One restaurant industry source, speaking to the Asahi Shimbun, blamed the problem at the Ritz on a translation error. In Osaka, however, talk centered on the traditionally tightfisted, bargain-hunter culture of the natives toward spending money in a manner Tokyoites considered normal, even proper. The cost of living is 15 to 20 percent cheaper in Osaka than in Tokyo. Historically, Osakans, no matter their income level, have always been vocal in their demands for the lowest possible price for everything, especially in the service industry, regardless if certain sectors of it may be considered “high-end” elsewhere. This means even highly respected Osaka restaurants and hotels must go to extraordinary lengths to trim costs. Combine that with weak consumer protection laws and a hesitancy to question the waiter’s recommendation and you have an atmosphere ripe for abuse by those writing today’s specials on the chalkboard— at least until somebody in the know complains, is rebuffed by management and decides to blow the whistle. The young protagonist in “Tampopo” may have been showing off. But he instinctively understood the ancient concept of caveat emptor. As the food labeling scandal shows, today’s customers need to also heed the term’s gourmet cousin, which might be rendered as “caviar emptor.”",

    "source": "Japan meets Kyoto goal via credit buys <eos> WARSAW - Using the fiscal 1990 baseline, Japan achieved an 8.2 percent cut in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fiscal 2008 to 2012, meeting a 6 percent target under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming, government sources said Saturday. The preliminary figure shows Tokyo managed to fulfill its obligation during the first commitment period under the Kyoto pact due to a plunge in emissions in fiscal 2009 caused by a global financial crisis as well as forest absorption and the country’s purchase of emissions credits from overseas, the sources said. Environment Minister Nobuteru Ishihara is set to announce the nation’s achievement of the 6 percent cut target at the ongoing U.N. climate talks in Warsaw, they said. But greenhouse gas emissions in Japan have been rising since the 2011 Fukushima disaster, which left most of Japan’s nuclear plants offline and revived thermal power generation. Tokyo has decided not to join an eight-year second commitment period from 2013 for the Kyoto Protocol, saying the framework lacks effectiveness as major gas-emitting countries such as the United States and China are not part of the reduction efforts. On Friday, Tokyo set a new target of slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 3.8 percent in fiscal 2020 from fiscal 2005 levels, assuming nuclear power plants in the country remain offline. But the revised goal has immediately drawn criticism as it represents an rise of about 3 percent in emissions from the Kyoto Protocol base year of fiscal 1990.",

    "source": "Consumer body wants local-level food scrutiny <eos> Responding to recent food frauds committed by hotel and department store operators, the Consumer Affairs Agency is aiming to amend the products labeling law to let prefectures issue improvement orders to businesses that violate the law, government sources said Monday. Under the existing Act Against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations, only the Consumer Affairs Agency has the authority to order firms to stop misrepresenting items on their menus or to take steps to prevent further violations. But in practice, it is not possible for the agency to keep tabs on all the eateries and restaurants nationwide. The recent revelations of misrepresentations have triggered calls from the ruling bloc and prefectural and municipal governments to give local governments more authority. As things now stand, prefectural governments are allowed to inspect companies and instruct those linked to food fraud to stop breaking the law, or ask the Consumer Affairs Agency to issue orders. But the local governments have no legal grounds to issue such orders themselves. The Act Against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations prohibits attempts to mislead consumers by representing products as more expensive or better than they actually are. Violators are issued improvement orders, which if they fail to heed could result in imprisonment of up to two years or a fine not to exceed ¥3 million. The Consumer agency has 50 staffers who deal with issues related to the labeling law. However, since the agency’s establishment in September 2009, only four firms caught mislabeling food have been ordered to stop. Food fraud cases are expected to soar if local governments are authorized to go after violators.",

    "source": "Firms tap apps that 'augment reality' <eos> Smartphone applications featuring “augmented reality” are being used by an increasing number of companies to promote their products. Ikea Japan K.K., the Japanese arm of the Swedish furnishing giant, launched a service in August that gives customers a virtual preview of how a piece of furniture will look in their home, with the help of a printed catalog, a smartphone or tablet and a mobile app. Customers first open the catalog at the selected product page and point the smartphone or tablet camera at a cross at the bottom of the page. This gives them access to augmented reality mode. Next, they close the catalog and place it on the spot where they intend to place the new piece of furniture. A virtual image of the selected sofa, bed or other furniture item will then be shown on the device’s screen with the room in the background. Customers can reposition the virtual furniture simply by touching the screen. About 90 kinds of furniture items can be viewed via augmented reality, which helps customers avoid buying the wrong size, shape or color by enabling them to picture the product in place first. “We want customers to know that purchasing furniture is easy and enjoyable too,” said Yuki Murata of Ikea Japan. A 30-year-old man who was visiting the Ikea outlet in Funabashi, Chiba Prefecture, along with his wife, said, “It is always a challenge to go and buy furniture, but by using this app we can see how it looks at home before actually coming to the store.” In another example, this winter, Sanrio Co. is selling two kinds of greeting cards, at ¥483 each, using augmented reality technology. It is the first time for the Tokyo-based character goods maker to sell the cards. One of the cards features four Santa Clauses that pop up when the card is opened. When the recipient holds a smartphone or tablet over the card, 11 Santa Clauses appear on screen, playing musical instruments. In the other card, Sanrio’s popular character Hello Kitty dances on the device screen and the recipient can even be in a photograph with Kitty. “We believe the cards combine the warmth of handwritten letters and the latest information technology,” said Shingo Yasutomo, a Sanrio official who developed them. Publishing firms also seem interested in products using the technology. Tokyo Shoseki Co. in August published a picture book for ¥1,995 about 33 species of animals at Asahiyama Zoo, a popular tourist draw located in Asahikawa, Hokkaido. By overlaying a smartphone on the book, a reader can view a virtual image of a bear swimming on the screen or a magnified image of the rarely seen cheek teeth of the Yezo deer. An official at Tokyo Shoseki said sales of the book are on the increase and the company has received favorable comments from readers, one of whom said, “It’s like being at the zoo.” Augmented reality technology is also used by many tourist spots and museums to offer visitors digital guidance, as well as in product ads on vending machines.",

    "source": "Hotel Okura latest to own up to fraudulent menus <eos> Hotel Okura on Thursday became the latest in a seemingly endless string of established hotels and department stores to admit to misrepresenting the items on its restaurant menus. Hotel Okura Co., the operator of the landmark hotel in central Tokyo and others nationwide, said 13 hotels and three restaurants under its wing had misrepresented 235 menu items. According to the hotel chain, a total of 386,000 dishes stemming from false menu descriptions, amounting to ¥870 million, had been sold since 2007. Separately, JAL Hotels Co., a unit of Hotel Okura, reported similar menu misrepresentations at its 13 hotels that amounted to 130,000 dishes worth ¥200 million since 2006. Hotel JAL City Tamachi Tokyo in Minato Ward, for example, served barnacle rock shell as premium “awabi” abalone. Also served was shark fin soup using fins made of artificial ingredients. Okura’s announcement came just a day after Japan’s three leading department stores — Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd., Sogo & Seibu Co. and Odakyu Department Store Co. — admitted using ingredients different from those listed on their menus. Though all three claimed the food fraud was committed by tenants, they’ve nonetheless taken heat for lack of oversight. Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings said that 14 restaurants in its group nationwide served misrepresented items. The fraud involved 52 menu items at eight department stores and one shopping mall, included the mislabeling of Vannamei shrimp as more expensive Shiba shrimp and processed beef as steak, Isetan Mitsukoshi said. In other cases, the origin of the food was false, such as pork raised in Iwate Prefecture being sold as from Miyazaki, and chestnuts from China baked into cakes labeled from Europe. Isetan Mitsukoshi said it will give refunds for those items. Meanwhile, Sogo & Seibu Co. admitted to misrepresenting 13 items at seven restaurants in its group stores nationwide. At a Sogo Tokushima restaurant in Tokushima Prefecture, for example, Awa beef, a local delicacy, was listed on the menu, though the beef was in fact from Kagoshima Prefecture. Odakyu Department Store Co. also acknowledged the same day that it had falsely represented dishes, including a product that claimed to contain prawns, not the tiger shrimp it actually did. “It’s the department stores’ responsibility to check how their tenants are managing food. Otherwise, they should not let (those restaurants) use their space,” said Yasuko Kono, director general of the National Liaison Committee of Consumer’s Organization. “The department store business, after all, is built on trust. And as a consumer, I am fuming by knowing the reality.” The Consumer Affairs Agency is studying whether the food fraud falls under the scope of the competition and policy law, which forbids mislabeling of any product, an agency official said. If it determines there were violations, it will order those companies to take preventive steps toensure they never happen again. Regardless of what the agency decides, the industries must stick to their own rules and guidelines to regain consumer trust, Kono said. “They are convicted criminals. They are professionals and there is no way they couldn’t have realized (the items were mislabeled). Their management culture has a huge problem and it needs to be changed,” Kono said. She also stressed that Japan needs to establish systems to track ingredients to their source. “At the moment, there is almost no such tracking system in Japan,” she said. The Consumer Affairs Agency instructed the hotel industry on Wednesday to take steps to correct its conduct. The agency handed written requests to representatives of the Japan Hotel Association and two other hotel industry groups. The groups received explanations of the law for preventing misleading representations of goods and services, and were shown past instances of menu descriptions found to violate regulations. The agency is currently discussing handing out similar requests to department stores, an official said. Companies implicated in the scandal include Prince Hotels Inc., Hankyu Hanshin Hotels Co., the Ritz-Carlton Osaka and department store operator Takashimaya Co. Information from Kyodo added",

    "source": "The secret of keeping official secrets secret <eos> “He that would keep a secret must keep it secret that he hath a secret to keep,” says Sir Humphrey Appleby, permanent secretary to the Department of Administrative Affairs, a fictitious branch of the British government. He is one of the main characters in the highly acclaimed 1980s BBC television series “Yes Minister” and its equally phenomenal sequel, “Yes Prime Minister.” Sir Humphrey’s axiom would surely be readily shared by current real-life Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as he bulldozes his bill for the protection of special official secrets through parliament. The bill would meet with Sir Humphrey’s high approval not least because it keeps secret what secrets it deems especially secret. People who supposedly violate the regulations set down by the legislation would never be sure what secret it was that they failed to keep secret. Civil servants would become even more secretive than they already are because they fear a potential 10-year imprisonment for divulging secrets whose degree of secrecy they are secretly never quite sure of. Their unwritten code of secret conduct would ultimately be: “When in doubt, keep secret.” Such a mindset would also be very much after Sir Humphrey’s own heart. Not only the civil service but ordinary citizens would also walk in fear of breaking the law whose notions of secrecy are shrouded in secrecy. The whole nation would turn into a secret society in which people’s lips are sealed because they do not know what secrets they may be unwittingly sharing with each other. The foregoing words of Sir Humphrey’s appear in an episode called “A Question of Loyalty” in the “Yes Minister” series. Sir Humphrey’s political master, Jim Hacker, is minister for administrative affairs at that point. By a quirk of fate and some astute political moves Hacker goes on to become prime minister. Sir Humphrey also moves up to the top of the administrative ladder and joins Hacker as chief secretary to the Cabinet. Enemies in friendly disguise as much as friends in seeming hostility, the two of them come up against some intriguing issues of secrecy in their respective top jobs in government. “Official Secrets” is an episode that crops up about two-thirds of the way into the prime ministerial series. Clearly neither fact nor fiction concerning government and politics can proceed without touching on the theme of secrecy. On this occasion, an increasingly power-conscious Prime Minister Hacker tries to suppress the publication of a chapter of his predecessor’s memoirs because it says a lot of very unkind things about Hacker’s conduct when he was still in charge of the Department of Administrative Affairs. The solicitor-general, who is the top civil servant in charge of legal interpretation, complains that the chapter cannot be suppressed on grounds of official secrecy because the criticisms against Hacker, while possibly libelous, are not a security risk. The outburst indicates how easily the prime ministerial job can go to somebody’s head. Hacker, as political head of government, now considers himself leader of the nation, whereas the government is actually there to serve the nation and not the other way around. This is the misunderstanding of a weak mind with strong delusions. To the owner of such a mind and such delusions, every nasty thing that is said against them becomes actionable as a breach of official secrecy. Freedom of speech would disappear from the radar screen of democracy. It could just as easily happen in real life as well as in television.

    "source": "Japan: The new Uzbekistan of press freedom in Asia <eos> If you’re living in Japan, you may be surprised to know that your right to know has been replaced by the right to remain silent. Shhh … don’t protest. It’s practically a done deal. The first rule of the pending state secrets bill is that a secret is a secret. The second rule is that anyone who leaks a secret and/or a reporter who makes it public via a published report or broadcast can face up to 10 years in prison. The third rule is that there are no rules as to which government agencies can declare information to be a state secret and no checks on them to determine that they don’t abuse the privilege; even defunct agencies can rule their information to be secret. The fourth rule is that anything pertaining to nuclear energy is a state secret, which means there will no longer be any problems with nuclear power in this country because we won’t know anything about it. And what we don’t know can’t hurt us. The right to know has now officially been superseded by the right of the government to make sure you don’t know what they don’t want you to know. Welcome to the new Dark Ages of Japan, brought to you by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party, Komeito and Your Party. If the economy and the actions of the government and its politicians seemed opaque up to now, the ruling bloc is making sure that it’s very solid obsidian. Every major news organization in Japan opposes the bill. Last week, thousands of ordinary citizens took to the street to protest the proposed legislation. The LDP — ever sensitive to the will of the people — took decisive action to address the issue last Tuesday. A debate was held in the morning and televised by state broadcaster NHK. As soon as NHK cut off the broadcast, the LDP ended the debate and rammed the bill through the Lower House. Democracy in action. Only the Upper House remains. The law has been compared to the pre-World War II Peace Preservation Law, which was used to arrest and jail any individual who opposed the government party line. “Japan already has a very weak freedom of information act which this will cripple,” said Yutaka Saito, a member of the Japan In-House Lawyers Association task force. “The bill takes everything bad about national security laws in the U.S. and then removes all the safeguards and checks.” According to one survey, more than 80 percent of the public feels that the new law will be misused by the government to coverup scandals, corruption and troubling information. That mistrust in the government is well founded: the Minamata disease coverup on behalf of corporate interests in the ’60s; the HIV-tainted blood scandal in the ’90s; Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s moves to bury a whistle-blower report on nuclear safety problems at Fukushima No. 1 and No. 2 nuclear power plants in 2000. Abe has assured us that the regulations for the bill clearly state that a third party organization should be put in place to keep checks on the system. Should . Should is an interesting word. You should brush your teeth. You should pay your taxes. You should believe Prime Minister Abe when he tells that he doesn’t know notorious yakuza financier Icchu Nagamoto — even though he had his photo taken with him in 2008 . We should believe Abe and yet I don’t. Japan should have a society where people have a right to know what their government is doing and where freedom of the press is guaranteed. Abe’s suggestion that there should be oversight does not mean that there will be. And judging by recent history, even if a token oversight committee is created, it will be about as effective as protecting the public’s right to know as the Nuclear Industrial Safety Agency was in preventing a triple nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant. On Nov. 27, Reporters Without Borders condemned the legislation cogently. “How can the government respond to growing demands for transparency from a public outraged by the consequences of the Fukushima nuclear accident if it enacts a law that gives it a free hand to classify any information considered too sensitive as a ‘state secret’?” the organization said. “By imposing heavy penalties on those who obtain classified information . . . and then publish it, Parliament is making investigative journalism illegal, and is trampling on the fundamental principles of the confidentiality of journalists’ sources and ‘public interest.’ ” Reporters Without Borders also noted that Japan’s ranking in the press freedom index had taken a record fall of 31 places from its position in 2012 to a new low of 53 out of 179 countries. If the state secrets law is passed, Japan’s press freedom ranking next year is expected to sink to nearly Uzbekistan or China levels. Welcome to the land of the setting sun. Let’s see how much darker it will get.",

The government has yet to decide which university will get to open the medical department. The new facility will be required to train doctors capable of contributing to the recovery of Tohoku by studying medical therapies to assist those suffering as a result of the disasters. It will also be urged to establish a scholarship for students who commit to working in the region after graduating from university, the ministry said. The university chosen to host the medical department will be banned from recruiting as faculty members doctors and nurses from nearby areas so as not to disrupt the regional health care infrastructure.

The Emperor has graciously offered the use of an extensive lot in that locality for that purpose. The park will be constructed with the pond at Inokashira as its center, extending to all directions. It will be only a few minutes’ walk from Kichijoji Station on the Central Railway Line about five miles west of Shinjuku. The pond is large enough to afford the pleasure of rowing boats. Almost the entire lot is under the shade of luxuriant trees. The Imperial gift to the park in extensive wooded land will make it one of the greatest attractions for pleasure-seeking persons of the capital. 75 YEARS AGO Sunday, Dec. 21, 1938 Captain details mine sweeping on Yangtze Captain Tokuji Mori, former Commander of the Japanese fleet on the Yangtze River, returned to Tokyo Monday to assume his office as the Chief of Staff in the Auxiliary Naval Station at Ominato. Spending nearly six months in sweeping numerous submarine mines, his fleet reduced the enemy’s strategic positions along the river one after another and made a triumphant entry into Hankow (Hankou) on October 26. Captain Mori had experience in sweeping mines in the Dardanelles in the Mediterranean as an officer of the Japanese destroyer Kashiwa during the World War. Captain Mori told the press: “I had made notes on the number of mines swept away until we approached Kiukiang (Jiujiang), but there were so many there that I became tired of this task. It was indeed a hard task to find the mines. “Encouraged by the nation’s support behind the guns, we were all in high spirits during the fight, however. Surrounded by the enemy’s mines and fortress cannons, we could not advance even a single step for five days in front of Kiukiang. “An American gunboat and a British gunboat were quietly watching our struggling. And we shed tears of joy when we captured this most important strategic position of the enemy.” 50 YEARS AGO Wednesday, Dec. 18, 1963 Nation’s leaders eulogize Kennedy The nation’s leaders assembled at Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo Tuesday to express their deep mourning and sense of loss at the death of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. The memorial meeting, the first such public meeting held in Japan since Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on Nov. 22, was attended by more than 2,000 people of all ages and walks of life. The meeting, held under the joint sponsorship of a national committee organized for the memorial gathering and the America-Japan Society, began at 1:30 p.m. with the playing of national anthems of the two countries. After a minute of silent prayer, the gathering heard the nation’s political, business and religious leaders deliver messages of condolence. They all identified themselves with the ideals Kennedy stood for and pledged their efforts to participate in the continuation of his unfinished work. In both English and Japanese, American Ambassador to Japan Edwin O. Reischauer expressed thanks for the messages of condolence from the Japanese people and gave assurances that the work of the late president has been taken up by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In his message, Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda said the Japanese people must realize that they have both the duty and the responsibility to keep working for peace and social justice in honor of the soul of the late U.S. president. Socialist Chairman Jotaro Kawakami said that although his party was opposed to U. S. Government policy toward Japan, Kennedy’s death was to be regretted because he died at the hands of an enemy of democracy “just as our late Secretary General Inejiro Asanuma did.” Asanuma was assassinated by an ultra rightist three years ago while delivering a campaign speech on the same stage of the hall. The NHK Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of Wilhelm Loibner, played the second movement from Beethoven’s Symphony No. 3 and Schubert’s “Ave Maria,” the latter a favorite of the President. 25 YEARS AGO Friday, Dec. 16, 1988 Japan-U.S. visa pact goes into effect A Japanese-U.S. agreement exempting tourists and business people from visa requirements went into effect Thursday. U.S. Consulate, Japanese immigration and airline officials attended a ceremony at the Osaka International Airport to send off the first group of Japanese passengers to the United States. “This agreement will promote tourism between the two countries. And with greater exchanges will come greater mutual understanding,” said U.S. Consul General John R. Malott. Of the 300 passengers who left for the U.S. Thursday, 30 chose to go without visas. Japanese and American travelers, however, must fill out a visa waiver form, which is available from airlines, travel agents, embassies and consulates. The waiver is a considerably simplified version of the visa process, said Dennis Ortblad, who is in charge of the consulate’s visa section. Under the agreement, Japanese citizens carrying valid passports can enter the U.S. for holidays or business travel without visas. The agreement allows travelers to remain in the country for up to 90 days. No extensions of changes of status are permitted.",

    "source": "Secrets bill raises fears among nuclear foes <eos> OSAKA - In late 2005, U.S. government officials, invited by Japan, observed a counterterrorism drill at the Mihama nuclear plant in Fukui Prefecture and came away worried about the security situation at the complex. Some 2,000 police officers, firefighters, nuclear power officials, local authorities and residents were involved in the exercise, in which the plant comes under attack by foreign terrorists who entered the harbor by boat. The focus of much of the drill was on evacuating residents, but the U.S. officials were more concerned about what they felt were security gaps. This led Washington to push Tokyo to pay more attention to physically protecting the facilities. Today, as the Liberal Democratic Party-New Komeito ruling bloc prepares to enact a new state secrets law, the question of what happens to information about nuclear plant security is being batted about, especially in Kansai. Fukui Prefecture is home to 13 commercial reactors, all of which, before the recent shutdown, provided power to distant Osaka and Hyogo prefectures, as well as neighboring Kyoto and Shiga. It is also home to the Monju prototype fast-breeder reactor. Originally designed to burn plutonium, Monju has been idle for nearly two decades after a sodium leak from a cooling unit and the resulting fire on Dec. 8, 1995, made headlines, along with the attempt to cover it up. Video shot inside the plant by the operator showing the extent of the damage was initially hidden, leaving it to the prefecture to uncover the truth. “In 1995, Fukui Prefecture courageously entered the Monju fast-breeder reactor accident site and videotaped the damage, thus revealing the coverup undertaken by the owner/operator. Passage of the state secrets bill would inhibit or prevent local authorities from taking such action again,” said Kyoto-based anti-nuclear activist Aileen Mioko Smith. The government says the purpose of the secrets bill is to prevent damaging leaks of information vital to national defense and diplomacy, and to prevent spies and terrorists from acquiring such sensitive information. In a blog, Upper House Councilor Yosuke Isozaki of the LDP recently took a jab at people who are concerned that information related to nuclear power plants would be classified. “Under the basic law, information can be classified to prevent terrorism. This means information related to the investigation of terrorist activities. Even people who have just a little bit of knowledge about the law should instantly understand when they read the (secrets bill) that it doesn’t apply to nuclear power information,” Isozaki wrote. But that raises the fundamental question of who, exactly, gets to judge what constitutes a terrorist activity at a nuclear plant and how they would make decisions about classifying information based on that judgment. In late October, at a meeting of opposition lawmakers, Ken Hashiba of the Cabinet Office said at a public hearing on the bill that it was possible information related to the security of nuclear power facilities could become classified. This appeared to be a more general statement than Isozaki’s. For their part, many in the Kansai region and elsewhere remain concerned. “There have already been 359 instances where the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has used the excuse of protecting nuclear materials (to not release information) and 449 cases where the Nuclear Regulation Authority has designated documents as secret,” the daily Kyoto Shimbun said in a recent editorial. The paper warned there was lots of room for the government to expand the “terrorism-related” category to things like evacuation plans or the routes to be used when nuclear fuel is transported by land or sea, often through crowded municipalities. Anti-nuclear activists often keep track of fuel shipments to and from the Fukui plants. The worries in Kansai were heightened in early October when the Fukushima Prefectural Assembly warned it was possible that, under the guise of preventing terrorism, the government would use the new law to designate atomic plant problems or information that could protect residents as classified, especially in an emergency. “Because information from the System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information (SPEEDI) network was not appropriately disclosed (after the 3/11 quake), some of the residents in Namie were evacuated to an area with high radiation,” the assembly said in a statement, referring to one of the Fukushima Prefecture towns contaminated by radioactive fallout from the March 2011 core meltdowns at the Fukushima No. 1 power plant. The SPEEDI network is a series of monitoring stations around the country that sound the alarm when large amounts of radioactive material are emitted by power plants or other atomic facilities. In an emergency, METI, the NRA and local governments would be responsible for warning residents about dosage levels. Officially, however, local government heads in the Kansai region have yet to address the issue. Most remain focused not on the secrets bill or nuclear power itself, but on what they will have to do to deal with an emergency involving Fukui’s reactors. Shiga Prefecture recently simulated a nuclear accident at one of the Fukui plants and learned that there might not be enough fresh water in storage to cope with the loss of a fallout-tainted Lake Biwa, which provides drinking water for 14.5 million people. Other Kansai governments, however, are more concerned about a bigger question: how to coordinate a widespread evacuation. While the apparent lack of transparency on nuclear safety measures under the secrets bill has been widely discussed, receiving less attention is the question of whether ordinary citizens who are involved in anti-nuclear protests might be targeted and investigated under the new law, or whether the heads of local government that host reactors will find their demands for data on plant operations or costs blocked in the name of “terrorism.” “In the past, Japanese utilities cooperated with the police to identify, isolate and observe members of the Japanese Communist Party and their supporters. But most of these efforts at ideological discrimination were ruled to be in violation of the Constitution,” Fukui Prefectural Assemblyman Masao Sato of the JCP wrote on his official blog. Many nuclear power employees either belong to, or support, the JCP. They have often helped bring to light information about problems at the plants. Saito fears the new secrets bill will empower the police to crack down further on their efforts. “It’s clear that security information at nuclear power plant facilities will be classified as secret. But it’s also possible that under the pretext of doing a background check, the families and friends of nuclear plant workers will be tracked and the information gathered on them will be kept secret,” he said.",

    "source": "Bullet trains on a pro-nuclear curve <eos> OSAKA - In the debate over the future of nuclear power, which provided about a third of Japan’s electricity needs before the Fukushima disaster began in 2011, commentators for and against resuming its use have argued their case. Experts on both sides often rely on arguments couched in status-quo assumptions or general platitudes. Serious discussions are backed by mind-numbing details on endless PowerPoint slides, requiring the patience of Buddha to endure, let alone comprehend. But in the Kansai region, which relied on nuclear power for nearly half of its electricity before the three core meltdowns in March 2011, and in Fukui Prefecture, where 13 reactors supplied it, one reason for going back to nuclear requires neither a degree in economics nor nuclear engineering to understand. It’s just good old-fashioned pork-barrel politics. This involves the future of trains. Specifically, the future route of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Line, which, if all works out, will link Nagano with Osaka, via Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, sometime in the middle of the century. The question for Kansai’s nuclear industry, however, is whether the central government will ensure Fukui gets a good chunk of the route and whether it will run down the eastern or western side of Lake Biwa, in Shiga Prefecture, to get to Osaka. Three routes have been proposed, including one that would take bullet trains through southern Fukui, where the reactors are. Kansai’s leaders are well aware of how important the Hokuriku line will be to Fukui and strongly support extending it southwest to Osaka. But for economic reasons, they want it to go from Tsuruga to JR Maibara Station, on the eastern side of the lake. That means that it would bypass other towns in the southern part of Fukui that host reactors. The third proposed route would take the line along Lake Biwa’s western shore, keeping it in Shiga. Fukui’s pro-nuclear governor and the towns hosting its reactors want, of course, for the line to pass through their backyards so they can take advantage of the extra new passengers it would provide and lots of central government subsidies. What if Tokyo picks a different route? Well, although not required by law, local approval is a de facto condition for restarting idled reactors. If the shinkansen don’t pull into their stations with cash subsidies, or if the people don’t indirectly benefit from the line somehow, Kansai may find Fukui’s mayors and governor suddenly less cooperative about approving restarts. In the meantime, Toyama and Ishikawa prefectures are sending signals that the shinkansen project is related to nuclear power. At a meeting last week, the heads of the three prefectural assemblies agreed on extending it to Osaka and on restarting the reactors as soon as possible. At the end of the day, the financial concerns of Fukui and the Hokuriku region are going to influence Kansai’s energy policy. The Hokuriku Shinkansen Line is a major bargaining chip for Fukui, Kansai and the central government in reaching a deal on just how those concerns can be addressed.",

    "source": "In Thai capital, 852 schoolchildren set human Christmas tree record <eos> BANGKOK - Christmas is not a holiday in predominantly Buddhist Thailand, and its palm trees outnumber pines, but the country still set a world record with its holiday spirit. One of the country’s largest shopping malls arranged a publicity stunt involving 852 schoolchildren dressed in green and red hoodies to break the Guinness world record for the largest human Christmas tree. They outdid a German record of 672 participants in 2011. To the relief of parents, and the chagrin of a few teenagers, the children were not hoisted onto a human pyramid shaped like a conifer. It was more an exercise in crowd control, grouping the assembled 6- to 15-year-olds into a treelike formation on the ground. “I kind of thought we’d get to stand on each other’s shoulders,” said Nattakit Liewkulnattana, 13. Like most participants at the event, he doesn’t celebrate Christmas. He wasn’t sure whose birthday the holiday marks — “Santa Claus?” he asked — but was excited to take part in a world record, and maybe get something in return. “I want presents!” the teen said. All participants got to keep their hoodies. The record was set in 15 minutes, 29 seconds. Guinness World Records representative Fortuna Burke certified the feat, counting on a clicker as children filed onto an outdoor verandah at Siam Paragon mall, the event’s organizer. Once in place, the children waved as a drone flew overhead to capture aerial images. Although Christmas does not appear on Thai calendars and is a regular workday, hotels and shopping malls decorate starting in mid-November for what is a big shopping season during Thailand’s peak tourism months. Thais set a number of other off-beat records this year. On Valentine’s Day, a couple broke the record for the longest kiss —58 hours, 35 minutes and 58 seconds — while in February, nearly 4,483 participants swung hula hoops for seven minutes, a record for the most people dancing with hula hoops simultaneously in one place.",

    "source": "ADIZs common but China's is worrisome <eos> China’s announcement Saturday of its establishment of an air defense identification zone in the East China Sea that includes the Japan-controlled Senkaku islets has worsened already tense bilateral ties. From 10 a.m. Saturday, China said any aircraft entering the ADIZ must obey its rules or face “defensive emergency measures.” Japan does not recognize the new Chinese claim, and government officials have lodged a protest with Beijing and demanded an end to the zone. What exactly is an air defense identification zone, and how legitimate is a country’s claim? Here are some details about ADIZs: What is an ADIZ? Established beyond national airspace, the zone is a defensive perimeter to monitor incursions by suspicious aircraft. The zone gives the military time to determine whether a foreign aircraft approaching territorial airspace is friend or foe. Zones are set up according to a country’s domestic laws. Many countries have established ADIZs, including Japan and the United States. China had none until Saturday. Japan’s ADIZ was originally set up by the Occupation forces after World War II. Based on its contours, Japan established its own zone in 1969, according to the Defense Ministry. Because ADIZs are based on domestic law, Japan has no legal grounds for preventing China from establishing an ADIZ over the Senkakus, which it claims, as does Taiwan. Do foreign aircraft need permission to pass through a country’s ADIZ? Under international law, aircraft have the right to fly freely in airspace over the high seas, where ADIZs are usually set up, thus no permission is required. However, because the ADIZ is set up to prevent unknown aircraft from entering its territorial airspace, Japan requests flight plans for all foreign aircraft entering the zone if the intention is to continue flying toward Japanese territory. What happens if an aircraft enters Japan’s ADIZ without a flight plan? Fighter jets are scrambled if an unknown aircraft enters the zone without advance notice and is approaching Japanese territory. The Defense Ministry declined to give further details for reasons of national security. The Air Self-Defense Force scrambled jets 80 times between July and September in response to Chinese aircraft, according to the ministry. So what’s wrong with China setting up such a zone? Is it any different from Japan’s ADIZ? One thing is that China’s ADIZ includes Japanese territorial airspace over the Senkaku Islands and that it theoretically forces Japan to obey its rule when flying in the zone. In a statement issued Sunday, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida accused China of designating the airspace over the uninhabited islets as if it is China’s territorial airspace. Beijing is also violating the right to fly freely over the high seas, based on the guidelines it released Saturday, Katsunobu Kato, deputy chief Cabinet secretary, said Monday. While Japan only “requests” that foreign aircraft submit flight plans in advance if entering its ADIZ to approach its national airspace, China is demanding that all aircraft “must” report flight plans to the Chinese Foreign Ministry or the civil aviation administration of China, a ministry official said in Beijing. The Chinese demand affects even aircraft passing through the zone, heading away from Chinese territory, the official said. Foreign aircraft must also maintain radio communications and transmit transponder signals and registration ID clearly indicating its nationality, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. Aircraft that fail to obey face “defensive emergency measures” by China’s armed forces, it reported, details of which are unknown.",

    "source": "Has business blackballed the yakuza? Don't bank on it <eos> The Financial Services Agency (FSA) publicly spanked Mizuho Bank last month by slapping it with a “business improvement order” for letting Japan’s organized crime groups use its facilities. At least $2 million in illegal transactions were cited. Mizuho had been warned about the same thing in 2010 but didn’t do anything. It is quite a scandal. Even the venerable Nikkei Shimbun scolded Mizuho. Shocking. Appalling. But links between Mizuho and the mob date back longer than that. In February 2006, an executive in the bank’s business inspection department was arrested and confessed to having sold data on more than 1,250 customers to a yakuza front company. It was his department that was supposed to investigate and weed out yakuza clients, not sell them information. Oops. To be fair, though, despite Mizuho’s sordid history with yakuza finance, it was Citibank that used to be known in the underworld as 893 Ginko (893 Bank), since 893 can be read in Japanese as “yakuza.” The term comes from a losing hand in Japanese cards; many yakuza groups were originally federations of gamblers. Gamblers like banks. In 2009, the FSA ordered Citibank Japan to suspend its retail banking operations for a month after they found its system for monitoring crime syndicates and other antisocial organizations was not being updated. In addition, Citibank Japan was revealed as having maintained several hundred accounts for people affiliated with “antisocial groups” including yakuza bosses. Yeah, that was when we really knew the mob was non grata in the financial sector. Sorry, I forget: 2009 was the second time Citibank had been sanctioned. For similar reasons, its private banking division was closed down in 2004. Among its clients then was Saburo Takeshita, a notorious financier for the Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan’s largest crime group. However, Citibank has cleaned up its act these days. Of course it helped that, in February 2012, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the Yamaguchi-gumi. The smarter gangsters all closed their remaining Citibank accounts immediately — some even before the announcement. (Go figure.) If the goal of the sanctions was to get yakuza money out of the U.S. economy or any U.S. connected financial entity, it seems to have had an impact. But back to the Mizuho Bank and that business improvement order — a measure whose timing was probably not random. In fact, it was likely the government’s way of celebrating Oct. 1, 2013 — the second anniversary of the Organized Crime Exclusionary Ordinances (OCEOs) going national in Japan. From then, it essentially became a crime to pay off the yakuza or share any profits with them. The results have been significant and the FSA would have timed things to remind people of that. A somewhat unexpected side effect of the OCEOs has been to largely drive individual yakuza — not just the mobs’ business — out of local banks, because almost every banking contract in Japan now has an “ordinary crime exclusionary clause” (OCEC). That simple but effective provision was the brainchild of an anti-yakuza crusader, the late Toshiro Igari. A former prosecutor, Igari came up with the idea after consultations with the Westin Hotel in Tokyo, which had had serious problems getting a senior gang boss named Tadamasa Goto to kindly vacate their premises after he had checked in. In fact the hotel found it had no legal grounds on which to kick him out — until Igari thought of a way to ensure such problems would henceforth be avoided. Now included in many contracts, the clause requires signatories to affirm they are not members of any “antisocial forces” — aka yakuza. If they are, but sign anyway, not only can the institution unilaterally invalidate the contract — but yakuza members can be (and now often are) arrested for fraud. Consequently, readily visible yakuza — those with tattoos and/or missing fingers — are now finding themselves unable to maintain a savings account or even rent an apartment. The magic cocktail of OCEOs, OCECs — and more stringent national anti-organized crime laws — have squeezed the yakuza harder than 1,000 arrests. In fact by 2013, the mobs’ membership, which had hovered around 80,000 for 16 years, was down to roughly 63,000 according to National Police Agency data. One group, the Kyushu Seido-kai, even disbanded this year, leaving only 21 designated organized crime groups out there. However, the Democratic Party of Japan, which was ousted from power in a landslide last December, had the open backing of two major crime groups, as I’ve written before. Indeed, its Minister of Justice, Keishu Tanaka, even had to resign because of his alleged ties to the Inagawa-kai crime group. But the bold actions of the FSA should let everyone know the game has changed. Doing business with the yakuza at any level will no longer be tolerated. There’s a new sheriff in town, and he’s as clean as they come; he’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of the now-ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Okay, there was that picture of him with Icchu Nagamoto, a Yamaguchi-gumi financier, published in the Shukan Post news weekly last year — but Mr. Clean said he didn’t really know him. And it was also reported that, after visiting the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant’s disaster zone on the 19th of last month, Abe had a covert meeting with the head of a major entertainment firm who is under investigation for organized crime ties. But hey, in order to root out the bad guys you have to know who they are. Right? So now it’s a new day in Japan. With Tokyo chosen to host the 2020 Olympics, the police are definitely feeling an impetus to remove the yakuza from public view. In addition, a movement to make casinos legal in Japan is also bad news for the yakuza, since illegal gambling is one traditional source of their income. However, the government will try to make sure the cops and politicians, not the yakuza, run the new legal racket. So the push is on. Yep. There’s a new sheriff, heat from the police, moves to cut the yakuza off from gambling money — and to kick them out of the financial sector as well. This time it looks to be curtains for the tattooed gangsters of old. But I don’t think I’d bet on it.",

    "source": "JAL rehab a lesson for possible Tepco failure? <eos> Since the start of the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant crisis, debate has raged over whether the government should have Tokyo Electric Power Co. go bankrupt. Even though the financial crises facing Tepco are far greater than those Japan Airlines Co. faced, one question that crops up is why the state won’t let Tepco fail like JAL did in 2010, after which the government stepped in and restructured the carrier. Observers say if Tepco goes bankrupt, the government would have to directly pay the trillions of yen it will cost to compensate disaster victims who had to evacuate their homes and abandon their livelihoods, to decontaminate the areas hit by radioactive fallout and to scrap the Fukushima plant. The government is reluctant to assume those costs, which would be akin to the state accepting the blame for the triple meltdown crisis, the observers say. “If Tepco goes bankrupt, there would be discussions over who should pay the compensation. It would have to be the government. It’s a matter of how to take responsibility, and the government wants that to fall to Tepco,” said Eiichiro Kume, a former JAL employee who unsuccessfully ran in the Lower House election in December 2012 from Your Party. Kume is now a secretary to Kenji Nakanishi, an Upper House lawmaker from the party, which wants Tepco broken up. Tepco is presently paying redress to the victims of the meltdowns, but it has to tap the state-backed Nuclear Damage Liability Facilitation Fund because the compensation is so vast. The fund has so far paid out more than ¥3 trillion in compensation, meaning the government is in reality footing the bill for the redress of victims, even though it appears like Tepco is directly in charge of making the payments. Another factor making it difficult for the government to liquidate Tepco is the cost to decontaminate the areas near the plant, said Shuya Nomura, a professor at the Chuo Law School. “In JAL’s case, it was possible to recover the taxpayer money if JAL made a successful comeback and profited,” said Nomura, who was on a Diet panel that investigated the Fukushima disaster. “In the case of Tepco, the government would be paying for things outside the utility’s main brief, including decontamination. It is unclear how much it would amount to and whether the money would ever be recouped,” he said. Nomura noted that JAL failed because of mismanagement but that Tepco was doing fine before monster tsunami from the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, overwhelmed the insufficiently protected power plant. Bankruptcy would force shareholders and creditors to eat the loss too, which they would find unfair considering a natural disaster was the main cause of Tepco’s problem, Nomura said. Others, however, argue that Tepco could have prevented or at least mitigated the crisis, but managers and now-disgraced government regulators with cozy ties to the power industry failed to ensure the plant was adequately protected despite long being aware of the tsunami threat. Financial market players have been pressuring the government to keep Tepco from failing, claiming that a bankruptcy may lead to a default of the utility’s corporate bonds and bring chaos to the credit market, he said. Kume and Nomura both feel the government should scrap Tepco because under the current situation, it is required to turn a profit as a private firm and cover the costs of compensation, decontamination and decommissioning. “No matter how much profit Tepco makes, it will all go to compensation,” Kume said. “Do you think employees can keep their motivation in such a company?” Indeed, hundreds of employees have left the utility every year since the disaster started, including 712 who quit in fiscal 2012 and 465 in fiscal 2011, compared with just 134 in fiscal 2010, which ended on March 31, 2011. Kume warned that if the situation continues as is, Tepco may not retain the ability to provide a stable power supply. Kume said one lesson learned from JAL that can be applied to Tepco is that undergoing bankruptcy could enable the utility to have a fresh start and improve employee morale. Kume, who worked for JAL for more than 20 years and left the airline right before it went bankrupt, said he has met his former colleagues since the bankruptcy and their morale was much higher than before. Nomura said that another lesson to be drawn from the experience with JAL is that the government should have a firm vision of the future of the company and the overall industry if Tepco were to go bust. “The government had to build a basic policy for Japan’s airline industry in the process of reconstructing JAL,” Nomura said. Some argued that JAL did not have to survive because All Nippon Airways could be expanded to compensate for its disappearance. But JAL staged a comeback because the government decided the nation’s airline industry needed the flagship carrier, Nomura said. “This lesson indicates that a basic energy policy needs to be established (before any Tepco bankruptcy), otherwise, it would be hard to come up with a vision of a new Tepco,” he said, noting any new Tepco must embody that new energy policy. The government is currently reviewing its long-term energy policy, specially focusing on what to do with nuclear power and renewable energy.",

    "source": "The method behind the brashness <eos> Osaka While his inflammatory comments have made headlines and his combative, argumentative style has shocked and enraged those who take comfort in the traditional politician’s art of discreet ambiguity, there is method behind Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto’s perceived rhetorical madness. Since coming to power in 2008 as the governor of Osaka, no Japanese politician has more effectively used TV and social media, especially Twitter, to his advantage. But whether the subject is municipal services, budget cuts or the policies of his Nippon Ishin no Kai (Japan Restoration Party), Hashimoto’s rhetoric often takes a recognizable path. First, he makes his point even if it isn’t related to the question (“Well, yes, bureaucratic reform in Osaka Prefecture is important. But, ultimately, this is about the need to eliminate bureaucratic waste by merging the city and prefecture of Osaka.”) Second, he identifies what he sees as the problem (“We’re in this mess because of lazy bureaucrats and greedy unions”). Third, he makes the case for change (“We have to compete with Tokyo and change the educational system so generations of Osakans develop the skills needed to compete internationally”). At that point, no matter the issue, Hashimoto will likely refer to the same basic set of pro-corporate solutions for bringing about change: budget and personnel cuts, union curbs and privatization plans, while of course demanding clear rules and a level playing field. Such talk warms the hearts of not only Osakans worried about their city falling behind Tokyo and East Asia economically, but also corporate supporters and some in foreign business community who, until his “comfort women” comments in May made him an international pariah, saw the 44-year-old populist as the best hope for leading Japan into a new era of prosperity. To get his message out, Hashimoto, a lawyer, uses news conferences to conduct trials in the court of public opinion so that he, the defense attorney (for the city), can do battle with the prosecution (the media, his enemies in the bureaucracy) using a direct debating style to win over the jury (the voters). Thankfully, his remarks are usually free of the vague euphemisms that more senior politicians use, and spiced with an occasional bon mot that ends up in the news. A logical argument in clear, direct Japanese is the only way to convince voters, he says. Hashimoto’s style also differs in that his rhetoric and media strategy are aimed at a new generation of Japanese who do not trust newspapers. The TV and Internet are his preferred media, and many of his appearances are online in unedited form. This allows him to repeat his points endlessly in front of the cameras and revise them, knowing it will all be publicly available, especially if —after followup questions — he believes TV producers will use an earlier sound bite that he does not like. Is this rhetorical style and media strategy working? Recent polls show Nippon Ishin has a popularity rating of about 1 percent. Yet the mayor himself still has a strong base, although many have doubts about his specific goals, like the city-prefecture merger. As long as Osakans continue to understand what he says, it seems, he will always have a political home, regardless of what happens to his political movement.",

    "source": "SDP woos Koizumi to lend clout to anti-nuclear drive <eos> If only briefly, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi raised hopes he will stage a comeback as an anti-nuclear crusader when he met Tuesday with the head of a minor but like-minded opposition party. But, during their 45-minute meeting, Koizumi declined Social Democratic Party chief Tadatomo Yoshida’s request to cooperate with his five-Diet-member party’s push to abolish nuclear plants. According to Yoshida, Koizumi argued that it was the duty of each party and politician to appeal separately and directly to the public. “I asked him to cooperate, but he said that each party, which has its own arguments, should try to realize the abolition of nuclear power plants,” Yoshida, who took charge of the SDP earlier this month, told reporters after the meeting. Koizumi also insisted he is not planning to form a new party or a political force centered on anti-nuclear policy, Yoshida, said, noting Koizumi told him he will continue to seek to change public opinion, which will eventually influence the government. Once the most powerful opposition party and a longtime foe of Koizumi’s Liberal Democratic Party, the SDP has advocated a nonnuclear energy policy for years. It is now a minor party, with five Diet members. Koizumi met Yoshida at the Center for International Public Policy Studies in Tokyo, where Koizumi serves as an adviser. After stepping down as prime minister in 2006, Koizumi, 74, largely withdrew from the public eye, rarely remarking on politics. That changed earlier this year when he began calling for the abolition of nuclear plants after visiting a final disposal site in Finland that is supposed to store spent fuel up to 100,000 years. The SDP is attempting to expand its political clout by calling on antinuclear political forces, such as Koizumi.

    "source": "Hotel's misleading menus leave bad taste <eos> OSAKA - Hankyu Hanshin Hotels Co., under fire for deceiving consumers by misrepresenting items on its menus, is drawing sympathy from some in the food and hotel industries. According to people involved in the food service industry, false advertising of this kind “happens quite often, and the company might have not intended to falsify the menus.” During a news conference Monday, Hankyu Hanshin Hotels President Hiroshi Desaki claimed that touting Vannamei shrimp as Shiba shrimp is a customary practice among people in the industry. Desaki also said the company did not feel it necessary to inform customers it was using a cheaper type of scallion than “kujo negi,” a traditional Japanese scallion mainly grown in Kujo, southern Kyoto. He said the scallions were served as “a side dish.” Desaki claimed that although lying about the nature of the items on the menus was far from a simple mistake, the company never intended to profit from the misrepresentations. He admitted, though, that it was a mistake “for which we have already received a severe rebuke.” According to sources in to the food industry, Shiba shrimp is available only in small quantities and at high prices. The sources said that a Chinese restaurant in the city of Chiba resolved the problem by offering “ebi” chili (stir-fried shrimp in chili sauce) as two different menu items. The price of the item named Shiba ebi chili sauce, apparently using Shiba shrimp, is 1½ times higher than for the item named ebi chili sauce. Desaki was criticized, however, by a man who has worked for Hankyu Hanshin Hotels restaurants and other eateries. “If a hotel with such a strong brand image labels an item as Shiba shrimp, everyone will be deceived,” he said. “All restaurants that I worked at had different policies, but the only difference was whether the owners advertised the items (with cheaper and more expensive ingredients) separately.” Amid the mounting criticism, a 53-year-old owner of a Chinese-style eatery in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, expressed understanding for the misrepresented fare. “When I entered this business, we used to call all small shrimp ‘Shiba shrimp,’ ” the owner said. “For people of my age, it can happen.” An owner of a restaurant in the Kinki region that serves dishes using kujo negi said: “We inform our customers” if ingredients have to be replaced due to a typhoon or in other similar situations. “In this business, (false labeling) is very common,” he said. “The point is whether the issue will come to light or not.” There are those who worry that the scandal, which involved eight restaurants run by Hankyu Hanshin Hotels, may spread to other companies. The hotel operator decided at a board meeting Tuesday to appoint Kazuhide Fujimoto, a managing executive officer of the Osaka-based company, to take over as president from Desaki, who will resign to take responsibility for the scandal. Fujimoto will succeed Desaki on Friday when Mitsuo Nozaki, a board member of parent company Hankyu Hanshin Holdings Inc., will become part-time chairman of the hotel chain. Fujimoto, a 63-year-old career hotelier, will be tasked with strengthening the company’s management and restoring customer trust.",

Wanna bottle of fresh air? <eos> httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLAxtYxUuLI Frisk is taking the phrase “like a breath of fresh air” quite seriously — or rather not seriously at all. The breath-mints brand’s latest online campaign involves a lottery to win a grand prize of seven bottles filled to their brim with exotic air (or, if you’re a cynic, seven completely empty bottles). The Frisk Select World Fresh Air Collection campaign is promoting the introduction of the brand’s newest flavor — Fresh Herb Mint — as well as the return of Frisk Spearmint. And, doing what must be one of the most enviable jobs, one Frisk employee is being sent to seven scenic destinations across the world, just to pump air into glass bottles. So far he’s been to Waipio Valley in Hawaii to collect air of a “mysterious atmosphere.” You can watch a rather exhilarating video of the process. Yes, who wouldn’t want this man’s job? He’s being jetted around the world to simply don a lab coat and white gloves, and then stick an air-compressor tube into a bottle for 15 seconds. His next destination will be Canada’s glacial Moraine Lake for some “romantic” air, which will be followed by South America’s Iguazu falls (healing air), England’s Oxford (intelligent air), Matterhorn of the Northern Alps (freezing air), Tanzania’s Kilimanjaro (wild air) and finally Tasmania (beautiful air). To prove that the air really has been obtained and make anyone with a desk job feel completely inferior, sad and jealous, a video of the air-collection at each destination will be uploaded onto the campaign site. The Frisk Select World Fresh Air Collection is being described as a gift for people suffering the daily stress of modern life. Quite how it will help, though, is unclear. Perhaps it’s just a case of positive thinking: The bottles are NOT empty, they are full! Five sets of bottles can be won, as well as 50 original Frisk gift boxes. To enter the lottery, you just fill out the form here . And do it before 11:59 p.m. on Oct. 31, when the opportunity to win will vanish . . . into thin air.",

    "source": "Will Olympic glory carry beyond Tokyo? <eos> If Tokyo’s reaction to winning the 2020 Olympics, especially among the cash-strapped TV stations and other media types who rely on bread and circuses-type events to pay the bills, made you feel like Alice in Wonderland or a character in a Samuel Beckett play, you’re not alone. Well beyond the drawbridge of Old Edo, where the other roughly 90 percent of the country lives, the general feeling was a mixture of “Good for you” and “Don’t forget the victims of Tohoku and that problem in Fukushima. You know, the one you told the world was under control?” The triumph also came with contradictory feelings about the alleged benefits for the rest of the country. There is hope that the boastful predictions — all from Tokyo-based pundits, of course — about the Olympics being of great benefit to local economies will turn out to be something other than wishful thinking or cynical propaganda. However, there is also fear that the end result will be an even further shift of wealth and power to the capital, while the rest of the nation is left to grow older and poorer, withering in decaying towns and villages whose infrastructures age as rapidly as their remaining residents. A Hokkaido Shimbun editorial summed up the concerns of many local governments around the country, arguing that pouring national funds into Olympic-related construction that further promotes concentration in Tokyo at the expense of local finances is not acceptable. Or, as a Kyoto Shimbun editorial asked, why was Tokyo really chosen? For the reconstruction of Japan or for the revitalization of Tokyo? The editors added that the Tokyo that boasted of its compactness, vibrant youth culture, food and environmental safety, and ability to raise ¥400 billion in donations for the Summer Olympics, appears to be located in a different world from the one most Japanese inhabit. To be sure, parts of Japan may benefit from Olympic-related tourism. Kyoto, even as its newspaper editors protest, is no doubt calculating how many foreign tourists will visit the ancient capital between now and 2020. Sapporo, which has indicated an interest in hosting a future Summer Olympics (it already hosted the 1972 Winter Games), hopes visitors, after sweltering in Tokyo’s summer heat during the games, will cool off by traveling to Hokkaido. In Osaka, despite the city’s losing bid for the 2008 Games, Mayor Toru Hashimoto is dangling the prospect of an Osaka Olympics to push his agenda of unifying the city and prefecture. And you can be sure that local government officials and Diet members from all 47 prefectures are wondering how they can get a piece of the Olympic action. History, of course, is not going to repeat itself. In 1964, when Tokyo last hosted the Summer Games, Japan was a smaller, younger country of just less than 100 million people, a mere 6.3 percent of whom were 65 years or older. In 2020, nearly 30 percent of a population of about 124 million will be senior citizens. A decade later, in 2030, 20 percent of the population in 43 prefectures will be 75 years or older. The four exceptions include Tokyo. Thus, it is not spite or envy outside Tokyo that is driving Olympic criticism, but cold hard facts about unavoidable local demographic changes ahead, and the political, economic and social changes they will bring. Local leaders cannot afford, literally or figuratively, to sit back and let the Mad Hatters in Tokyo hold their nostalgic tea parties because they know that, at some point and in some form, they, too, will be asked to chip in to help cover the bill.",

    "source": "Oh, to be blissfully unfree in Nippon's isles . . . <eos> “Freedom.” “Liberty.” Ringing words. Better than any other, they define modern times. They sparked three early-modern revolutions — England’s “Glorious Revolution” (1688), the American Revolution of 1776-83, and the French Revolution beginning around 1789. Japan then was a “closed country” — had been since 1638, would be until 1854, its citizens barred from leaving and almost all foreigners barred from entering, both on pain of death. While freedom was being born in the West, or being seized from recalcitrant rulers, a very different ideal was maturing in Japan — the ideal of submission. Absolute, total, unquestioning submission. Article 97 of Japan’s postwar Constitution declares, “The fundamental human rights by this Constitution guaranteed to the people of Japan are fruits of the age-old struggle of man to be free.” That and similar passages betray the document’s foreign origins. The “struggle of man to be free” does not shine in the Japanese tradition. What does is a diametrically contrary struggle — the struggle of man to be unfree. It boggles the modern mind, Japanese scarcely less than foreign. Prodigies of obedience, servility, self-surrender — heroic or abject, call them what you will! — characterize Japanese history and literature. They are held up as models of the highest conduct, epitomes of the loftiest aspirations. In his English-language classic “Bushido” (1900), the Christian scholar Inazo Nitobe tells with unconcealed admiration of a samurai lord who, falling into disfavor, fled into rustic exile. His son, still a child, became the object of pursuit by those bent on wiping out the entire clan. A retainer had a son of the same age who bore a striking resemblance to the hunted child. Duty spoke clear — the lower-ranking child must be sacrificed, his head presented to the authorities as proof of mission accomplished. Neither mother nor child hesitated for an instant. The retainer’s child was killed; the authorities were fooled; the young lord lived on; honor was served. The novelist Kikuchi Kan (1888-1948), in a short story titled “On the Conduct of Lord Tadanao” (1918), relates in fictional form the historical dispossession and banishment, in 1623, of the lord of Echizen (present-day Fukui). Lord Tadanao was (as we would say today) emotionally disturbed. His mad outrages grew scandalous. The authorities at last felt compelled to intervene. Kan describes the aftermath of a drinking party: “Lord Tadanao was in an unusually cheerful mood. His favorite page boy, Masuda Kannosuke, ventured to make a remark while replenishing his lord’s great wine cup. ” ‘Why have we not seen your lordship lately in the military drill hall?’ he asked.” Taking offense for some reason, “Lord Tadanao went white with rage. Seizing a tray for wine cups … he hurled it with the speed of an arrow toward Kannosuke’s face. The violence was unexpected, and Kannosuke blanched; but, rigidly trained as he was in the code of loyalty, he made no attempt to dodge. He took the impact of the tray full on the front of his face and fell prostrate where he was …” There was only one thing for Kannosuke to do and, that night, he did it: He disemboweled himself. The submission ethos reaches an apex (or nadir) with junshi , the custom of committing suicide upon the death of one’s lord. Of what value is life to a loyal retainer bereft of his lord? Though formally outlawed in 1663, the practice flourished almost into modern times, its last famous exemplar being Gen. Maresuke Nogi, hero of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05. When Emperor Meiji died in 1912, the general and his wife committed suicide in their Tokyo home. “The relationship between lord and vassal should be like that of lovers,” says the 18th-century “Hagakure,” a compendium of samurai ideals. “Whether (the vassal) is or is not loved by the lord, or may even be unknown to him, this makes not the slightest difference; he is continually grateful for his lord’s benevolence to the very marrow of his bones and weeps tears of gratitude as he devotedly renders him service.” Imagine Nitobe’s samurai, or Kannosuke — or Nogi, for that matter — reading the present-day Constitution. Would they not be puzzled? “We, the Japanese people … do proclaim that sovereign power resides with the people …” They would hardly recognize this as Japanese thinking. They would be right. It was crafted under the auspices of the postwar U.S.-led Allied Occupation and reflects Western, not traditional Japanese, ideals — a fact that has rankled the ruling Liberal Democratic Party since its founding in 1955. Last year a resurgent LDP issued a draft plan for revision of the Constitution. Conspicuous among its proposals is the deletion of almost all references to the universality of freedom, equality and human rights. Instead, the draft explains, “Rights are gradually formulated through the history, tradition and culture of each community. Therefore we believe that the provisions concerning human rights should reflect the history, culture and tradition of Japan.” To lovers of freedom, that is very ominous language. The “history, culture and tradition of Japan” boast peaks that enrich and inspire the world — in literature, painting, theater, sculpture, architecture, landscape gardening, anything you like, but not in freedom, at least not as we understand the word today. Understood differently, perhaps Japan can make a case for itself. The modern Zen master Daisetz T. Suzuki, in “Zen and Japanese Culture” (1959), says, “We talk very much these days about all kinds of freedom, political, economic and otherwise, but these freedoms are not at all real … The real freedom is the outcome of enlightenment.” The LDP draft Constitution does not call for a return to the ethics of the “Hagakure.” But it does unapologetically subordinate “freedoms and rights” to “duties and obligations.” That accords with Japanese tradition — not, however, with what to a modern mind seems best in it.",

The job cuts will be made through a voluntary retirement program that will be offered to eligible employees in the domestic tobacco business and corporate functions, JT said in a statement Wednesday. “Our Japanese domestic tobacco business operates in an increasingly challenging environment, mainly due to consecutive tobacco tax increases, tightening of smoking-related regulations, growing health consciousness and an aging society,” the company in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Asia’s largest listed tobacco maker, JT faces declining demand in the home market amid the shrinking population and has been expanding overseas to offset this weakness. The ratio of smokers in Japan has fallen 4 percentage points to 20.9 percent over the last four years, according to the company’s website. Overseas revenue accounts for about half of JT’s sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The most recent voluntary retirement program was in the year that ended in March 2005 and 5,796 employees accepted that plan, spokesman Hisashi Sekiguchi said before the announcement. The company cut jobs at that time to increase competitiveness, he said. JT shares climbed 3.65 percent to ¥3,550 after NHK reported the company plans to shed 20 percent of its workforce and close some factories. In April, JT forecast net income will climb 21 percent to ¥415 billion while sales will gain 12 percent to ¥2.37 trillion in the year ending on March 31. A weaker yen is boosting the value of revenue from tobacco operations overseas. The government, which had owned 50 percent of the company, cut its stake to 33 percent in March to help pay for reconstruction in the Tohoku region.",

    "source": "Anti-nuclear Koizumi agitating for comeback? <eos> Long silent and out of the public eye, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi’s recent rumblings against nuclear power are causing many to wonder if the most popular leader of recent decades is laying the groundwork for a political comeback. The 74-year-old Koizumi has met separately with two opposition party heads — Tadatomo Yoshida of the Social Democratic Party and Yoshimi Watanabe of Your Party — to discuss his mission to rid the nation of all 50 of its nuclear reactors. A visit to a spent-fuel disposal site in Finland following the 2011 Fukushima crisis converted him to an anti-nuclear activist, Koizumi claims. Recent speeches given at closed-door meetings made the headlines of gossip magazines. Now Koizumi is stepping up his anti-nuclear campaign. On Oct. 16, for the first time he allowed TV cameras from media outlets to shoot an anti-nuclear lecture in its entirety in Kisarazu, Chiba Prefecture. Next up, Koizumi is scheduled to hold a news conference at the Japan National Press Club on Nov. 12, where he will face senior reporters from all the major news outlets for the first time since stepping down as prime minister in 2006. “He has great power to send messages to the public. That’s what I felt today,” Yoshida of the SDP said after meeting Koizumi on Tuesday. While serving as prime minister, Koizumi was often touted as a powerful communicator, a telegenic genius of the sound bite. Critics called him a political agitator who labeled his foes “anti-reformers.” But his popularity with voters carried the Liberal Democratic Party to a landslide victory in the 2005 Lower House election, in part due to his quest to privatize the postal system. In office, Koizumi rose above his party, a “lone wolf” who relied on communication skills to achieve his popularity. It is this approach, rather than by forming an alliance with a political force, that he appears to be adopting again to get his message across to the public. During Tuesday’s meeting, Koizumi declined Yoshida’s offer to team up on the abolition of nuclear plants. Instead, Koizumi stressed that each party and politician should make their own appeals to the public, and denied any intention to form a new political party, as gossip magazines have speculated, according to Yoshida. It’s possible that Koizumi sized up the SDP and other anti-nuclear suitors and decided an alliance would not benefit him. The SDP and Seikatsu no To (People’s Life Party) — the only parties to advocate for the immediate abolition of all nuclear plants — performed poorly in the latest Lower House election, in July, and their public support rates have remained below 1 percent all year, according to NHK polls. Another hurdle to an alliance: The two share few views with Koizumi other than the anti-nuclear stance. The SDP and Seikatsu no To support big government with increased spending on social security, while Koizumi was a champion of small government and free markets. An advocate of pacifist policies, the SDP calls for cutting back U.S. military bases in Japan, while Koizumi was an earnest supporter of the Japan-U.S. security alliance. “Nobody believes the SDP and Mr. Koizumi agree on (various policy issues.) They never agree on security issues, either,” LDP Secretary-General Shigeru Ishiba said Tuesday. Still, officials at the prime minister’s office appear worried about Koizumi’s potential to sway the public. Many LDP lawmakers have pushed long and hard for nuclear power plants to be built in their constituencies. And Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to restart any of the 50 reactors that pass Nuclear Regulation Authority safety tests. At the end of last month, Abe’s Cabinet appointed Shinjiro Koizumi, a son of the former prime minister, as parliamentary secretary at the Reconstruction Agency. This appointment was widely seen as an attempt to keep the young Koizumi, who is also popular with voters, under control, to prevent him from emerging, like his father, as a rising star of the anti-nuclear movement. As a senior official at the Reconstruction Agency, the son is now obliged to toe the government line, including its energy policies. On Wednesday, facing an opposition lawmaker during a Diet session for the first time, he was asked to explain his nuclear stance. He simply responded that he would concentrate on urgent issues related to the wrecked Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant, such as the problems of radioactive water and compensating local residents. “I’m a parliamentary secretary and a member of the government,” he reportedly told the Diet session.",

    "source": "China cracks down on 'American Idol'-style shows <eos> BEIJING - Chinese authorities are cracking down on how often broadcasters can air reality, dating and talent shows such as the Chinese versions of “American Idol” and “The Voice,” which draw huge audiences. Provincial broadcasters show such programs, which are cheap to produce and earn a lot of advertising revenue, on satellite channels seen around the country. The official Xinhua News Agency reported that the “American Idol” kind of talent shows now need approval from the body that oversees broadcasting, which will license one such program per channel each quarter for prime-time viewing. It also reported that new regulations require satellite channels to allocate no less than 30 percent of their weekly airtime to topics including news, economics, culture and science from next year. There have been repeated efforts to limit U.S.-style reality TV and other light fare shown on satellite TV, or push them out of prime-time viewing, with stated reasons including the need to stop vulgar content and promote more efficient use of resources. The State General Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television reportedly issued the latest regulations. Liu Shanying, a political scientist at Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said he suspected the new regulations were due to satellite channels taking too much audience away from national broadcaster China Central Television. The Communist Party administration “is helping CCTV, the TV broadcaster that has the main task of carrying forward the government’s message,” said Liu, who used to work for CCTV. “The local stations have more freedom to attract audiences with entertainment shows. And that takes away too many viewers from CCTV and they are afraid that no one will pay attention to the government’s tune.” The restrictions are expected to drive still more viewers online — where they can watch the same types of prerecorded shows — and away from state TV.",

    "source": "Hotelier lays food scam to staff ignorant of law <eos> Hankyu Hanshin Hotels Co. has been misrepresenting items on its menus for seven years at eateries in at least four prefectures, possibly scamming some 79,000 patrons in the process, and management is blaming the misdeeds on employees ignorant about the law. The hotelier said Friday it is being inundated with calls from irate customers seeking reimbursement for their meals. The wrongdoing, which according to media reports included claiming on menus that frozen fish was fresh, prepared chocolate was hand-made, and boasting a prestigious red caviar that turns out was flying fish eggs, started in March 2006 and ended last month. As of Thursday morning, the firm had reimbursed 3,480 customers to the tune of ¥12.2 million. The company estimates the final amount of compensation may reach ¥110 million. According to media reports, no patron has fallen ill from eating any of the food items. Hiroshi Desaki, president of the hotelier, told reporters Thursday the firm never intended to fabricate its menus, laying the litany of mislabelled fare on workers who lacked legal knowledge. Although employees in most cases thought misrepresenting food was highly unethical, they failed to realize they were acting illegality, a spokesman for the hotelier claimed Friday, fiercely denying the firm ever set out to hoodwink its customers. “Our employees, be they chefs or salespeople, just didn’t understand the standard laws concerning food labeling. So even in finding menus that lied about the fare, they just didn’t know they weren’t allowed to serve the (misrepresented food),” the spokesman said, lamenting the fact that because no worker ever dared to openly question the scam and explore its possible illegality, hordes of astonished reporters are now sneering at what they see as the firm’s absolute lack of moral fiber. During the press conference Thursday, Desaki apologized for betraying the public’s trust. “We never intended to rake in profits by (misrepresenting food),” he said, expressing the firm’s determination to get to the bottom of the misdeeds. Six menu items will be subject to scrutiny, including pork dishes in which the origins of the meat were falsified. The firm admitted it was wrongfully calling a ready-made chocolate sauce its own. “It appears our employees were touting the sauce as handmade because they thought that would make the (item) sound more attractive,” board director Masanobu Morimoto explained at one point during Thursday’s press conference. When asked if that amounted to deliberate fabrication, he repeated it happened due to “employees’ lack of knowledge.” Such false labelling has so far been detected at 23 restaurants and other venues operated by the firm, including eight hotels in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka and Hyogo prefectures. A total of 10 executives, including Desaki, will face pay cuts as punishment, with the president’s salary subject to a 20 percent cut for the time being. Kazuo Sumi, president of Hankyu Hanshin Holdings Inc., will voluntarily return 50 percent of his salary.",

    "source": "Marketing that enters your brain through your nose <eos> On Meiji Dori, between Harajuku and Shibuya, I recently came across a tall futuristic titanium-silver contraption staring down at the street with what looked like six portholes. When I got closer, I found it had a window display of small bottles with three signs below saying “touch here!” Being the tragically curious Alice in Wonderland type, I did. As soon as my hand passed over a sensor, a cool fragrant mist drifted out from a blower above and descended over my head. Naturally, I touched the other two panels . . . And then the first one again . . . and then the other ones again . . . then the first one yet again — and I was just considering doing it all again, despite how daft I looked with my nose in the air, when it happened . . . I discovered how scent-marketing works: I saw the store behind the silver machine and walked straight in. This is how @aroma , an aromatherapy and scent-marketing company, is enticing customers into its first Tokyo store. And once you’ve been lured you in, there’s a whole range of essential oils for you to explore — this time invoked by 15 buttons. Japan has no shortage of retailers selling essential oils, but @aroma has a few things that puts it notch above. First is its gadgetry — the outdoors Aroma Shower mega diffuser is a novelty and staff will also let you test the store’s range of sleek personal diffusers (battery and USB powered). But most impressive is its Aroma Oil Blender. Hooked up to 15 different bottles of essential oils, you can push a few buttons of your choice to create your own blend and it will be dispersed in a mist above your head. If you like your custom scent, the staff will make it on the spot for you to purchase (allow for a 30-minute wait, though). @aroma products are marketed with a design-conscious consumer in mind; no flower-child or pot-pourri aesthetics going on here. The packaging is simple and brightly color-coded, while the naming of the essential-oil ranges is no nonsense — Design Air, Clean Air, Botanical Air or Eco Air. And, as a Japanese company, it also focuses on native fragrances with three of its lineups. Botanical Air Japan includes a woody Mount Koya scent, a Kyoto cedar one and a Japanese citrus yuzu one. Sense of Japan uses fragrances associated with the country — including hinoki wood, perilla and sandalwood — and is named with words associated with Japanese tradition, such as Sei (purity) Miyabi (Kyoto aesthetics) and Iki (Edo aesthetics). The Message Aroma range uses Japanese phrases as names, including the virtually untranslatable Otsukaresama (the thing you say when you finish work — a concoction of hinoki , pine, marjoram, sandalwood, clary sage, and kopa iba) and Gambate (try hard! — spearmint, rosemary, niaouli, tea tree and lime). But what about the aromas that lured me in the first place? It started with a floral Stylish Glamour, followed by an original blend called Scent of Tokyo. And when the real smell of Tokyo returned, the minty Eco Air -2 Cool Feel was enough to make me want to follow my nose into the store. A whiff of scent marketing in Japan Japan, it appears, is at the forefront of scent marketing . At least, plenty of scent marketers like to quote Japanese companies on the subject. Skyword Scent Strategy states research carried out by fragrance producer Takasago . When computer users worked with different fragrances, it found the following: 20% fewer typing errors with lavender-scented air 33% fewer errors with jasmine-scented air 54% fewer errors with lemon-scented air Micro Fragrance is rolling out Japan’s largest-ever scenting program and using thousands of Prolitec diffusion systems to pump a Pomegranate Fusion fragrance into possibly the smelliest places in country — every single Maruhan pachinko parlor. Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology announced in April that it’s working on a Smelling Screen display system, which will release different odors depending on what is being shown on the screen. Japan’s household goods market is seeing a boost in scented goods, particularly fabric-softeners, which some people are preferring to the smell of perfume. Lenor is even suggesting you mix laundry scent boosters to create your own personal aroma.",

    "source": "India's 'miracle rooster' further complicates chicken-and-egg dilemma <eos> NEW DELHI - The question has long been, “Which came first, the chicken or the egg?” The apparently insoluble puzzle has become further complicated in India, where a rooster in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh has been laying eggs. According to a report in the The Asian Age newspaper, people are thronging the house of the rooster’s master and some are even offering money, considering it to be a God-sent creature. Local veterinarians have suggested the “miracle cock” should be handed to a veterinary research institute where the doctors would try to find out how a male bird can lay eggs, but it is as yet unclear if that will happen. The report said Ramhet Rawat, a resident of Dharkuiyyan in the state’s Barabanki district, bought the miracle rooster two weeks ago with the intention of cooking it. For a night, he kept it under a basket with the intention of slaughtering and cooking it the next day. But when he lifted the basket in the morning, to his utter surprise, he found the rooster had laid an egg. The bewildered Rawat called his neighbors and they investigated if it was actually a rooster or a hen. Everyone, the newspaper reported, agreed the bird is indeed male, and Rawat decided not to slaughter it immediately. Three days later, the cock again laid an egg. Since then, it has been laying an egg every third day. News of the miracle spread like wildfire, and curious onlookers are still converging at Rawat’s house to get a glimpse of the country’s “miracle cock.”",

    "source": "Tokyo homeless, Olympics cancelled, medals given for kindness, Mandela's birthday feted <eos> 100 YEARS AGO Wednesday, July 23, 1913 Tales of woe abound among Tokyo jobless Summer is generally a good season for employment-seekers of the laboring classes. This summer, however, there are twice as many unemployed men as usual. The Free Lodging House of Honjo, Tokyo, for instance, generally takes in about 20 lodgers nightly during the hot months, but this season some 45 are finding shelter there every night. Mr. Ito, director of the establishment, tells some interesting facts about its residents. “In summer, the gas and electric companies require a larger force of hands,” he says, “and these places are generally sought by fewer men than in any other season. Things are quite different this summer. “Men in the prime of life come here every day starving and fagged out. The majority are from the country. They come to the city with high ambition, and write home exaggerated accounts of their success. A few years later, they go back to their homes, with borrowed money, rigged up in royal style to impress their folks and friends. When they return to the city, their debts leave them in more trouble than before. These young men generally begin as hard workers or ambitious students, then as cheap laborers or coolies, and finally loafers, sheltered in the Poor House.” Among the more interesting free lodgers there is a young man who had a highly commendable record at the Osaka Hygienic Laboratory and was once recommended to go abroad to finish his studies. Deprived of his work, he wandered around in vain in quest of employment and finally, as a day laborer, came to the brink of starvation in the Free Lodging House. 75 YEARS AGO Saturday, June 16, 1938 ‘Wartime’ precludes 1940 Tokyo Olympics The Cabinet decided this morning to urge the Olympic Organizing Committee to return the 1940 Tokyo Games to the International Olympic Committee. The Welfare Ministry decided there should be no Tokyo Olympic Games in 1940 due to the present wartime circumstances. That decision was formally submitted to the Cabinet meeting today. While the Olympic Games have been awarded to the city of Tokyo and not to Japan as a nation, the O.O.C. is expected to comply with the request. Not only financial difficulties but also the psychological effects that the Games would have on the people — of whom a higher grade of concentration is now required on the fighting in China — were given by Welfare Minister Koichi Kido as reasons for his Ministry’s decision. “If Tokyo cancels the Olympics, it will cause considerable repercussions abroad,” he admitted. “But I think it is advisable to decide our national attitude over the Games now. At this time when the nation is required to endure material hardships, we may incur disdain from abroad if we are excited over the Olympics. Some people may argue that returning the Games may discourage physical culture, but I believe such an eventuality is forestalled by holding Meiji Festival sports meets on a larger scale or by sponsoring other national sporting events.” Matsuzo Nagai, Secretary-General of the O.O.C. reported the Welfare Ministry’s decision to Mayor Itta Kobashi of Tokyo Friday afternoon. Still reluctant to abandon the Games, the mayor the same day visited several Cabinet members. “I have done all I could for retaining the Olympics and am awaiting the Cabinet’s decision,” he said. “Even if the Games are cancelled, I wish to complete Komazawa Stadium for the sake of the health of Tokyo citizens after peace is restored in China.” Those who will be deprived of work as a result of returning the Games include three German Olympic technical advisers, who have been in Tokyo nearly one year on a three-year contract. 50 YEARS AGO Friday, July 5, 1963 100 given medals for their kind deeds On Wednesday, 100 persons were awarded the first Kind Behavior Badges by the Be Kind to Others Campaign headquarters in recognition of their acts of kindness. Seven of the 100, who were chosen from among the 210 recommended to the headquarters, attended the awarding ceremony held in Tokyo. Two of the seven were small primary school pupils. One of them, an 8-year-old girl, won the award for picking up a baby’s hat near her home and promptly handing it to the baby’s mother. Among other kind deeds recognized were guiding 14 blind masseuses to safety every day and lending a bus fare to a stranger who lost his wallet. The campaign was launched by Seiji Kaya, president of the University of Tokyo, early this year to make society better. 25 YEARS AGO Wednesday, July 13, 1988 ANC Tokyo group to fete Mandela’s 70th The Tokyo branch of the African National Congress (ANC), South Africa’s anti-apartheid organization, will hold a rally Saturday to celebrate the 70th birthday of their leader, Nelson Mandela, and to demand an end to his imprisonment, which has lasted 25 years. Jerry Matsila, representing the ANC Tokyo Office, said at a news conference Tuesday that the rally will be held at the Yamanote Church in Shibuya, Tokyo, from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Ambassadors from black African nations have been invited to speak at the gathering and a film depicting the situation in South Africa will be shown, he said. “Mandela means our hope. The name Mandela means freedom for us because of his contribution to the struggle against apartheid,” Matsila said. There have been similar gatherings and concerts in all parts of the world, including London, East Berlin, New York and Amsterdam, to fete Mandela’s birthday and demand his release.",

    "source": "What if Columbus had reached his goal: Japan? <eos> Every school child knows that in 1492 Christopher Columbus discovered America. Every school child knows wrongly. When the Genovese explorer’s three ships sailed westward from Palo de la Frontera, Spain, on Aug. 2, 1492, he was bound, he thought, for “the noble island of Cipangu” — Japan. Cipangu would be his gateway to “the Indies,” then the term for Asia — land of gold, spices, silks, perfumes, jewels. Columbus made four trans-Atlantic voyages, and died in 1506 certain he’d been on the fringes of Asia. That elusive land, with its riches, exotic civilizations and cities teeming with souls ripe for conversion to Christianity, would be just over the horizon, just a little farther ahead. America? He never heard of it, never imagined it. The truth would have shattered him — a vast continent and a boundless unknown ocean, the Pacific, lying between Europe and its golden dreams! What was “noble” about Japan? Wealth — fabulous wealth; or tales of it. No European in Columbus’ time had ever set foot there. Few knew it existed. Asia itself was scarcely known. Its luxuries were purveyed in Europe by Venetian traders who dealt with Arab middlemen in the lands of the eastern Mediterranean. That’s as far east as they got. Europe’s prime source on Asia was Marco Polo’s “Travels,” published around 1300. Polo (1254-1324) was a Venetian trader, one of a handful of European missionaries and merchants who, in the 13th and 14th centuries, took advantage of a brief opening of overland trade routes before they closed when the immense Mongol empire in Asia crumbled. Polo gained the trust of Kublai Khan (1215-94), the Mongol ruler in China, and remained 24 years as his adviser and emissary. He had never been to Cipangu (the name derives from “Jipen,” the Chinese reading of “Nihon”), but he had heard a great deal about it from Muslim traders in China — who hadn’t been there either. In the absence of facts, rumor is king. “Cipangu,” Polo wrote, was “most fertile in gold, pearls and precious stones, and they cover the temples and royal residences with solid gold. People (there) have tremendous quantities of gold. The King’s palace is roofed with pure gold, and his floors are paved in gold two fingers thick.” That’s where Columbus was bound in 1492, with results every school child knows. How did Japan — Spartan, resource-poor Japan — acquire such a gilded reputation? Ancient Japan did experience a modest gold rush. Gold discovered in 749 at Oshu — present-day Hiraizumi, Iwate Prefecture — was used to adorn the Nara Great Buddha, completed in 752. It was an impressive piece of statuary — 15.8 meters high and glittering with 440 kg of gold. Word got around, as it did concerning the 12th-century Chuson-ji Temple in Oshu, with its Golden Hall. There was also Kyoto’s Kinkaku-ji, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, built by Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu in 1397 — too late for Polo’s book, so Columbus knew nothing of it. Three stories high and entirely covered in gold leaf, it dazzles tourists to this day. That is about the extent of gold-encrusted Japan. Oshu gold was never much by world standards, and petered out in the 16th century. Columbus, we know, got no closer to Cipangu than Cuba, the Caribbean Islands and the northeast coast of South America. But supposing he had made it to Japan? Japan in 1492 was temporarily at peace, following the brutal and chaotic Onin War (1466-77); by 1500 it was descending into a century of the chaotic Sengoku Jidai civil war. Historians despair of making sense of it all; land-hungry warrior-baron fought land-hungry warrior-baron. From this distance it looks like carnage pure and simple. Shogun as the Onin War began was Ashikaga Yoshimasa (1436-90) — “the worst shogun ever to rule Japan,” writes Donald Keene, his latest biographer, in “Yoshimasa and the Silver Pavilion” (2003). A despairing letter Yoshimasa wrote to his son conveys pathetic helplessness: “The daimyo (feudal barons) do as they please and do not follow orders. That means there can be no government.” There was none. In 1473, as the war raged, Yoshimasa abdicated and turned to what he loved and knew best: art. Japan’s most characteristic art forms — tea-ceremony, noh drama, 31-syllable poetry, linked verse, flower-arranging, moon-viewing, monochrome painting, calligraphy, landscape gardening — all bear Yoshimasa’s stamp. “No man in the history of Japan,” writes Keene, “had a greater influence on the formation of Japanese taste. The worst of the shoguns was … the only one to leave a lasting heritage for the entire Japanese people.” The Higashiyama culture he spawned draws its name from the Higashiyama Hills of Kyoto, where in retirement he built a palace he named Ginkaku-ji (Temple of the Silver Pavilion). Starkly, almost startlingly austere, its name is misleading — not a description (there is no silver) but a mocking rejection of the golden opulence his grandfather Yoshimitsu embodied in the Kinkaku-ji. Raised in luxury himself, accused by contemporary chroniclers of callous indifference to the suffering of the poor, Yoshimasa went on to fashion at Ginkaku-ji an artistic legacy that sought beauty in simplicity, fulfillment in poverty, happiness in sadness. The Japanese word that expresses these qualities is wabi — the spiritual peace of material renunciation. What would Columbus have made of this — or Yoshimasa of Columbus, and of Europe’s rapacious avarice, insatiable curiosity and globe-girdling restlessness? Yoshimasa died in 1490, two years before Columbus’ first voyage to what he thought was Japan, land of gold. Would Columbus have appreciated the “silver” of wabi?",

    "source": "Cinderella stories inspire women to find their prince on social networking sites <eos> According to a recent study by Trend Soken , the phenomenon of the “Social Cinderella” is one of the driving forces behind changing attitudes towards internet dating among young women. “Social Cinderellas” are women who snag “high spec guys” (i.e. well-educated, good-looking men with high salaries) via social networking sites. As stories about these fairy-tale romances spread, more and more women have begun to warm to the idea of internet dating. Out of the 500 single women in their 20s and 30s interviewed for the study, 81% said that they felt had few chances for romantic meetings in their daily lives and 58% believed that social media was an effective tool for finding their dream man. Columnist Ai Azawa states in the report that modern Japanese women are throwing themselves into their work and are also really into self-improvement, as a result, they’ve got higher standards and are not particularly interested in settling for the men in their immediate social circle. Azawa says that she often hears Social Cinderella stories. But how common are they in practice? Out of the 61.4% of respondents who claimed to regularly use social media, 16% said that they’d encountered a dreamy guy in this way and 9.4% said they’d even managed to strike up a friendship with the guy in question. The study uses the term social-networking services to loosely refer to a whole slew of sites, from professional matchmaking websites to social networking sites like Facebook and Mixi, so it’s important to bear in mind that women are not necessarily signing up for dating services. One 26-year-old women questioned for the study mentions attending “meetings of social networking communities.” This could mean joining a group of people who meet over shared interests. Not necessarily aimed at encouraging people to hook up, social clubs tied to a hobby may be one of the ways that women are using the web to widen their social network as they fish around for potential partners. There are also matchmaking sites linked into Facebook. — sites like Omiai , which currently has 270,000 registered members. Omiai caters to the Cinderella element by boasting that 2,313 of the members are guys who have annual earnings of over ¥10 million. As many are cautious about the perils of online dating, the company highlights its safety policy which allows users to remain anonymous while chatting with a potential partner. Safety and privacy is a huge concern for Japanese women, so other social networking dating clubs take the risk out of going to meet with a stranger by bulking up the numbers. Pairs of friends who sign up for the rather unfortunately named Nikukai (meat club) service can go on double dates together at yakiniku (Korean barbeque restaurants). Nomitomi (drinking buddies) is a service that holds group mixers for singles, meaning singles don’t have to risk it alone with an unknown person.",

    "source": "Body fat sheds calories when chilled <eos> WASHINGTON - Transforming fat cells into calorie-burning machines may sound like a fantasy — the ultimate form of weight control — but the idea is not as far-fetched as it sounds. Unexpectedly, some fat cells directly sense dropping temperatures and release their energy as heat, according to a new study, and that ability might be harnessed to treat obesity and diabetes, researchers suggest. Fat is known to help protect animals from the cold, and not only by acting as insulation. In the early 1990s, scientists studying mice discovered that cold temperatures trigger certain fat cells, called brown adipose tissue, to release stored energy in the form of heat — in other words, to burn calories. Researchers have always assumed this mechanism was an indirect response to the physiological stress of cold temperatures, explains cell biologist Bruce Spiegelman of Harvard Medical School. The activation of brown fat seems to start with sensory neurons throughout the body informing the brain of a drop in temperature. In response, the brain sends out norepinephrine, the chief chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system, which mobilizes the body to cope with many situations. In experiments with animals, stimulating norepinephrine receptors triggered brown adipose tissue to release its energy and generate heat, while animals bred to be missing these receptors were unable to mount the same fat-cell response. People also have brown adipose tissue that generates heat when the body is cold. And unlike white fat, which builds up around the abdomen and contributes to many disorders including heart disease and diabetes, this brown fat is found in higher proportions in leaner people and seems to actively protect against diabetes. With brown fat, the heat-generating process depends on a protein called UCP1; the protein is also thought to be central in preventing diabetes. Researchers are exploring ways of activating this molecular pathway. But in trying to figure out exactly how fat cells respond to the body’s being cold, Spiegelman and colleagues made some discoveries about white fat cells. In a study published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers exposed various kinds of fat cells to cold temperatures directly. “We were a little surprised that no one had tried this before,” Spiegelman says. The researchers cooled several types of lab-grown human fat cells — brown, white and beige (white adipose tissue with some brown cells mixed in) — to temperatures between 27 and 39 degrees for four hours, eight hours or up to 10 days. White and beige cells responded in dramatic fashion. Their levels of UCP1 doubled within eight hours of the treatment. The change in UCP1 also proved to be reversible: Its level returned to normal once the cells’ temperature was set at 37 degrees. But in brown fat cells, no induction of the protein was observed, indicating that cold temperatures don’t mobilize these cells by flipping this particular switch. The researchers also found that white fat cells obtained from mice lacking receptors for norepinephrine were still able to respond to cooling by turning on UCP1 — showing that the heat-generating pathway is both specific to those fat cells and independent of the sympathetic nervous system. The finding won’t lead to an anti-fat pill any time soon, Spiegelman says, but it does give scientists new avenues to explore. “It’s a piece of the basic science, adding to an evolving awareness that fat cells have many lives that we never knew about. Now we know they can sense temperature directly. The next question is: How do they do it, and can that ability be manipulated?” “The paper is filling in an emerging picture that adipose tissue can be a more flexible, adaptive organ than we once thought,” said Sven Enerback, a physician and adipose tissue researcher at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. “The finding raises the question of whether this new pathway has widespread effects on the animal as a whole.”",

    "source": "Yamaguchi murder suspect nabbed <eos> YAMAGUCHI - Police said Friday they have arrested the 63-year-old man sought in connection with the Sunday-Monday slaying of five people and the torching of two of their homes in the hamlet of Shunan, Yamaguchi Prefecture. The suspect, identified as Kosei Homi, was found barefoot and wearing only his underwear on an unused mountain trail Friday near Shunan. Upon being taken into custody, he confessed to the slaying of his five neighbors and the two cases of arson, the police said. Police launched a major manhunt for Homi after finding the five corpses, three of which were in the gutted homes. After the police found a cellphone and a shirt that apparently belonged to Homi at around 3 p.m. Thursday, they started combing the immediate area. Despite some scratches, Homi was in good health, the police said. When they found him, Homi confirmed his identity and reportedly told them: “I wanted to die, but I failed.” The police suspected Homi in connection with the crimes, because he had not been seen since Sunday and he lived next door to one of the victims. The bodies of Makoto Sadamori, 71, and his wife, Kiyoko, 72, and that of Miyako Yamamoto, 79, were found in their homes, which had been gutted. The two houses, about 80 meters apart, both started to burn at around 9 p.m. Sunday. Homi lived next door to Yamamoto. The police suspected the two homes were torched soon after the victims were killed. On Monday, police found two more bodies, those of Satoko Kawamura, 73, and Fumito Ishimura, 80, in their homes, even though they had reportedly confirmed that Kawamura was safe Sunday night. All of the victims died instantly of blunt-force head trauma. The police searched Homi’s house for evidence. Earlier they found two cars in his garage, leading them to believe he had fled on foot. It was earlier reported that the police also found a message in a form of a haiku inside a window of Homi’s house that read: “Tsukebishite kemuri yorokobu inakamono.” (“Setting on fire, smoke gives delight, to a country fellow.”) The hamlet where Homi and the five victims lived consisted of only eight households and 14 residents. According to other neighbors, Homi did not interact well and once left the community to live in Kawasaki. After he returned, he would not exchange in any form of greeting, they said. Homi reportedly proposed a project to develop the area, but his plan was rejected by his neighbors. Some also said he had troubles with them over his dog. During the 2011 New Year’s holiday, Homi reportedly complained to police, saying, “I’m being bad-mouthed by other people in the community and feel isolated.” After having a conversation with officers for over an hour, he said he felt relieved and returned home, the police said. According to sources, instead of trying to improve relations with others in his community, Homi installed a fake security camera and pretended to be monitoring the home of Yamamoto. He also hung the malicious haiku.",

    "source": "Beware your heroes and heed the lesson of stargazer Galileo Galilei <eos> A scene from “The Life of Galilei” seems to encapsulate the dilemma Japan faces as it gropes for new leadership. “Woe betide a nation without heroes.” “Not so. Woe betide a nation in need of heroes.” This exchange from the play by anti-establishment German playwright Bertolt Brecht is a traumatic one in which Galileo Galilei returns from his encounter with the Grand Inquisitor. (The production I saw was in Japanese. The translations are my own.) The latter has managed to convince the scientist to rescind his views on celestial dynamics and shut up about the earth moving round the sun. It turns out that even the great Galileo is susceptible to threats when they are accompanied by a display of the latest advances in torture tools. The above lament over the lack of heroes is an utterance of Master Galileo’s foremost student, who did not believe even for a moment that his great tutor would capitulate. Master Galileo may or may not be just another coward. He may or may not have been putting on a show of compliance to ensure he could continue making his discoveries in secret. We never quite find out. Either way, his view on heroes is not wrong. It is highly astute. There seem to me to be two types of nations that feel a need for heroes. Neither variety is a happy one. First, there are nations whose people are oppressed. When people are being deprived of their basic human rights, arrested without proper reason, detained without trial, put to torture and massacred en masse, they are indeed in need of heroes who can come to their rescue. Unfortunately, there are still far too many nations around the world that fall into this category. That is why human rights activists have to be active and people have to revolt. Second, there are nations who have lost their self-confidence. They are confused. Nothing seems to go right for them anymore. They do not know what to believe. They do not know what to do. They keep looking back into the past in quest of an image of themselves they are comfortable with. They cannot face reality because it does not have a face that they recognize. They want somebody to tell them what to do. Japan seems to me to fall into this second category of hero-seeking nations. Thus people are apt to bemoan the lack of leadership and the absence of leaders in politics as well as management.¥ This mentality is dangerous. When people are in this frame of mind, they fall prey to charlatans and populists. Master Galileo’s warning against heroes sounded particularly pertinent to our situation as we went to the polls on Sunday. Toward the end of Brecht’s play, I was struck by another series of utterances by Master Galileo that seemed to reach out to the Japanese condition. “It is my belief,” says the Master, “that science exists for the single purpose of making the condition of survival less painful for the human race. Should scientists be goaded by greedy leaders into pursuing knowledge for knowledge’s sake, science will become maimed and all the new machinery you make might merely end up creating more pain. . . .” When one thinks of how painful survival has become for so many in the aftermath of 3/11, it is easy to realize how words like these would resonate severely with a Japanese audience. The powers that be who are in such a hurry to restart the nation’s nuclear power plants would do well to heed Master Galileo’s words. If a visit to the theater can deliver a dose of common sense to all aspiring heroes in need of enlightenment, they just might be in for a surprise.",

Tepco officials said Tuesday they plan to hire about 100 new recruits next April. They will be students due to graduate in March from technical high schools, universities and graduate schools. Some offers have already been made, the officials said. The utility had hired up to about 1,000 new recruits every year through fiscal 2011. But after the Fukushima No. 1 catastrophe, Tepco refrained from hiring new employees two years in a row.

Aside from the planned hiring of 100 new graduates, Tepco is set to offer about 50 jobs in Fukushima as part of its effort to help improve employment conditions there. Tepco had planned to hire about 500 new graduates next April 2014. But because the utility was required to further streamline operations before increases in household electricity rates were approved, it decided to limit new hiring mainly to essential technical personnel. As Tepco has been cutting wages sharply and its business prospects remain uncertain, there is a possibility that students may spurn any job offers. “I am worried how many will actually join, but hope as many people as we need will enter our company,” a senior official said.",

Tian’s unsettling behavior continued Tuesday, when the 58-year-old Chinese national made her first appearance in D.C. Superior Court to face charges in connection with a string of vandalism in which churches and tourist attractions across the city were spattered with green paint. Tian refused to cooperate with the D.C. police department’s Asian Liaison Unit, according to officials at her court appearance. She wouldn’t say where she stayed in Washington. She told police that she had lived in Los Angeles, but prosecutors said they could find no evidence of that. She speaks little or English. Her visa to visit the United States expired three days ago. As authorities investigate crimes that marred the Lincoln Memorial, a statue of the Smithsonian’s first secretary and sanctuaries in two churches — one with a toxic mixture of paint, urine and feces — it may be as challenging to understand who Tian is as it will be to determine a motive for the vandalism. D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier said Tuesday the suspect may have “mental health issues.” D.C.

    "source": "Tepco trying to keep radioactive water from reaching sea, but can it? <eos> Tokyo Electric Power Co. only recently admitted radioactive water is flowing from its crippled Fukushima No. 1 plant into the Pacific. Although Tepco is giving assurances that it is taking and planning steps to prevent more tainted groundwater from reaching the sea, it’s unclear how effective those efforts are, considering the difficulty of even pinpointing the problem. Here are questions and answers regarding the tainted flow. When was the leak noticed? According to Tepco, the utility began more closely monitoring the radiation levels of groundwater in wells 25 meters from shore in May. In June, the utility announced it had detected high levels of radioactive material in the groundwater taken from the wells near the reactor 2 turbine building. Though the groundwater flows toward the sea, Tepco initially ruled out the possibility it was reaching the Pacific. Last week, it finally changed its tune. The firm said data showed the well water levels were changing with the tides, indicating the seawater and the groundwater are intermingling. How did the groundwater become radioactive? Inside trenches connecting the reactor 2 turbine building and a pump room right by the shore, there are pipes to carry seawater for cooling as well as electrical cables. Since the start of the Fukushima crisis, tainted water has accumulated in these trenches, which rest on highly permeable gravel. Experts believe radioactive water is leaking from cracks in the trenches and passing through the rushed rock, reaching the groundwater. “It’s very important information that there is crushed rock (under the trenches),” Kunihiko Shimazaki, a commissioner at the Nuclear Regulation Authority, told an NRA meeting last week. Tepco also suspects that residual water from a leak of highly radioactive water that reached the Pacific through a section of the trenches in April 2011 may be a source of the groundwater contamination. A sample taken last Friday from the trench contained 750 million becquerels of cesium-134, 1.6 billion becquerels of cesium-137 and 750 million becquerels of other radioactive substances, according to Tepco. A sample from April 2011 contained 1.8 billion becquerels of both cesium-134 and cesium-137 per liter. Meanwhile, the basement of the turbine building is flooded with the tainted water from a leaking containment vessel. Radioactive water there is possibly leaking into the trenches connected to the basement. How much radioactive water has flowed into the sea? Tepco said it is unclear how long tainted water has been leaking into the sea — or how much. It continues to claim that the contamination of the sea is limited to the plant’s port. What is Tepco doing to stop the flow? Tepco is trying to remove the source of contamination and block the flow of the tainted groundwater. It is currently injecting liquid glass between the reactor 2 turbine building and the sea, hoping the glass will serve as a wall to stop the groundwater from reaching the Pacific. Tepco also plans to build a wall in the immediate harbor to contain the radioactive water. Its construction won’t be completed until September 2014. The utility is also planning to remove and process the tainted water in the trenches and backfill a part of them with filling materials. Are such measures enough to end the problem? Experts remain uncertain. “The underground situation is complex. It’s not necessarily easy to figure out,” said Shigeaki Tsunoyama, president of the University of Aizu, one of the NRA panel members monitoring the Fukushima No. 1 plant. “Building walls seems simple in a drawing, but when you think about a complex underground structure, it won’t be that easy,” he said, adding that it is still not certain where exactly the contamination is coming from. Although it is a difficult job, Tsunoyama said Tepco should try to figure out what is really going on underneath the plant. The NRA also urged Tepco to dig more wells to determine how far the radioactive groundwater has spread. Reactors 1, 2 and 3 all suffered core meltdowns, and unit 4’s building was destroyed in a hydrogen explosion, exposing its spent-fuel pool. There are monitoring wells around the other damaged reactors, but unit 2 appears to so far be the only area where radioactive groundwater is showing up.",

    "source": "Lightning kills one as rainy season's exit kicks up storms <eos> Two lightning strikes left a man dead and a woman injured Monday as the sudden departure of the rainy season and a high-pressure system from the Pacific sent temperatures soaring in much of the nation. In Tokyo, three men in their 50s and 60s were struck by lightning near the Arakawa River in Kita Ward after a thunderstorm developed, leaving one dead, police said. According to witnesses, the three were hit while sheltering under a tree at around 3:50 p.m. Police are still trying to identity the dead man. A woman in nearby Saitama Prefecture was later knocked unconscious in a separate lightning strike in Tokorozawa at around 5:15 p.m. The woman, 53, was struck while working on a farm and remains unconscious, police said. The Meteorological Agency said temperatures soared well into the 30s in much of the nation after active convection currents near the Philippines stimulated a high-pressure system in the Pacific earlier than usual. It also said the rainy season had come to a premature ending virtually nationwide, two days after declaring it over in the Kanto-Koshin region, which includes Tokyo. Areas in the north, the northeast and the Sea of Japan side of central Honshu are still getting rain. In regions southwest of central Japan, the rainy season ended six to 13 days early. Predicting highs of over 35 in many places, the weather agency issued a high-temperature advisory warning people to stay hydrated and to use air conditioning to prevent heatstroke. By Monday morning, the mercury had hit 36.2 in Kamikitayama, Nara Prefecture, 36 in Tajimi, Gifu Prefecture, 35.8 in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, and 35.7 in three cities in Yamanashi, Kyoto and Tottori. On Sunday, the heat wave caused the death of a 50-year-old man and sent at least 740 other people to the hospital due to overheating. The man who died was in the city of Shikokuchuo, Ehime Prefecture, when he was taken to a hospital. He apparently died of heatstroke. Heatstroke can usually be confirmed by a core body temperature above 40.5 degrees, but fainting may also be a symptom. Other clues include headache, dizziness, failure to sweat, cramps or nausea, rapid pulse or breathing, or even seizures. According to local police and fire stations, 10 junior high school students taking part in a baseball game in Saitama Prefecture were taken to a hospital on Sunday after exhibiting symptoms of heatstroke. Marathoners were also affected, with six runners in Aomori Prefecture and others in Tottori hospitalized. Off the coast of Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture, a 15-year-old boy drowned, while in the city of Gero in Gifu Prefecture, a 10-year-old girl and her 4-year-old brother were swept away by the Hida River. Both siblings were washed away when the girl tried to rescue her brother after he slipped into the river.",

    "source": "Cashing in on Fuji fever <eos> Since the announcement that Mount Fuji, Japan’s most iconic landmark, had finally won World Heritage status on June 23 , Fuji fever has swept the nation. As souvenirs commemorating the event hit the shelves, sales of Fuji-themed merchandise were brisk. Stores selling climbing gear to those who have been inspired to make the pilgrimage up Fuji have also been doing well. Loft in Shibuya reported that sales of Fuji merchandise, which had been growing steadily prior to the announcement, suddenly shot up by 150% — the bestselling item being a Fuji-san folding fan that retails for ¥2,100. They’re not anticipating a downturn in trade either: When the shop gets a refit in September there’s going to be a special area in the new “Japan Souvenir” floor dedicated to Fuji souvenirs. New products also went on sale to commemorate the occasion. Among these is a Mount Fuji wooden cup and ball game that costs a rather eye-watering ¥6,090, and a rubber stamp that incorporates elements of the famous 36 views of Mount Fuji , which would set you back ¥3,360. In addition, blue traffic cones with a snow capped peaks have suddenly popped up in car parks around the country. Formally sold mainly to businesses in the area around Mount Fuji, 300 of these cones were sold in the last month, three times the amount of typical annual sales. The climbing season for Mount Fuji began this month and shops selling climbing equipment have been cashing in. Sales have also been boosted by the inspiring news back in May that 80-year-old Yuichiro Miura managed to scale the summit of Everest . Mizuno outdoor sports told Sankei Biz that sales of hiking gear for women are almost double that of last year, an indication that the yama girl trend is continuing to climb. Mizuno outdoor sports store also runs hiking schools and a trip to Mount Fuji for July sold out almost as soon as it went on sale. But hordes of hikers heading for the mountain are putting a strain on local infrastructure. The authorities of Fujinomiya, one of the gateways to the mountain, have announced that the toilet facilities available will not be sufficient to deal with the increased volume of hikers and are asking climbers to take their own portable toilets with them. While toilets will be in short supply, Wi-Fi access in the area ought to be excellent. As of June, Yamanashi, one of the prefectures Fuji is located in, has 933 free Wi-Fi spots . Visitors surfing the web might want to download a free new app from Fuji-san Beno , which tells you what events are going on in the area during the day of your visit. More info can be found at Fujiyama Navi . The site launched July 8, and offers tours, hotels, and, of course, Fuji-themed merchandise.

    "source": "Effects will become more obvious as Japan's climate changes <eos> Residents of Japan’s big cities, and of Tokyo in particular, are well aware of the heat-island effect — especially now with the onset of summer. The effect occurs because concrete and asphalt retain radiant energy, making the whole city a vast absorber and then emitter of convected heat, which creates powerful thermals that trigger sudden “guerrilla storms” — and renders the nights barely more agreeable than the stifling, claggy days. And if you think summers have been getting worse — you’re right. Figures from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) show that annual average air temperatures nationwide rose by a rate equivalent to 1.15°C per century between 1898 and 2010. This is considerably higher than the global average temperature rise of 0.74°C over the last century (according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s “Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers”). Not only have temperatures been rising in Japan, but they’ve been rising faster here than they have elsewhere — with some of that difference accounted for by the heat-island effect found in cities and dense urban areas. I’ve just been looking at the first comprehensive report into the impacts of climate change in Japan. A few points jump out: Plants are flowering earlier each spring and, counterintuitively, insects are appearing later — perhaps because their pupal stages need a certain period of chilling in order to develop, so with winters getting warmer they take longer to develop. In addition, species’ ranges — the physical areas they inhabit — are expanding northward by between 18 km and 140 km per decade. That report’s lead author is Yuko Ogawa-Onishi, who works at my old research base, the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture, and at the University of Oxford. Ogawa-Onishi, with colleague Pam Berry at Oxford, reviewed as many publications as they could about observed and projected impacts of climate change in Japan, using both local and international publications. By reviewing JMA weather-station data, the pair found evidence that the heat-island effect also occurs in relatively small cities. However, they point out that urban and industrial areas of Japan cover only 5 percent of the land area, while mountains, forests and agricultural regions account for more than 80 percent — so heating due to urbanization can only have a limited effect. As for future conditions in Japan, they found some predictions suggest that, by 2100, temperatures are likely to increase by 2°C to 3°C (relative to a baseline average temperature between 1981 and 2000) — with summers getting wetter, and other seasons drier. That’s bad, but a more pessimistic prediction — and by that I mean a mathematical model, not something someone has read in their tea leaves — has Japan’s mean temperature increasing by a whopping 4.8°C by 2100, with a 10 percent increase in rainfall. Ogawa-Onishi and Berry’s report appears in the journal Biological Conservation (DOI: 10.1016/j.biocon.2012.06.024) — but what do its findings mean for iconic Japanese natural phenomena? For cherry blossom, we’re looking at flowers coming 2.2 days earlier per decade. The first cicadas will sing 2.5 to 4.3 days later per decade. The Great Mormon swallowtail butterfly ( Papilio memnon , okay so it’s not really iconic, but I like it) will move 130 km north per decade. Likewise, Sika deer (of Nara photo-op fame) will move northward. “Plants and animals can adapt to climate change, but there is a limit,” says Ogawa-Onishi. “In southern Japan, we have already witnessed cherry trees not blooming after extremely warm winters, which indicates the limits to their adaptive capacity.” Most people in Japan are very aware of the changes in natural events, in particular, the flowering of cherry trees. Similarly, seasonal food is popular with most people in Japan, and they are aware that the availability of seasonal vegetables and certain fish at particular times of the year has changed. Some species can adapt, others can not adapt as well, says Ogawa-Onishi. Some things important to Japanese culture will certainly change. But the changes that Ogawa-Onishi and Berry explore aren’t just important for pretty national emblems. Japan is a biological hotspot. With more than 90,000 species of fauna, flora and fungii in an area of 380,000 sq. km, it is a globally important biological region (which was one of the reasons I went to study insects in Japan — there are so many of them, and there are some very cool ones). However, a major impact will be on the rice harvest, which will suffer a decrease of up to 40 percent in central and southern Japan. So rice imports will increase. And, although if you travel around Japan you will find a profusion of paddy fields in rural areas, specialist foods everywhere you go, and every town seemingly famous for a certain fruit or fish — some 60 percent of the nation’s food is actually imported — and that proportion is set to rise. For comparison, the United Kingdom imports about 25 percent of its food, and the United States exports more food than it imports. In the face of this sort of ominous news, Oxford scientist Berry says there are easy ways to get involved and influence things for the better. She cites both the kind of steps that help reduce (mitigate) our impact, and ones that help adjust to the effect of climate change. “There are simple mitigation actions that involve the use of less fuel, for example turning down the thermostat in winter or using less air conditioning in summer,” she says. Such advice may sound obvious, but a difference of 1°C can save about a ton of carbon emissions a year. Meanwhile, switching off electronic devices rather then leaving them on standby can save 15 percent of a household’s energy bill. “Every little helps, and if enough people did these things there could be a real difference,” says Berry. And there are ways to help species adapt to the effect of climate change. “People can help biodiversity by leaving some wild areas in their garden or planting wildflower mixes,” says Berry. And she calls for us to make sure there are “permeable” areas in our towns and cities, and to plant trees and generally “greenify” our urban jungles.",

    "source": "Data show twisters form over Kanto in September <eos> Damage to people and property by tornadoes made headlines over the past week, with the latest in Tochigi Prefecture injuring three people while destroying houses and other buildings. Here are some questions and answers regarding twisters: Are twisters common in Japan? About 17 were observed each year between 1991 and 2006, according to statistics compiled by the Meteorological Agency. That number is just a mere fraction of the roughly 1,300 that typically form every year in the United States, but when taking into account the amount of area covered, it would be inaccurate to say tornadoes are rare in Japan, the agency warns. Although Tochigi, Saitama and Chiba prefectures, all located in the Kanto region, were struck by tornadoes in the past week, twisters have occurred from Hokkaido to Okinawa. The tally from 1961 and 2006 shows that September is the peak month, with 1 p.m. being the most likely time of day for a tornado to strike. Geographic and weather conditions in the Kanto region are favorable for tornadoes. The mountainous region to the west, the humid hot air coming in from the Pacific and cooler wind coming in from the north this time of year all help. The Meteorological Agency has confirmed that weather conditions were nearly identical when the tornado touched down in Saitama and Chiba on Monday and when the Tochigi tornado hit Wednesday. Have there been more tornadoes in Japan recently? The Meteorological Agency states it is difficult to tell whether tornado counts have risen in recent years because the survey methods continue to change. Occurrences also vary every year and there are no consistencies. There were 28 tornadoes and/or microbursts, a strong, localized downdraft also known as wind shear, in 2012, 15 in 2011, 37 in 2010 and 23 in 2009, according to the agency. How do tornadoes form? The agency said that because they form so suddenly, the mechanism of how they are created is still not completely known. A collision of warm, humid air with a cooler, dry front causes a spiral ascension of the wind. Soaring cumulonimbus clouds also play a role in the formation of tornadoes, especially supercells with mesocyclones. Because atmospheric conditions are the key ingredient, twisters can form not only over open land but also in areas like Tokyo with skyscrapers. What are supercells? A supercell, which spawned Monday’s tornado, is a giant cumulonimbus that is capable of causing massive damage. Supercells are so huge that they differ “from ordinary thunderstorms in that the rotation of their updraft enables them to overcome the self-limiting mechanisms that bring demise to regular storms,” according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Has Japan seen any particularly devastating tornadoes? On November 7, 2006, a tornado touched down in Saroma, Hokkaido, at about 1:30 p.m. It struck buildings near a construction site, lifting some into the air and killing nine people. What is the Fujita scale? The Fujita scale is a measurement of tornado intensity created by the late meteorologist Tetsuya Fujita, a Japanese native who did his research at the University of Chicago. The New York Times wrote in Fujita’s obituary in 1998 that he “devised the standard scale for rating the severity of tornadoes and discovered the role of sudden violent downbursts (microbursts) of air that sometimes cause airplanes to crash.” Fujita, who died at age 78, was known to many as the Tornado Man or Mr. Tornado, according to the article. Fujita linked the damage caused by a tornado with its wind speed in his scale. According to his hierarchy, an F0 tornado boasts a wind speed of 17 to 32 meters per second and is strong enough to bend antennas or small branches on a tree. The strongest tornado on the scale is an F5, which can obliterate houses and lift automobiles and train cars with wind speeds that can reach 142 meters per second. The 2006 tornado in Hokkaido that killed nine people was classified as an F3. No F4 or F5 tornado has ever been recorded in Japan, according to the Meteorological Agency. Can the government issue better and quicker warnings for tornadoes? Signs that a tornado may be forming include darkening skies, hailstorms and even a jetlike roar. But some reports said fair conditions continued Wednesday until 10 to 20 minutes before the Tochigi tornado formed, so prediction remains difficult. The Meteorological Agency has been using radars to track wind movements inside clouds and began providing new forecasts for tornadoes and microbursts in 2008. However, records show that the agency has been able to accurately predict a tornado only 5 to 10 percent of the time.",

According to the Meteorological Agency, temperatures from Kyushu to the Kanto-Koshin region began climbing between July 6 and 8, when the rainy season ended unusually early. During the three-day period from July 10 to 12, the mercury exceeded 35 degrees at more than 100 of the 927 observation points across the country. The heat wave subsided in late July but resumed on Aug. 7 — the first day of autumn under the lunar calendar — and continued for 16 days with temperatures above 35 degrees at more than 100 points. The hottest day of the summer was Aug. 11, when temperatures in 297 places topped 35 degrees. On Aug. 12, the mercury hit its highest ever in Japan — 41 degrees — in Shimanto, Kochi Prefecture, which baked above 40 degrees for four days through Aug. 13. In step with the elevated temperatures, the number of people hospitalized for heat stroke also rose.

    "source": "Fukushima: health disaster or PR fail? <eos> One thing about having a nuclear accident in a rich country is that at least there is going to be good medical care and long-term monitoring. The repair and clean-up operation is another matter, of course — which is why Japan is currently under pressure to accept help from abroad in fixing the appalling mess caused by the three reactor meltdowns at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant. But having great monitoring, assessment and medical treatment of citizens is one thing. It is quite another making sure information is communicated to the public clearly and openly. That is something at which neither the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co. (Tepco), nor the Japanese government have succeeded at all well. And without good communication, fear and misinformation about radiation can understandably grow. I was talking about this last week with Gerry Thomas, who runs the Chernobyl Tissue Bank (CTB) at Imperial College London. The CTB collects and analyzes samples of tissue from people exposed to radiation after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the USSR (present-day Ukraine) in 1986, and monitors the occurrence of thyroid cancer in contaminated areas. About Fukushima, she is dismissive of the health risks. That might seem cavalier to people in the Tohoku region of northeastern Honshu who are worried about radiation contamination, but Prof. Thomas has seen what happened in Chernobyl — which released far more radiation than Fukushima has to date. “Fukushima is nothing compared to Chernobyl,” she told me. “It really is nothing, it’s a tenth of the dose of cesium.” (For the World Nuclear Association report on this, see bit.ly/17urZKd ) The problem in Japan, she says, is more one of communication than public health. “They’ve got a huge problem out there — largely a PR problem; it’s not a health problem because none of this is going to do anything health-wise,” the professor said. Our conversation came about because I’d seen a news clip on NHK reporting 18 cases of thyroid cancer in a monitored population around Fukushima. Fukushima Medical School monitors some 360,000 people who were aged 18 or younger at the time of the March 11, 2011, Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami. What you might conclude from the report — but you’d be mistaken — is that there is a direct link between the cases of cancer and the release of radioactive material following the meltdown. I asked for Thomas’ opinion. What we don’t know, she told me, is whether these thyroid cancers are to do with the environment in Fukushima — or whether there is something about the genetics of the people monitored. We also don’t know, she pointed out, whether the frequency is similar to that seen in other areas of Japan. In Chernobyl (where children were exposed to more than 100 times the maximum dose of radioactive iodine seen after Fukushima), thyroid cancers did not present themselves until four or five years after the disaster. “Given what we know about radiation dose and time elapsed since the accident,” says Thomas, “I personally cannot see how this finding can be related to the radiation — the doses were too low and the time too short, based on what we know from Chernobyl.” She directed me to a recent scientific paper reporting the results of radiation monitoring of adults and children around Fukushima. The paper, published in Proceedings of the Japanese Academy, Series B (which you can see for yourself; DOI reference: 10.2183/pjab.89.157), reports on the whole-body radiation screening of nearly 33,000 people. “Internal exposure levels of residents are much lower than estimated,” write Ryugo Hayano and colleagues of the University of Tokyo. In the town of Miharu, about 50 km from the stricken power plant, Hayano’s team monitored 95 percent of schoolchildren (aged 6-15). The radioactive cesium in the bodies of all the children was below the detection limit. In other words, they are emphatically not eating food contaminated with radiation. This sort of nonsensational, reassuring result isn’t something that will generally get reported by NHK or other media outlets. We are all exposed to radiation, all the time (this fantastic dose chart makes it clear: xkcd.com/radiation ) There is, however, a special fear of radiation that is introduced to the environment by human activities. But that fear can get out of hand. Far more radiation was released in the Chernobyl disaster than has been so far from the Fukushima plant, but even the Chernobyl disaster — the world’s worst — can be put into context. “If you compare Chernobyl with what we allowed to escape into the atmosphere as a result of the nuclear tests in the Nevada desert, that was far, far more than Chernobyl,” Thomas says. “We’ve got a short-term memory about things like this. Instead of looking back and saying, ‘What do we know from exposures in the past?’ we just panic about the next one.” Her advice: Talk to people. The Japanese authorities — whether officials from Tepco, the government or monitoring agencies, or academics — ought to be open and learn to communicate better. As Thomas puts it: “They have got to talk to the local population, they have got to talk to the fishermen, and they’ve got to make people understand that low levels of radiation don’t matter because we’re all exposed to it all the time.”",

    "source": "Pax No Man's Land needs more than Fed's tapering to smooth things over <eos> U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke hints at policy change. He is looking for an exit from quantitative easing whereby he has been buying financial assets to the order of $85 billion per month since the end of last year. He has emphasized the exit shall be a “tapering” procedure — no abrupt moves, no jumping on the brakes. Everything will be nice and gradual. Believe me. You really won’t see me go. I shall just fade away. And yet for all the care that has been taken to massage the markets’ fears, emerging economies are in turmoil. Capital is leaving their shores. Their stock markets have plummeted. Their bonds are losing value and their exchange rates are falling. There is much tension building in global financial markets, and it seems poised to snap once the summer holidays come to an end and people start getting back to work. Is this just one more case of America sneezing and everyone catching a cold? Are we still living in a world where “the almighty dollar, that great object of universal devotion” (Washington Irving) swings us about with its every move? So it seems, at first glance. And yet a more careful inspection suggests otherwise. John Connally, who was treasury secretary in the Nixon administration, famously remarked that “The dollar is our currency but your problem.” He said this to a bunch of grumpy European finance ministers who had come to complain about U.S. dollar policies and their inflationary effects on the rest of the world. That Connally felt he could say such things with impunity tells us a lot about how things stood back then. Mind you, he was not able to be so blase about his dollar policies for long. Shortly thereafter, the United States was forced into terminating the dollar’s gold convertibility. At that point, the dollar became at best a first among equals, rather than that “object of universal devotion” Irving remarked upon. Be that as it may, the point is that there was indeed a time when the U.S. could afford to stare the rest of the world down in the face of complaints and say “it’s your problem.” Those who are the center of their universe can say that sort of thing. Kings and princes can just go ahead and do whatever they like, and to hell with the consequences. People just have to cope. ‘Tis mine not to worry about others, yours not to tell me what to do but to take my actions as given. That is what living in Pax Americana was all about. But now we are living in a global era. This is Pax No Man’s Land. It is a place where if anybody sneezes, everybody catches pneumonia. The very fact that Bernanke has to talk about tapering and go to great lengths to ease market jitters points to the altered state of affairs: Bernanke cannot just say “your problem” any more, because if he stirs up too much commotion in the emerging world, the ripple effects will only too quickly come back to strike the U.S. economy — with a vengeance. Pax No Man’s Land is a precarious place. Nobody is really safe, but everybody has to have a hand in keeping it safe. The other alternative is for everyone to stop minding each other’s business. Everyone could impose capital controls, chase foreign capital — perhaps even foreign people — off their shores and be done with it. That would spell the end of Pax altogether, never mind whose. But that would never do. All currencies are now everybody’s problem. Everyone beware.",

    "source": "Japan increases TPP possibilities but not its own competitiveness <eos> Japan finally entered the trade talks for hammering out the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement during the 18th round last month in the Malaysian resort of Kota Kinabalu. The delegates joined the talks on the afternoon of July 23 after Japan’s participation was cleared by the U.S. Congress. The TPP is a framework that aims to liberalize trade in the pan-Pacific region. It started as an accord that was signed in June 2005 (and took effect in May 2006) by Singapore, Brunei, Chile and New Zealand with the goal of eliminating trade tariffs virtually without exception. Later, other countries including the United States, Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Peru negotiated to join, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced in March that Japan would take part as well. The international talks revolve around the conflicting interests of the parties. Resistance lingers in each to give up vested interests, and protections for Japanese farmers and U.S. automakers are two areas where the most heated debates are anticipated. Detroit’s recent bankruptcy filing, the biggest municipal bankruptcy in American history, could cast a shadow over the talks. On the other hand, consumers benefit a lot from being able to buy imported products on the cheap after tariffs are eliminated. It also must not be forgotten that Japan’s participation provides the following benefits to all parties. First, the sheer expansion in market size. With Japan’s entry, the combined gross domestic product of all the negotiating parties jumps from $18.8 trillion to $24.3 trillion. The bigger the market, the larger the opportunities to expand trade. Second is the expansion in potential benefits to the United States. Of the combined GDP of the 11 parties who entered the TPP talks before Japan, the U.S. accounted for a dominant share of 75.8 percent, followed by Canada (8 percent), Mexico (5.8 percent), Australia (5.4 percent), Chile (3.1 percent) and Malaysia (1.2 percent). The other five combined account for less than 1 percent. With Japan’s participation, America’s share drops to 58.5 percent, which means more opportunities for the U.S. to trade with the other TPP members. Third, participants other than the U.S. will now have a larger say in the negotiations. A country with a larger GDP share in the TPP market will have more influence over the negotiations, and the non-U.S. participants now account for 41.2 percent, compared with 24.2 percent before Japan entered. This is perhaps what everyone outside Uncle Sam expects Tokyo to bring to the talks. The fourth benefit is stability in the Asia-Pacific region, including China. Southeast Asia is becoming wary of China’s rapid ascent, which is being led by its military strength. At the moment, China, despite having the world’s second-largest GDP, is not qualified to take part in the TPP because of its various regulations, such as foreign exchange control. The expansion in the free trade bloc afforded by Japan’s entry will shed light on China’s true power and could ultimately press China to transform itself into a market economy with the same qualities as the TPP economies. Balancing the different interests of the negotiating parties will not be easy, but those obstacles need to be overcome in light of the benefits to be gained from a TPP deal. Last but not least, it must be noted that Japan, in order to actually join the TPP, needs to become more competitive. Each country’s requests for exceptions to the TPP’s overriding negotiating principle reflects their lagging competitiveness in the fields being protected.",

    "source": "Koda's baby gaffe may find different reception now <eos> Five years ago, singer Kumi Koda caused an uproar when she joked on a late-night radio show about how a woman’s amniotic fluid ( y ō sui ) becomes “spoiled” as she gets older. The subtext of the comment was the advantage of having babies at a younger age, but those quick to ridicule Koda’s lack of gynecological expertise (including this column ) fixated on what they saw as a swipe at women who put off having children due to careers and other exigencies of life. If Koda made the remark today, she might not receive such a negative response. Though amniotic fluid does not “spoil” as one gets older simply because it does not remain in a woman’s body over time, the notion that it is more difficult for older women to have children is now an intensely discussed health issue in Japan, where the birthrate continues to decline. And while Koda’s grasp of biology was flawed, her premise — that an essential feature of a woman’s ability to procreate becomes obsolete with age — wasn’t far from the mark. Ovarian follicles, which produce eggs for reproduction, are present in a female’s body before birth, and decrease in number as she gets older. Scientists estimate that the average girl has about 300,000 follicles at the onset of puberty, and thereafter loses about 1,000 with each menstrual cycle. When the number reaches 25,000, the chances of becoming pregnant drop considerably, which happens at about age 37, depending on the individual. This past spring, the government announced it would produce and distribute a handbook about pregnancy and childbirth for teenage girls in order to get them thinking about having children, but women’s groups objected to the implication that women’s only value to society lies in their ability to reproduce. The plan has since been shelved, but in a sense it had the desired effect, and not only on the targeted demographic. According to a recent article in Aera, an increasing number of working women in their 20s are seeking advice on in vitro fertilization later in life. Interest in the procedure was sparked by an NHK documentary aired late last year about the difficulties experienced by women over 35 when they try to conceive and bring a child to term. Aera says this interest has boosted the profiles of services that offer to freeze eggs. Women who think they may want children someday have their eggs extracted and stored so that they will have viable material if and when they do decide to become mothers. The government has not weighed in on these services, but a health ministry advisory panel is currently working on new guidelines for fertility treatments, which are not covered by national health insurance. However, the government does provide partial subsidies to married couples who undergo such treatments. At present there is no age limit for receiving the subsidy, only an income ceiling (¥7.3 million a year), and a couple can be reimbursed for up to 10 treatments over a period of five years. Subsidies were first made available in 2004, when 17,000 were granted. Last year, 135,000 payments were made for a total of ¥20 billion. The maximum amount of a single payment is ¥150,000, while the cost of IV fertilization is between ¥300,000 and ¥400,000. Since 2010 only 29,000 babies were born as a result of IV procedures covered by the subsidy. The new guidelines will take into consideration the effects of aging on childbearing. A woman’s chances of conceiving a baby drop from 1 in 5 at age 32 to 1 in 50 at age 43. In addition, the rate of miscarriage increases by 50 percent after 35. Consequently, the panel is recommending an age limit of 42 for the subsidy. Asahi Shimbun reports that the panel originally wanted to set the limit at 39, but 30 percent of subsidies now go to women over 40. In addition, the number of subsidies allowed for one couple would be cut from 10 to six, but the time period will be removed. The purpose of the revisions is to persuade couples to have children earlier, whether it be by natural or artificial means. But the operative word is still “couples,” and while the implied inclusion of men in the decision-making process might placate people who think that too much of the burden for increasing the birthrate is being shouldered by women, limiting the discussion to married people has had an effect the government probably didn’t intend. In all the Aera interviews, young women say they are interested in egg storage as a fallback measure. They want to do something now to increase their chances of conceiving later in life, but none are married. Nor do they have boyfriends (one does, but she doesn’t consider him husband/father material). Though they attend matchmaking sessions and are on the lookout for potential mates, they are too busy with work, and Aera implies this isn’t going to change. For one thing, men know about this biological-clock problem, too, and those who associate marriage with families are looking for younger mates, which would seem to mean the older these women become, the less their chances of getting hitched. If they still want to take advantage of their stored eggs when they’re older, many may end up doing it alone. Dr. Yasunori Yoshimura, a health ministry advisor, tells Aera that women need to be better informed of the drawbacks of the technology, but he also says the government has to look at the issue in a larger context. Sex education should not just be about contraception and STDs. It should also be about the “social environment” of having children, including a woman’s choice to give birth without a partner, something the government discourages by limiting subsidies to married couples. And according to a survey carried out by Asahi, many doctors advocate using national health insurance to pay for such treatment, though, of course, given the probability of success such a move would benefit health-care professionals more than it would the government. In the cold terms of cost-performance, maybe having kids isn’t worth it.",

He said the SDP can offer its nationwide network of local chapters to support a campaign to form a unified opposition bloc to counter the LDP. Earlier in the day, Murayama said on a TV program that it is important to create an opposition force that will keep the LDP’s “monopoly” in check until the next Lower House election. He also criticized Abe for omitting words of remorse for Japan’s wartime aggression during the ceremony last Thursday to mark Japan’s surrender in World War II. In the 1990s, as prime minister, Murayama issued a war apology that used terms like “remorse” — wording that subsequent prime ministers, including Abe from 2006 to 2007, annually voiced.",

The unusual intervention by the board drew flak from teachers and publishers. Prefectural high schools texts are typically selected by the schools themselves, subject to board approval. The board took issue with two textbooks by Jikkyo Shuppan Co. In explaining the flag and anthem law, the books say: “The government made it clear through Diet deliberations that the public is not mandated to raise the national flag and sing the national anthem. However, there are moves to force this on public employees in some local governments.” Kanagawa prefectural board of education chief Koji Gushiken told reporters the texts “contained lines not necessarily compatible with the thinking of the prefecture” and the board showed “good judgment” in curbing their use. The board has repeatedly said that raising the flag and singing the anthem are “obligations” for teachers, “(who are) not coerced.” Teachers nationwide, however, have been punished for not observing the national symbols during school ceremonies, and have sued. Jikkyo Shuppan’s textbooks have also been questioned by other boards of education, including in Tokyo, which said they are “inappropriate for use,” and Osaka, which claimed their “descriptions are one-sided.” Of Kanagawa Prefecture’s 144 high schools, 28 picked Jikkyo Shuppan’s book. The board requested their principals rethink the use of the textbooks, saying they would not get board approval because they are not in line with the prefectural policy. The 28 schools eventually opted for other textbooks. “The result of more than one month of deliberations was overturned in one day. Are we at the mercy of the prefectural board of education?” a social studies teacher in his 50s at one of the schools that dropped a Jikkyo Shuppan textbook asked. Last year, the board approved one of the Jikkyo Shuppan history books with an identical description about the issue and five schools are currently using it. The change in the board policy may be largely due to a Supreme Court ruling in April, one board official said. The court rejected a suit by Kanagawa teachers challenging on privacy grounds the prefectural policy of requiring principals to report teachers who do not stand when the anthem is sung at school ceremonies.",

Nagasaki Mayor Tomihisa Taue said in his letter that the latest testing “let down a lot of people and hurt the sentiment of the bombed places.” He then called on the United States to stop all nuclear tests and take the initiative in abolishing nuclear weapons. Hiroshima Gov. Hidehiko Yuzaki also sent a letter of protest to Obama saying the United States is supposed to play a leadership role in worldwide efforts to abolish nuclear weapons, but its action disrupts those efforts. Regrettable comment JERUSALEM JIJI Israel has expressed regrets over comments by a senior official that he was sick of “self-righteous” memorials for the victims of the 1945 U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japanese and Israeli officials said Tuesday. Yaakov Amidror, Israeli national security adviser, phoned Ambassador to Israel Hideo Sato and expressed regrets over the comments, said officials at the Japanese Embassy in Tel Aviv.

    "source": "'Barefoot Gen' pulled as anti-war images strike too close to home? <eos> The decision by the board of education of Matsue, Shimane Prefecture, to limit students’ access to the manga series “Hadashi no Gen” (“Barefoot Gen”) at school libraries continues to cause a stir. While some support the move, others say it disrespects the best-selling anti-war classic, which tells the story of a young boy who survives the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Meanwhile, it was reported Wednesday that a public library in Tottori Prefecture had also pulled the series from its shelves a few years ago over concerns about its graphic content. Here are some questions and answers regarding “Hadashi no Gen” and the controversy surrounding it: What’s the history of “Hadashi no Gen”? The series, by the late Keiji Nakazawa, first appeared in Shukan Shonen Jump, a weekly comic magazine, in 1973. While most of the comics in the magazine depicted giant robots and other flights of fancy, “Hadashi no Gen” was the gut-wrenching survival story of a 6-year-old boy during and after the war, focusing on the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. “Hadashi no Gen,” which concluded in 1985, has been translated into more than 20 languages and adapted into TV series, plays, feature movies and musicals. Nakazawa himself was a hibakusha, having survived the 1945 Hiroshima bombing. He lost his father and two siblings that day. “I still remember the weight I felt when I picked up my younger brother’s skull,” Nakazawa said during a speech in Tokyo in 2007. “My wish is that the readers of the book continue their efforts to create a world without war and nuclear weapons,” he added. Nakazawa died of lung cancer last December. Why did the Matsue board of education limit access to the series? It began with a petition by city residents last August. Although “Hadashi no Gen” offers an anti-war message, it also contains graphic drawings of the atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, including rapes and beheadings of Chinese. Though the board’s decision was not unanimous, one member felt the series “escalates as it proceeds and starts to contain extremely violent sentences and graphics,” according to the transcript of one meeting. “It may not be the proper way to describe it, but (“Hadashi no Gen”) could be considered an inappropriate book.” Another member of the board disagreed, saying the manga “depicts the tragedy of war and importance of peace” and therefore should be available at anytime for anyone to read. According to a Kyodo report, a majority of the 49 elementary and junior high school headmasters in Matsue told the board they thought “Hadashi no Gen” was appropriate for school libraries. Nevertheless, the board decided to remove the series from library shelves and curb student access to it. What else about “Hadashi no Gen” is considered controversial? Gen and other characters in the series are often critical of the Emperor, at times calling him “a murderer.” They hold the late Emperor Hirohito responsible for the deaths of millions in Japan and across Asia. Gen at one point even goes so far as to say that if it weren’t for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Emperor and other leaders wouldn’t have ended a war already known to be lost. Was this the author’s belief? Criticizing the Emperor makes one an easy target of conservatives and right-wingers, but Nakazawa was known to make even bolder comments in real life. “I wanted to jump on him, considering that he killed my father and did so many things to us,” Nakazawa said in an interview with Hiroshima City University in 2007 describing how he felt when Emperor Hirohito visited the city in 1947. “I absolutely cannot tolerate the Imperial system. We need to question its existence,” he said. How has the author’s family reacted to the controversy? Nakazawa’s widow, Misayo, recently told the Saitama Shimbun that she was “surprised” by the actions taken by the Matsue board of education. The book was written “with utmost consideration to what should be read by the children,” she said, adding there “is no way to depict the war without any graphic images.” How has Hiroshima reacted to Matsue’s decision? Hiroshima Gov. Hidehiko Yuzaki was quick to criticize the move, telling reporters Tuesday it is “unnecessary” to regulate “Hadashi no Gen” and the series “has been read by many people for a long period of time as a reference on the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima.” Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui has also said that it is “important for the readers to witness the horrible drawings of atomic bombings and understand the need to prevent it from ever happening again.” Meanwhile, since its launch on Aug. 16 on Change.org , over 17,000 supporters have signed an online petition to reinstate “Hadashi no Gen” in Matsue libraries. What is likely to happen? The city of Matsue may not backtrack on its decision but is scheduled to hold a meeting with the board Thursday. Jiji reported Tuesday that the Matsue board of education may consider various options, including withdrawing the restriction to access the series, given the objections from various corners, quoting one of its board members, Nobuo Shimizu.",

    "source": "Cyberterror threat stalks Japan's high-end toilet users <eos> Cyberterrorists could strike at your most vulnerable and least expected moment because of a glitch in a smartphone-controlled high-tech toilet system manufactured in Japan. According U.S. security firm Trustwave, high-end Lixil Corp. toilets, which can be controlled with Android smartphones, could easily be hacked to allow anyone to “activate the bidet or air-dry functions, causing discomfort or distress to the user” via remote access. The glitch can further empower hackers to “unexpectedly open/close the lid,” the security firm warned. The latest toilet sold under Lixil’s Satis brand, which comes with a price tag of around ¥350,000, includes state-of-the-art technology for its heated seat, adjustable bidet and a built-in speaker. The product went on sale in February. Users can download to their smartphones the My Satis application, which enables them to control multiple functions — including the bidet location and power — while a Bluetooth connection can stream music from their phones over the toilet’s speaker. The toilet even enables users to keep a record of their bowel movements in a diary format “which will make it possible to easily comprehend your health status every month,” Lixil stated. But the bug discovered by Trustwave in the My Satis app means any third party could hijack the toilet’s functions. A spokeswoman for Lixil, based in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo, said Friday that there is no need to raise the alert level, assuring the glitch does not pose an imminent threat. For cyberterrorists to capitalize on the application flaw, they must first be able to pair their smartphone with the target toilet, and then remain a few meters close by to access its control system. A Satis toilet also doesn’t activate unless someone is seated on it, meaning a hacker wouldn’t be able to wastefully hose bidet water around while no one is using it.",

    "source": "Japan's nuclear comedy just goes on and on <eos> What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun. — Ecclesiastes 1:9 These words are said to have been penned by King Solomon around 3,000 years ago. Perhaps they were an augury of Japan’s nuclear industry. I’m sure somewhere there’s an original text that reads, “In the Land of the Melting Sun.” Here’s the basic pattern: An accident occurs in Japan’s nuclear industry; those in charge fail to deal with it well; people suffer; those in charge lie to the public; finally they admit it and apologize profusely. Then the cycle is repeated. The latest revelations of leaks from at least one of more than 1,000 storage tanks being used to store radiation-contaminated water at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co. (Tepco) are really nothing new; it’s just another in a series of follies being handled in an irresponsible and short-sighted way. True to form, while the media had been reporting on the problem for weeks, Tepco had denied it. Finally — and oddly, just after July’s Upper House elections — there was the admission, the obligatory apology, and an announcement by the Japanese government that it would come to the rescue. They say those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it — yet the patterns of mishaps in Japan’s nuclear industry that I write about are so reproducible as to give me a strange sense of déjà vu. We have been here before. The explosions and meltdowns of three reactors at Tepco’s Fukushima facility in March 2011, leading to massive leaks of radiation, comprised the world’s worst nuclear disaster since a reactor exploded at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the USSR (present-day Ukraine) in April 1986. In the northeastern Tohoku region of Honshu, where the Fukushima plant is located, more than 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate due to high radiation levels and the cleanup will likely take at least 40 years. Tepco at first blamed the accident on “an unforeseen massive tsunami” triggered by the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011. Then it admitted it had in fact foreseen just such a scenario but hadn’t done anything about it. A Special Diet Commission reporting in July 2012, and other studies, concluded that the earthquake alone probably damaged the cooling system of the Fukushima plant’s 40-year-old Reactor 1 so badly that, even before the tsunami, meltdown was inevitable because it would overheat so much. In other words, some of Japan’s nuclear power plants may be unable to withstand an earthquake. Not a comforting thought in a country that has constant seismic activity. Of course, “nuclear meltdown” itself was denied for months. Even up to May 2011, while the foreign media had long labeled the Fukushima disaster “a triple meltdown,” Tepco — and the national government — stonewalled, insisting that meltdown had not been confirmed. Then finally, just a week before members of an International Atomic Energy Agency investigation team were to arrive in Japan, the government and Tepco admitted the facts — with the usual ritual apologies. The current leakage problems at the Fukushima plant are even more baffling to those of us blessed with a memory. That’s because, in December 2011, the government announced that the plant had reached “a state of cold shutdown.” Normally, that means radiation releases are under control and the temperature of its nuclear fuel is consistently below boiling point. Great! Mission accomplished! Let’s go home. Unfortunately, though, if Tepco stops pumping coolant into the reactors to keep their temperature down, then they won’t be in “a state of cold shutdown” anymore. And thanks to the haphazard cleanup at the plant, even just a few rats can jeopardize that shutdown. Yes, rats — not Tepco executives, but real furry rodents. The plant is being run on makeshift equipment and breakdowns are endemic. Among nearly a dozen serious problems since April this year there have been successive power outages, leaks of highly radioactive water from underground water pools — and a rat that chewed enough wires to short-circuit a switchboard, causing a power outage that interrupted cooling for nearly 30 hours. Later, the cooling system for a fuel-storage pool had to be switched off for safety checks when two dead rats were found in a transformer box. Perhaps there’s a secret Tepco PR manual 101: When in doubt, blame the rats. However, the words of a top Tepco exec should be of some comfort: “I wish to express regret for the recent cases of misconduct at our company, which eroded public confidence in the nuclear power industry. We will do everything … to prevent similar incidents and to maintain safety. We will promote release of information in order to reassure the general public that we are making sincere efforts, and to convince them that ‘Tepco is trustworthy’ again.” All very well — but those remarks were made in 2003 by then Tepco Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata after the company admitted to extensive falsifying of safety records for more than a decade. The coverups included dangerous problems in a number of its aging nuclear power plants. At that time, the entire nuclear industry came under great scrutiny. Reform had come. And just to show lessons had been learned, there were further apologies in 2004, when five workers at Kansai Electric Power Co.’s Mihama nuclear plant in Fukui Prefecture were scalded to death by steam leaking from a corroded pipe that hadn’t been inspected since 1976. Well, apologies are cheap; safety is expensive. Do you see the pattern? My guess is there is only one way to stop it, and that’s to finally pull the plug on Japan’s nuclear energy industry. We can only trust them to do one thing: place profits first, wreak havoc, lie about it and then apologize. But I don’t think that works so well anymore.",

    "source": "Only in Japan could a sword be 'life-giving' <eos> Few countries have broken with their past as sharply as Japan did. That was the price it paid for modernity. Japan in the mid-19th century had a beautiful, deep, highly refined culture that reached far down the social scale — but it was an ancient culture, not a modern one, artistic rather than acquisitive, helpless against encroaching Western powers that had already colonized much of the non-Western world and were hungry for the rest. Japan had only to look next door to China to see its own ghastly fate if it failed to match the West strength-for-strength. And so the past was shed. Japan became strong, rich — “Western.” When was the boundary crossed between Japan’s Oriental past and its “Western” future? A strong case could be made for the year 1876 — when the modernizing Meiji government (1868-1912) passed an edict banning the wearing of swords in public. “The sword is the soul of the samurai” — such was the proud declaration down the centuries. It is a weapon common to most early civilizations, but “there is no country in the world where the sword has received so much honor and renown as in Japan,” wrote Yokohama-based English diplomat Thomas McClatchie (1852-86), one of the first foreign students of Japanese martial arts. The sword figures in the earliest myths. Susano’o, the storm god, slays a people-devouring monster, extracting from its forked tail the sacred sword that became, together with a sacred mirror and a sacred jewel, one of the regalia of Imperial authority bestowed by the gods upon the nation’s first human ruler. Down to modern times, “The swordsmith was not a mere artisan,” wrote the Christian scholar Inazo Nitobe in “Bushido” (1900), “but an inspired artist, and his workshop a sanctuary. Daily he commenced his craft with prayer and purification.” The Japanese knew of firearms as early as the 1540s, when Portuguese traders brought them and did a very brisk business selling them. In Japan, though, the gun never displaced the sword, as it did in the West. Why? Numerous material factors can be cited — the shortage of firearms relative to the number of fighters; the unrelenting warfare of the time that favored tried and true techniques over uncertain experimental ones; the inconvenient length of time it took to reload a gun between firings. But the sense of the sword as more than a weapon — as a “soul” — was surely decisive. Old Japanese literature — philosophical, religious and military — refers frequently to “the life-giving sword.” Why “life-giving”? The sword is a lethal weapon, none more so than the Japanese sword, whose technical excellence is the marvel of connoisseurs worldwide. No one talks of the life-giving pistol, the life-giving atomic bomb, the life-giving drone. Where is the life in a death-dealing sword blade? The modern mind struggles to understand. Religion and martial ardor meet in the person of a Zen priest named Takuan Soho (1573-1645). An accomplished swordsman himself, he served as spiritual guide to the outstanding martial artists of his day, whom he taught along such lines as these: “The enemy does not see me. I do not see the enemy. Penetrating to a place where heaven and earth have not yet divided … I quickly and necessarily gain the desired effect.” That “desired effect” can only be the death of his opponent, but the death of a master swordsman at the hands of a master swordsman, tradition has it, is not death — certainly it is not murder — because the religious enlightenment that is prerequisite for true mastery places one beyond the illusory distinction between birth and death. “As long as a student of Zen entertains any kind of thought in regard to birth-and-death, he falls into the path of the devil,” explains a Zen master quoted anonymously by Zen priest Daisetz T. Suzuki (1879-1966) in “Zen and Swordsmanship.” Foremost among Japan’s master swordsmen is Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645), who lives on long after death in kabuki, bunraku (puppet theater), novels, manga, movies and television dramas. Musashi fought his first duel at age 13 and spent much of his life roaming the country matching skills with other masters. Japan’s centuries of civil wars were over by 1615. Peace held until 1894. But the “life-giving sword” was not to be suppressed by peace. Musashi fought 60 bouts in all, most of them fatal to his opponents. Does that make him a killer? Emphatically yes, in the eyes of some. He “elevated killing to a fine art,” writes historian Beatrice Bodart-Bailey in “The Dog Shogun” (2006). “His famous ‘Book of Five Rings’ consists of detailed instructions on how to kill quickly and effectively.” Bodart-Bailey will have none of the “life-giving sword” mysticism — but Musashi himself wrote, “I was unbeaten because I gave no thought to my life.” He was a dedicated student of Zen; also a poet, tea master, landscape gardener, town planner, writer and painter. To him, the artist was in a state of religious transcendence and all arts were one. Swordsmanship, to Musashi, and indeed to all swordsmen, was an art. In the Japanese tradition there is no “Thou shalt not kill.” If the 1876 anti-sword law stripped the samurai of their soul, it did not — nor did it intend to — pacify the national spirit. The notion of the “life-giving sword,” extended to embrace modern weaponry, survived into the 20th century. “There is no choice,” wrote Zen scholar Tomojiro Hayashiya (1886-1953) in 1937, “but to wage compassionate wars which give life to both oneself and one’s enemy.” We who can look back on World War II know what kind of “life” that meant.",

    "source": "Former leader of Japan's ruling party against raising defense profile <eos> Ahead of the anniversary Thursday of Japan’s surrender in World War II, former Liberal Democratic Party President and noted dove Yohei Kono expressed his views on constitutional revision proposed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other issues. Kono, 76, who was known for being the most dovish among LDP lawmakers, held such key posts as chief Cabinet secretary, foreign minister and Lower House speaker before retiring from politics in 2009. Abe is keen on revising the Constitution. The LDP, now headed by Abe, in its draft proposal defines the Self-Defense Forces as a national defense force, while allowing Japan to exercise the right to collective self-defense. What is your take on this? I do not see the need for revisions. If Japan modifies its Constitution to position the SDF as a national defense force and changes its defense guidelines to allow increased defense equipment, this would be encouraging neighboring nations to alter their defense programs. There is absolutely no need to set the stage for a never-ending arms race. There are views that the security environment surrounding Japan is changing, but this is exactly the time when more diplomatic efforts are needed. I understand that you have previously written about your wartime experiences, such as running to bomb shelters during air raids and your memory of listening to the broadcast of the voice of Emperor Hirohito (declaring Japan’s defeat). They are unforgettable experiences. Time has passed since the current Constitution was written and I now see a trend that takes (the war-renouncing) Article 9 lightly. We must go back to the basics and think properly as to why this kind of Constitution came to be. We must not forget the devastation and tragedy caused by the war. Article 9 demonstrates the fundamental spirit of Japan. There used to be LDP lawmakers who were opposed to constitutional revisions, but there seems to be no opposition these days. Why is this? What has made a big impact is that the Lower House is comprised of people elected in single-seat districts. Under such an election system, lawmakers can’t be endorsed by the party if they do not strictly adhere to the party’s pledges. Abe has recently indicated he supports changing the government’s interpretation that Japan can’t exercise the right to collective self-defense. What is your view on this? At first, the direction was to modify the Constitution (and enable exercising the right to collective self-defense). But since constitutional revision is not an easy task, it is now shifting to the reinterpretation of the Constitution. The procedure to change the interpretation can be done by a Cabinet decision, but wouldn’t that mean holding the Diet and the people in low account? It would inevitably lead to engaging in war if we exercise the right to collective self-defense, and it deviates significantly from the spirit of the Constitution. Voices are growing in the LDP criticizing the 1995 statement issued by Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama apologizing for Japan’s wartime aggression in Asia. What do you think about that? They must be asserting that the previous war was not a mistake, but such an argument can’t be accepted at home and abroad. It will raise Japan’s position in the international community if we admit what was wrong.",

A by-stander sounded the alarm, the engineer stopped the train, and an examination was made. Upon being informed that a man had fallen, all thought that he must have been killed or run over by the train. But fortunately, the man was not only not dead, but unhurt, as he fell just between the rails flat upon the ground and the train passed over him without touching him. 75 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Jan. 4, 1938 Yamato race must redistribute resources By Ryutaro Nagai, Communications Minister — The new idea that “a state is not a body comprising various factions with complicated and conflicting interests but a body with a common aim of fulfilling a noble cultural mission, and that a nation is not a mere materialistic existence chasing after its own interests but a spiritual existence obliged to make contribution for the welfare of humanity” seems to have penetrated through the minds of the people dissatisfied with a materialistic civilization. The supreme and noblest spirit manifesting the nucleus of “Japan Spirit” is the very basis of the national livelihood. The nation intends to adopt Western science, and systematize and adjust it with the spirit peculiar to Japan, thereby contributing much to the interest of the world. The mission of the Yamato race, I am fully convinced, is to work for the redistribution of the natural resources of the world and thereby prevent the majority of the people from falling into poverty and despair, as well as to emancipate humanity from the Communist menace now threatening the world. Communists always take advantage of the dissatisfaction arising from poverty. For the manifestation and enhancement of the “Japan Spirit” abroad, however, there is something to be done beforehand in this part of the world — the Orient. That is to reconstruct and rehabilitate the stricken Asian continent. We must first strengthen cooperation among Japan, Manchukuo and China, bound together as they are with a common civilization, establish a basic principle of sufficing one another from the standpoints of national defense and industries, check others’ malicious activities in the Orient and eventually build a new land for co-existence and co-prosperity among the three countries. It is exceedingly regrettable, however, that China under the Nanking regime has not only betrayed the other two in that great task but has also resorted to a policy of anti-Japanese resistance. Such being the situation, Japan was compelled to take arms against it. This is the origin of the current Sino-Japanese hostilities. Japan’s enemy, therefore, is not the Chinese people but the Government under General Chiang Kai-shek, who is dead to all sense of the shame of selling his country to others. Japan must continue its fight in China till it can stabilize the foundation of that nation. As for the Japanese people, they must be prepared to endure whatever sacrifice the country demands.

The mass production plan grew out of recognition that U.S.-made arms are too large for Self-Defense Force personnel and most are now obsolete. These arms were said to be inconvenient, especially where ammunition was concerned, because of the large variety of U.S. weapons. A new machinegun developed by the Technical Research Headquarters of the Defense Agency was claimed to be better than the U.S.-made models A4 and A6 now in use by the GSDF. A new rifle, tentatively known as model 64, also has been developed and is expected to be adopted officially by the defense forces next year. [The new machinegun mentioned here was eventually manufactured by Sumitomo Heavy Industries and thus became known as the Sumitomo Type 62. “Model 64” later became known as Howa Type 64. Both weapons became standard issue in the GSDF and continue to be used to this day.] 25 YEARS AGO Wednesday, Jan. 6, 1988 Two killed by falling disco chandelier Two women were killed and 15 others, including 11 women and four men, were injured when a two-ton chandelier fell on dancers at a disco in Tokyo’s Roppongi Tuesday night, the Tokyo Metropolitan Fire Board reported. The women were identified as Akemi Mizobe, 21, and Keiko Takagi, 26. When the rectangular-shaped chandelier fell around 9:40 p.m., about 200 guests at the Roppongi disco Turia were sent into mass pandemonium, an employee there said, adding that some of the victims were pinned under the light, while others caught fragments of flying glass. The chandelier, measuring three meters by two meters by one meter thick, fell about 10 meters, from the second floor ceiling to a basement where about 100 guests were dancing. The disco, located near the Defense Agency, is known for its selectiveness, with a video camera that monitors guests to determine fashionability.",

    "source": "How Japan's teens can avoid sleep demons <eos> Have you ever woken up but been unable to move; felt a powerful pressure holding you down, gripping you tight? Haruki Murakami has, and he describes it like this: “I was having a repulsive dream — a dark, slimy dream. … After I awoke, my breath came in painful gasps for a time. My arms and legs felt paralyzed. I lay there immobilized, listening to my own labored breathing, as if I were stretched out full-length on the floor of a huge cavern.” In this excerpt from the short story “Sleep” from his “The Elephant Vanishes” collection, Murakami is describing an episode of sleep paralysis, which is better known in Japan as kanashibari (literally, “bound in metal”). In other cultures, the experience has been attributed to a ghost (China and Korea), a demon feeding on the living (Fiji) and, in the southern United States, to a witch. People all over the world experience kanashibari, but with accounts going back at least as far as the kaidan (ghost stories) of the Edo Period (1603-1867), it has a particularly Japanese flavor. In Japan, too, the phenomenon seems to disproportionately affect young people, while homegrown horror films often play on a psychological fear of ghosts manifesting in the real world. It’s no surprise that these movies depict young people as being disproportionately affected by these apparitions. Fiction that may be, but in fact a nationwide survey of junior and senior high school students in Japan conducted in 2011 by Yoshitaka Kaneita of Nihon University School of Medicine in Tokyo, and colleagues, found that of the 90,081 questionnaires analyzed, 35.2 percent of respondents reported having nightmares, and 8.3 percent experienced kanashibari — compared with 6.2 percent of the general population in the United States who separate studies have found to report instances of kanashibari. The results of the Japanese survey — as reported in the journal Sleep Medicine (DOI reference: 10.1016/j.sleep.2010.04.015) — show that Kaneita and his team found a number of factors that seem to increase the chance of having a nightmare or experiencing an episode of kanashibari. For nightmares, they are: drinking alcohol, having trouble going to sleep, poor mental health — or simply being female, though there is little to be done about this factor. For kanashibari, males were found to be more susceptible than females, with their odds of affliction shortening more due to taking a long daytime nap, having an early or late bedtime — and again, having difficulty going to sleep and/or poor mental health. Kaneita’s team concluded that regular sleep habits are important to help prevent nightmares and episodes of sleep paralysis. However, Japanese high school students are often cited as being overloaded with work to the point that they have to get by on as little as four hours’ sleep a night. Indeed, in a separate survey of 3,478 Japanese high school students aged 16 to 18 (equivalent to 10th- through 12th-graders), researchers found that on average they slept for 6.3 hours, going to bed at 00:03 and rising at 06:33. As the evidence suggests that teenagers in both Japan and South Korea are more sleep-deprived than those in Western countries and China, Kaneita and his coauthors recommend that health education about regular sleep habits should be promoted among Japanese adolescents. Kanashibari — attributed to supernatural causes for centuries — may even shed light on the surprising mysteries of that most ubiquitous, beguiling and enjoyable of experiences: sleep. By monitoring volunteers in sleep labs, scientists have found that episodes of sleep paralysis occur when rapid-eye-movement (REM) stages of sleep overlap with waking stages. Nonetheless, for something so intrinsic to the human condition, sleep remains poorly understood. There are many explanations, and probably many are correct. Sleep has numerous functions. It helps regulate emotions (we’re invariably in a better mood after a good sleep); it helps us recharge and conserve energy; it helps the brain to process memory. Sleep also helps the automatic functioning of the body — the heart rate, breathing and hormone production. What seems to happen in kanashibari is that the person starts to wake up while REM sleep is still continuing. This leads to a situation where you are aware but “trapped” in a frozen body — because during REM sleep the muscles are paralyzed. We’ve all probably experienced moments of this intriguing and (to me) pleasurable feeling of the consciousness “floating,” unmoored to the body. But it’s only ever been a few seconds for me. If the feeling lasted for minutes or even hours, as it does for some unfortunate people, I can see how if could generate panic. It turns out that the brain becomes hyper-vigilant during these episodes, and can hallucinate a presence — a supernatural being, it may seem — holding them down. For some people it’s an evil cat, or a witch, or the bedclothes appear to become the twisted limbs of a dead body pressing on top of them. But let’s not end on such a horrific note. Consider, for instance, dolphins and seals: When they sleep, half the brain is dormant while the other half stays alert. What on Earth does that feel like? Perhaps dolphins have nightmares — being trapped in a cove by Japanese drive fishermen armed with spears, for example — but whatever their experience, it doesn’t last long: The sleep of marine mammals tends to occur in short bursts. Sweet dreams to all in this new year of 2013!",

    "source": "Okigusuri <eos> Dear Alice, I was on a two-week home stay in the countryside of Japan when a visitor came to the house. I don’t think he was expected, but my home-stay mother greeted him like an old friend and fetched a plastic drawer-box from the kitchen, which seemed to contain packaged medicines. While they chatted over tea, he went through the drawer counting packages and checking something on each package. He replaced certain products and seemed to recommend others, some of which went into the box. In the end, my home-stay mother paid what seemed to be a very small amount of money considering the amount of product left behind. They parted warmly and the box went back into the kitchen. She confirmed the products are medicine but otherwise couldn’t explain what the heck was going on. Can you? Gary K, Hong Kong Dear Gary, You witnessed a sales call for okigusuri , a uniquely Japanese method of marketing medicine, and one that has a history of well over 300 years. Here’s how it works: A variety of medicines are brought to your home and entrusted to you without any deposit or advance payment. You are given a free case in which to store them. There’s no obligation to buy anything but the medicines are there if you need them. And should the need arise, you may use anything from the box on the understanding that the next time the sales representative comes around, you’ll pay for only what you’ve actually used. In Japanese, this way of selling is called seny ō k ō ri (use first, pay later). Today, it is most strongly associated with medicine manufacturers in Toyama Prefecture, which together supply more than half of all okigusuri. This part of the country, located on the Japan Sea coast in the central part of the country, has had a high concentration of medicine makers ever since the Edo Period (1603-1867), when the area was called Etchu province. By the early 18th century, medicines from Etchu were sold throughout Japan, no small feat given the distances and strict restrictions at the time on travel and trade. The story goes that in 1690 the feudal head of the province, Masatoshi Maeda (1649-1706), was on a formal visit to Edo Castle when another lord fell seriously ill with a stomach complaint. Maeda immediately offered a remedy from his region, which he always carried with him, and it almost instantly relieved the man’s suffering. Impressed, the many lordly witnesses to this speedy recovery spoke to Maeda afterwards, asking that the medicine be made available in their own domains. Thanks to this official support, it became possible for medicine sellers from Etchu to enter other domains to peddle their products. The industry cooperated on distribution, dividing the country into 18 to 22 territories and assigning routes. Salesmen typically made two trips a year, carrying products in a set of nesting woven baskets tied to their back with a large cloth. To gain consumers’ trust for an unfamiliar medicine, they left their products with no advance payment and no obligation to use it. People often assume that the Etchu medicine manufacturers pioneered the “use first, pay later” method of sales, but recent research has confirmed that it was used even earlier for a variety of products, including cooking pots, hoes and mosquito nets. To find out how the okigusuri industry works today, I set up an appointment with Masao Inoya, immediate past chairman of the Tokyo-to Iyakuhin Haichi Kyokai (Tokyo Metropolitan Medicine Placement Association) and an okigusuri salesman with more than 60 years in the business. Inoya says he places medicines in both homes and offices, and generally visits each client two or three times a year to replenish supplies and collect payment for product used. When I asked what the salesman you observed was looking for on the packages, Inoya said he was checking the expiration date, because unopened but out-of-date product is removed and replaced at no charge. The average okigusuri box, which is called a haichi-bako or azuke-bako , he said, is kept stocked with 15 to 20 products worth something in the range of ¥7,000 to ¥10,000. Inoya said his rate of collection is very nearly 100 percent, and the industry has few problems with customers disappearing with the goods or refusing to pay. The actual selection of products varies by distributor and customer preference, but the typical okigusuri box will contain pain relievers, cold medicine, throat lozenges, stomach remedies and bottled health tonics. It usually also includes first-aid supplies such as bandages, disinfectant and shippu , which are packaged hot or cold compresses that may be treated with analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs. Inoya told me his particular area of strength is health-promoting medicines that people use even when they aren’t experiencing any particular symptoms. “I’m not selling medicine; I’m selling health,” he asserted. “So I have to be healthy myself.” And to show me just how healthy he is, Inoya, who is 77, got down and did the splits, sitting with his legs flat to the floor and straight out to the sides. That alone would have impressed me, but then he bent forward and touched his head to floor. Such health and flexibility must serve him in good stead, because he now has to travel a much wider area in order to maintain sales. “Unfortunately, sales of okigusuri are down,” Inoya explained. “When I started in the business, someone was home during the day in most households. And there were fewer stores in neighborhoods. But now more women work outside of the home, and there’s a drugstore on every corner. People just have more options for buying medicine.” Interestingly, the “use first, pay later” system has been introduced in developing countries to improve access to health care. With support from the Nippon Foundation, programs in Mongolia, Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam provide rural families with health education and cases of locally manufactured traditional medicines. The participating families can use the medicine if they need it, and pay only for what they use.",

    "source": "Unraveling the mystery of male birds' missing members <eos> How the chicken lost its penis: It sounds like a weird cousin of one of Rudyard Kipling’s “Just So Stories for Little Children” from 1902, which featured “How the Leopard Got His Spots” and “How the Camel Got His Hump.” But weird or not, this month we explore why almost all birds lack that flagpole of masculinity: the penis. Back when I was a postgraduate student, a biologist in the department where I worked had a quiet word with my adviser: “Your student,” he said, “is obsessed with animal genitalia. There’s something wrong with him.” My professor laughed it off. “That’s part of his PhD,” he said. “I’d be worried if he wasn’t thinking about sex all the time.” I’ll happily accept that there may well be something wrong with me. After all, I did spend several years looking at the sperm and the genital morphology of many different kinds of animals. But in my defense I’d say this: If that’s the case then there’s also something wrong with most evolutionary biologists. The evolution of sex, of male and female genders — and of the organs that accompany the act of procreation — pose fascinating questions for biologists. So they think about it a lot. That’s their excuse, anyway. I was reminded of that episode last week when I came across a scientific paper reporting on a study of how birds lost their penises. And yes indeed, in 97 percent of bird species, the males don’t have a member. It’s a vexing question for biologists, let alone our feathered friends. Nonetheless, these individuals are just as randy and strutting as males of other more well-endowed species — though the poor wretches have to make do with a cloaca, which is basically just an opening where you’d expect to find a penis. Now Martin Cohn and Ana Herrera of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Chevy Chase, Maryland, and colleagues, have found that chickens possess normally developing penises as early embryos. But then, as the birds develop, a genetic program swings into action and effectively chops off their little budding appendages. Think of it as a grim reaper just for males — though it’s achieved through the programmed, deliberate dying-off of cells. “Our discovery,” says Cohn, “shows that reduction of the penis during bird evolution occurred by activation of a normal mechanism of programmed cell-death in a new location, the tip of the emerging penis.” You may well ask: Why do we care? Well, it’s important to understand how this automatic cell-death mechanism operates because, if it fails to work when needed in the human body, it can lead to excessive or unregulated cell growth — and this can spell cancer. And there’s another reason: We care because we are “ obsessed with animal genitalia” and quite simply want to understand why birds don’t have penises. Herrera, the grad-student lead author of the study, who probably has a fixation like the one I had, says it’s not clear why chickens and other birds would have lost their penises. It might be down to aerodynamics: A flapping male phallus would not help in graceful flight. But Herrera has another interesting idea. It may be, she says, that the loss of a penis gives hens greater control over their reproductive lives. The natural evolutionary selection of females of the many species may, in other words, have driven the loss of the male’s pride and joy. How can that be? To find out, let’s turn to ducks. As alert readers will have noticed — and will likely be troubling over right now — I said that most male birds don’t have a penis. Some do — and boy, do they. Male ducks have giant, corkscrew-shaped penises. They use them to force females into having sex — you might have seen mallards chasing females of their species and jumping on them — which is what happens when the drake has an organ he can forcibly insert into the female. There’s not much a female duck can do to avoid a drake’s penetrative intentions, but over evolutionary time they have come up with something very clever to inhibit them. Hence the female’s reproductive tract is also corkscrew-shaped — but it twists the other way: The penis twists counter-clockwise, the vagina goes clockwise. So the females have evolved some measure of control over exactly where the male can put his penis, even if she can’t stop him inserting it in the first place. That’s because there are pockets and dead-end alleys inside her that prevent the penis growing to its full size. (If you’re a female duck you really don’t want that, as some drakes’ “manhood” can be as long as their body.) So female ducks have evolved quite elaborate countermeasures in response to the questing, unwanted penis. Yet how much easier if there wasn’t a penis at all! That is the case in the vast majority of bird species. Herrera and Cohn found that chickens have a gene known as Bmp4 that switches on at a certain stage in embryonic growth and culls the bird’s penis. In ducks and other enpenised avians, this gene stays switched off — as the results of their work, published in the journal Current Biology, show (DOI: dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.04.062 ) It appears that Bmp4 operates in mammals, too. What would happen — oh, horror — if it were switched on in the development of a human male? One can imagine a kind of reverse of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian 1985 Arthur C. Clarke Award-winning novel “The Handmaid’s Tale” — a version in which some crazed ruling class of women would have activated Bmp4 in men, causing them to lose their penises. The plot could center on a group of rebel women genetic engineers who restore men to their natural glory. I’d enjoy such a book — just as long as it remained in the realms of fiction.",

    "source": "The 'barbarians' were coming — like it or not <eos> ‘Sonn ō j ō i!” : “Revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians!” The writing was on the wall long before the wall crumbled. Japan’s splendid isolation — splendid in its own eyes — would no longer be accepted. The outside world was growing restless. Nations were reaching out, testing their strength, harnessing new technologies, trading, expanding, colonizing. Could Japan remain haughtily aloof? An official sakoku (closed-country) policy had been in place since the early 17th century, when Christian missionaries, active in the country for 100 years, began to seem to the ruling shoguns like an advance guard for European imperialists. Up went the drawbridge. Japan became an impregnable fortress — or a black hole, strictly off-limits to all but a handful of Dutch and Chinese traders confined to specific parts of Nagasaki. “Let us trade, too!” pleaded a party of 61 China-based Portuguese envoys who landed in Nagasaki in 1640. Their arrest and summary beheading was the shogun’s crisp, clear response. It got the point across. Traders, whalers, diplomats, explorers all kept their distance — for a time. The first to come cautiously knocking, a century and a half later, were Russians. They had been quietly settling parts of Ezo (present-day Hokkaido), then largely unclaimed, and in 1791 a Russian naval officer appeared in Matsumae, Ezo, with a letter from the czar, Catherine the Great. Politely rebuffed, he left peaceably, his letter undelivered. But he too got a point across, to those with eyes to see it: Japan’s seclusion was wearing thin. The following years saw numerous intrusions, courteous or truculent, by British, American, French and Russian ships. Some demanded supplies, others wanted to trade; one or two carried Japanese castaways for repatriation. The world was shrinking; here it was at Japan’s gates, and what was Japan going to do about it? The harshest prod of all was the Opium War (1839-42), in which Britain wrested Hong Kong and various trading privileges (notably the right to deal in opium) from a decadent China. Would this be Japan’s fate as well? In 1844, King Willem II of Holland sent Shogun Tokugawa Ieyoshi a friendly warning: “The intercourse between the different nations of the Earth is increasing with great rapidity. An irresistible power is drawing them together. Through the invention of steamships distances have become shorter. A nation preferring to remain in isolation at this time of increasing relationships could not avoid hostility with many others.” The next act in the drama is well known: U.S. Navy Commodore Matthew Perry; the “Black Ships”; the “opening of Japan.” That was in 1854. Japan under duress signed a series of “unequal treaties” (1854-58), first with the United States, then with Britain, Holland, Russia and France. Japanese ports, long closed, were opened to international commerce. Foreign nationals were granted rights of residence. Foreign consuls arrived. Tariffs were set low, to Japan’s disadvantage, Japan powerless to raise them. Foreigners were subject not to Japanese law but to the laws of their home countries. This was “extra-territoriality,” the most galling insult of all. Japan’s is a martial culture. A government submitting to terms like these had better watch its back. Long before Perry, the shogunate faced internal challenges. Broadly speaking they were of two kinds — progressive and conservative, as we would say today. The progressives knew something of Western science, medicine and government and saw in them Japan’s only hope against “barbarian” powers that preyed on the powerless. To conservatives, this was to accept barbarization. Japan would triumph not by brute power but by innate spirit. But what spirit — Confucian, or Shinto? Confucianists looked to ancient Chinese sages as the source of the moral Way. Nativists turned to their own country’s past. Why look further? Was Japan not “the land of the gods”? A sense of partaking in divinity is the most uncompromising of incentives. It bred in Japan a group of mostly low-ranking samurai known as shishi (men of spirit). Their zeal knew no bounds. They would put their swords at the service of the Emperor, descendant of the Sun Goddess, and rid their divine land of the barbarians. “Sonnō jōi!” For centuries the emperors had been mere ciphers, languishing in poverty and impotence in Kyoto, the ancient capital, while the shoguns ruled in Edo (present-day Tokyo), the seat of power since 1603. Emperor Komei (reigned 1846-67) began as a puppet like his predecessors — but turned at last on the puppeteers. The opening of the ports, “be it but for a day or even half a day,” was intolerable, he wrote in a personal memorandum to the shogunate in 1859. The shishi rallied round him, their spirits burnished by an 1825 text by nativist thinker Aizawa Seishin (1782-1863): “Our Divine Realm is where the sun emerges. It is the source of the primordial vital force, sustaining all life and order. … Our Divine Realm rightly constitutes the head and shoulders of the world and controls all nations.” To the shishi he inspired, temporizers were traitors. Ii Naosuke, the shogunal minister who had signed the treaties, was cut down. Many other assassinations were plotted and a few were carried out. Chaos reigned — madness too, if a beheading in 1863 in a Kyoto temple deserves the name. The victims were three wooden statues of 14th-century shoguns deemed to have been disloyal to their emperors. The heads were displayed on the banks of the Kamo River — a warning to traitors that patriots knew how to deal with them. Five years later the Meiji Restoration overthrew the tottering shogunate and launched Japan on the most intense modernizing and industrializing drive the world had ever seen. Many of its leaders were shishi. “Sonnō jōi”? Make that … “Bunmei kaika” — “civilization and enlightenment.” It was a Meiji maxim that meant, in effect, “Westernization.” Those who damned it as barbarization were by this time quite helpless to stem the tide.",

    "source": "Parolee in 1963 Saitama girl's slaying hits authorities for lying, forcing confessions <eos> Investigators will lie, grill for hours on end and withhold exonerating evidence — in effect do anything — to extract a confession from a suspect they have pegged for a crime, a 1994 parolee seeking a retrial to clear his name in the 1963 kidnap-murder of a Saitama Prefecture girl said Thursday in Tokyo. Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan, Kazuo Ishikawa, who appeared with his lawyer, Taketoshi Nakayama, pointed to discrepancies in the kanji used in an apparent ransom demand for ¥200,000 and an earlier document he wrote and also alleged that the state looked to him as a usual suspect because of his roots in Japan’s former outcast class known as the “burakumin.” He continues to claim he is innocent. Ishikawa was arrested in 1963 for the kidnap-slaying of Yoshie Nakata in the town of Sayama. An autopsy carried out on her corpse at the time concluded she had been raped and strangled. In a notorious case that would become known as the “Sayama Incident,” Ishikawa was initially sentenced to hang. He claimed he was threatened and tricked by prosecutors into making a false confession, which he later retracted in seeking to appeal his sentence. “I was told by the police that my older brother was actually their prime suspect, and that they were planning to arrest him. But then they said that if I agreed to be his scapegoat, they would let me off the hook after just 10 years,” Ishikawa, 74, said, explaining why he decided to plead guilty during his first trial in 1964. But after being sentenced to death, he filed an appeal, professing his innocence and arguing the police had forced his confession. In 1974, the Tokyo High Court commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment. Dissatisfied, Ishikawa appealed to the Supreme Court but lost, and his sentence was finalized in 1977. Paroled in 1994, Ishikawa, who still must see a probation officer, called for abolishment of the “daiyo kangoku” substitute detention cells inside police stations that were originally set up in 1908 amid a shortage of prisons. The system is often denounced both in Japan and abroad because it effectively allows police to keep suspects under constant monitoring without access to lawyers. “When the clock hit about 5 p.m., the police would take away my wristwatch and just continue their interrogation until midnight. I had no way of knowing how long they had grilled me,” Ishikawa said. After Nakata disappeared and before she was slain, her family received a written ransom demand that remains the only possible clue to identify the killer. The carefully crafted letter, with bizarre kanji that some suspect was an attempt to suggest the writer was barely literate, has been used by prosecutors as the main evidence to implicate Ishikawa, whose handwriting they have claimed resembled that found in the note. Ishikawa, born into an impoverished “buraku” social outcast community, claims he never could have penned such a skilled letter, citing his near illiteracy at the time of the killing. His lawyer, Nakayama, questioned the legitimacy of the handwriting analyses by the police, pointing out they deliberately ignored obvious discrepancies that might work in Ishikawa’s favor. It was only after 47 years since Ishikawa’s arrest that prosecutors finally disclosed a petition letter he wrote that suggests his writing style differed from that of the ransom note. “How could they have kept such important evidence under wraps for 47 years?” Nakayama asked. Criticizing the prolonged unwillingness by prosecutors to make key evidence public, Nakayama claimed the police arrested Ishikawa because of his low social status. “The police basically took advantage of the deep-rooted prejudice against the outcast class to wrongfully proclaim Ishikawa a murderer. We’re now making our utmost effort to reopen his case” and clear his name, Nakayama said.",

The financial watchdog first ordered the bank in September to improve operations, saying it did not take “substantial steps” to prevent or break off transactions with “antisocial forces” for more than two years despite knowing about the matter. This time, the FSA is considering issuing the business improvement order to its parent Mizuho Financial Group Inc. as well, since the holding company failed to fulfill its responsibility to oversee the bank, the sources said. The Mizuho group will thus need to improve its management system again. After receiving the order, Mizuho Bank initially said top management was not informed of the gangster loans but later reversed itself, with President Yasuhiro Sato telling a press conference that he and former President Satoru Nishibori “were in positions to know” about the issue.

On top of the weakening yen and recovery from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, tourist numbers were helped by easier visa regulations for Southeast Asian countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, as well as the increase in budget airlines serving Japan. “It’s been 10 years since we launched the Visit Japan campaign and attracting 10 million visitors has been our genuine wish” and we have finally achieved the goal, transport minister Akihiro Ota said during a ceremony at Narita International Airport. A couple from Thailand, Praphan Pha Tra Prasit and Yu Pha Da Pha Tra Prasit, were chosen as the collective 10 millionth memorial visitors and joined the ceremony. They received goods including a plaque and lamps decorated with Japanese papers. Although a time frame has not been set, the government is now aiming to double its goal to 20 million, with a long-term goal of drawing in 30 million tourists by 2030. The goal of 10 million visitors in one year was first set in 2010, but only 8.61 million tourists showed up. While the figure may have fallen short of the goal, it was still a record that stood until this year. There was a serious decline in 2011 due to the Tohoku natural disasters and Fukushima nuclear crisis. The figure recovered last year before finally reaching the 10 million goal in 2013. According to data from the Japan National Tourism Organization, visitors from pretty much all countries increased except for China. The relaxed visa regulations paid off with tourists from most ASEAN members increasing. Between January and November, visitors from Vietnam increased 53.5 percent over the same period last year, while the figure was 36 percent for Indonesia and 69 percent for Thailand. While the government may have reached its 10 million goal, the number is not all that impressive when measuring countries and regions with strong tourism. For instance, 27 countries in 2012 drew more than 10 million visitors. France was No. 1 with 83 million while China drew 57.7 million and South Korea 11.1 million.",

    "source": "No-frills Beijing bun shop stunned as Chinese president drops by unannounced <eos> BEIJING - Chinese President Xi Jinping dropped in Saturday at a traditional Beijing bun shop, where he waited in line, ordered and paid for a simple lunch of buns stuffed with pork and onions, green vegetables, and stewed pig livers and intestines. Such visits are extremely rare — if not unheard of — for top Chinese leaders, who are usually surrounded by heavy security and are not known for mingling with the public other than at scheduled events. After spotting Xi, fellow diners took photos of him and shared them on China’s social media. State media re-posted the photos on their microblog accounts, and the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Xi’s lunch through its Chinese-language news site. The manager of the Qing-Feng Steamed Dumpling Shop, who gave only her family name, He, when reached by phone said Xi and a small entourage arrived at the no-frills eatery in western Beijing at around noon without prior notification. She said Xi paid 21 yuan ($3.40) for his lunch. “There was no special security measure during his stay,” the manager said. “Customers could freely enter and leave the restaurant, and many took photos with him.” In one shot, a chef posed with Xi as he continued eating his meal in front of the camera. Installed as China’s president in March, Xi has sought to portray himself as being in touch with regular people, but has done so with scheduled visits to factories and homes. In April, a Hong Kong newspaper reported that Xi had taken a cab ride in Beijing — also highly unusual for a top leader — but the excitement soon dissipated when state media denied the report. Though a socialist country in name, China has a deep-rooted hierarchy system that accords privileges to one’s official ranking. In recent years, members of the Chinese public have applauded Western leaders for their regular person style to vent their disapproval of Chinese officials’ aloofness. Some commentators have noted that Xi’s team has been savvy in building his image. Others waxed lyrical over his bun shop stop. “Had it not been for the photos, it would be incredulous to believe Xi, as a dignified president and party chief, should eat at a bun shop,” author Wu Xiqi wrote in an editorial carried by the ruling Communist Party’s official news site. “Xi’s act has subverted the traditional image of Chinese officials, ushering a warm, people-first gust of wind that is very touching indeed.”",

    "source": "It's business as usual 'back in the USSR' <eos> Paul McCartney was in Japan some weeks ago. Having spent a totally Beatlemaniac four years of my pre-teen existence in the U.K., it was nice to see the erstwhile Beatle in such good form. The occasion also reminded me of the song “Back in the USSR,” a 1968 Beatles number. My fellow Beatles lovers will be very familiar with the lyrics of that piece. Just the same, let me remind you how part of it goes: “Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out. They leave the West behind. “And Moscow girls make me sing and shout. That Georgia’s always on my mind.” Here is some history for you. It is worthwhile remembering that both Ukraine and Georgia were a part of the USSR at that point. No prizes for remembering what USSR stands for, although I fear there could now be a generation of readers that must resort to the Internet to discover the answer. Both Ukraine and Georgia are independent states now. Yet it seems that given half the chance, Russian President Vladimir Putin would like to see them both pulled back into Russia’s sphere of influence. The recent turn of events in Kiev indicates Ukraine girls still need to be careful of how they tread. Putin would surely be happy to see them “leave the West behind” and rejoin him behind what is, for now, the invisible iron curtain. That would literally be a “Back in the USSR” moment for him. But there are things one hopes will never happen again in the history of any country. There are things one believes will never come back to haunt us. Nightmarish history should not, and will not, repeat itself — that is what you hope and believe, whether you are a Ukrainian girl or a Japanese citizen who lived through World War II times. Yet the hopes of both look a little bit threatened at this point. For the first time in a very long time, protesters came out in force to campaign against the recent enactment of the state secrets law in Japan. Many of them must surely be sharing the sentiments of the protesters in Kiev: This is not happening. This should not be happening. We should not need to be protesting against such things in this day and age. Never would we have thought such worries would trouble us again. Worries over freedom. Worries over threats to human rights. Worries about a state that ignores the rights and wishes of the people that it is supposed to be serving. The Beatles were never a very socio-politically conscious group. Yet the piece “Back in the USSR” is so full of interesting suggestions that one wonders where the inspiration for it all came from. Could Paul have been taking a trip across time as he set those words to music? Of course the most suggestive bit is the refrain. As we all know, it talks about “Back in the U.S. Back in the U.S. Back in the USSR.” If the U.S. is the USSR, and the USSR is the U.S., nobody needs to worry about either the fate of the Ukrainian girls or which Georgia we happen to have on our minds at any given point in time. If only the same kind of togetherness could be achieved by Japan and its neighbors, with whom our relationship seems so strained at this point. If Paul could come up with the kind of lyrics that glue us together a la “Back in the USSR,” he would be doing us all a great service. Merry and matey does it in this season of good will.

    "source": "Who is responsible for a corporate scandal? <eos> Recent scandals involving Japanese businesses have included bank loans to the underworld and misrepresentations of restaurant menus at leading hotels, and many of the media reports have focused on how management takes responsibility for the mess. I would like to highlight three points that need to be taken into account when discussing such issues: First, circumstances change with the passage of time. In these fast-changing economic times, corporations that were once considered top-tier can be forced into bankruptcy. Regarding bank loans to problematic borrowers, it is possible for borrowers to meet all requisite conditions when the loans were initially granted but then find themselves in a different situation over time. In such cases, corporations must be in a position to respond appropriately, which effectively means having established in-house oversight mechanisms already in place. In the case of Mizuho Bank, this mechanism appears to have been corrupted as a result of management problems typical of a bank that’s been created through the merger of multiple financial institutions, where the management structure tends to be vertically laid out along the divisional lines of each original bank. Secondly, who bears responsibility? Regarding loans to the yakuza, the party involved is a corporation — a legal entity as defined by law. Although some responsibility obviously lies with the people at the bank who actually dealt with the loans, it becomes a subject of debate as to who takes the blame for the fiasco as a business entity. In other words, the question is who should take responsibility for an act by a corporation that regularly rotates its management over time? I recall an experience I once had with a Swiss unit of a company I worked for that is related to the bank loan scandal. When approving annual earnings figures and electing members to sit on the board for the next fiscal year in Switzerland, a resolution is adopted that prevents former board members from being liable for anything that happens at the company at any time after they step down. Under the country’s banking laws, a majority of board members need to be Swiss nationals. I initially suspected that this was a measure of self-protection by the local board members. However, the purpose of such a resolution is to confirm that all responsibilities are formally passed on to the succeeding members of the board. As a result, subsequent board members cannot evade responsibility for an illegitimate loan with an excuse that he was not with the board or the bank when the loan was granted. If they do not agree to such a resolution, they have a choice to step down as a board member. Unless this principle is protected, a situation could emerge where nobody at the bank takes responsibility for problems in a long-term loan approved by their predecessors who have already retired. When this principle is applied to Mizuho’s yakuza loans, it’s obvious that the responsibility lies with the current members of the board. The question then becomes, who takes the blame for each specific aspect of the problem? Thirdly, acts of falsification — namely, the menu misrepresentations — can be carried out by corporations and individual businesses. Operators of those restaurants may have had a hard time making money as the cost of ingredients rose with the yen’s depreciation, but that’s no excuse for their actions. In any case, that’s precisely what happens in a competitive market. Market mechanisms can occasionally go too far, but socialism through artificial policy manipulation has historically shown itself to be a failure. In corporate organizations or individual businesses, responsibility falls on the people who actually drive the day-to-day transactions. The basic principles of commerce are tied to the level of trust that is ultimately formed with your customers, and this relationship of trust is maintained by the people in charge. As economies around the world become increasingly integrated, such acts as menu falsifications represent a betrayal of trust for consumers. We should remember that such actions are not just something individuals or corporations need to be aware of — they can also damage the international credibility of Japan as a whole.

In a survey earlier this year by global travel information website TripAdvisor, Harajuku was voted the most popular tourist destination in the country. The street has become famous for its large number of shops and boutiques targeting youths, especially high school girls, with fashion items having unique — even peculiar — tastes. Since Takeshita-dori has been designated by Shibuya Ward as an adult entertainment-free district, there are no pachinko parlors or “fuzoku” sex shops nearby. That is one of the reasons why schools from across the country choose the area as a major destination during their traditional trips to Tokyo. The number of visitors peaks during spring break in March and Golden Week in late April and early May. According to data compiled by JR and Tokyo subway companies, an average of around 110,000 people visit the area every day. After World War II, the Washington Heights housing facility for high-ranking U.S. servicemen was built in what is now Yoyogi Park. Not long after, shops selling furniture and toys to the U.S. residents began to spring up around Harajuku. Local merchants say the current shape of Takeshita-dori based on youth fashion was formed in 1974, when a nine-story commercial complex called Palais France was built at the end of the street near Meiji-dori. The complex was demolished about a decade ago. Kazuhiro Osozawa, head of the Takeshita-dori merchants association, said he hopes the shops in the area will make young people’s dreams come true.",

    "source": "Crusader for social activism brings Change.org to Japan <eos> It was a victorious moment for Emmy Suzuki Harris when the Matsue Board of Education in Shimane Prefecture retracted its request to limit students’ access to the manga “Hadashi no Gen” (“Barefoot Gen”). The retraction last summer was partly because the ban had gone viral and triggered a controversy after more than 20,000 signatures were collected online against the restriction via Change.org . Suzuki Harris had launched the Japanese edition of the global petition platform in August 2012 . “We had significant victories where people felt like they are part of something that happened,” said Suzuki Harris. “People see something in the news and think, ‘Actually I have an opinion about that,’ and join the petition to make their voices heard.” Suzuki Harris has become a crusader for social change in Japan, where few people are used to wading into social or political activism. The 29-year-old advocate hopes Change.org will offer a place for Japanese to get involved in the democratic process by making their voices heard, as the world’s biggest online petition platform allows anybody to take matters into their own hands at any time without the worry of running up big bills. Since its launch in Japan, more than 150,000 people have either started or participated in petitions. This fast growth rate came as a happy surprise to Suzuki Harris, as she was often told this kind of platform wouldn’t work in Japanese society, where most people shy away from being the first one to take action and are afraid of the ramifications it they raise a voice regarding social or political issues. “You have to give people concrete and real examples of things that are working when you use online tools to impact the real world,” said Suzuki Harris. Petitions at Change.org range from the highly political, such as a call to abolish the controversial state secrecy bill or to press Okinawa Gov. Hirokazu Nakaima not to authorize a landfill operation to build a relocation facility for the U.S. Futenma military base, to very local issues, such as not to do away with a bicycle lane in a neighborhood park. Several petitions have found success, such as a student drive for universities to reduce their fees when they take a leave of absence, while others have failed to produce positive results. “If you talk to petition starters, even if they did not win, they say ‘I am really glad that I did that. It was a really good experience for me,’ ” said Suzuki Harris. “You feel like they have a little bit more confidence and they have a little bit more experience under their belt.” Even though she is now a prominent activist in Japan, Suzuki Harris did not always have a strong bent toward social movements. Born into what she describes as a business-oriented family — an American father and Japanese mother here in Japan — she said she never really followed the news or took an interest in social issues. After graduating from Yale University, she worked for McKinsey & Co., an American-based global consulting company. Her turning point came in 2008 when she heard Barack Obama giving a campaign speech at a warehouse in downtown Seattle when he was running for president. Suzuki Harris said it was the first time that she had listened to a politician speaking and it really felt like he was speaking to her personally, as an individual. “That was the first time I’d ever taken an interest in politics and thought about the importance of the election or contributing to the society in a way more than to have a job and pay taxes,” said Suzuki Harris, who left McKinsey and moved to New York, where she joined Obama’s grass-roots campaign team. While Obama influenced U.S. voters with his campaign slogan of “change” in 2008, which helped him sweep to victory, his philosophy of bringing social change via the power of the Internet inspired Suzuki Harris to get involved in social change campaigns and ultimately help launch Change.org in Japan. This is why she is somewhat disappointed with the way the Japanese media and politicians treated the power of the Internet during the Upper House election in July, when online campaigning was partly deregulated. Suzuki Harris felt that even tech-savvy politicians talked about the Internet in the context of Facebook or Twitter to solicit votes when in reality the Internet could be a powerful platform for constructive policy discussion. Many politicians lost interest in online activities as soon as the election was over, she said, while in contrast Obama kept the communication channels open following his first victory in 2008. “Obama was able to reactivate people, because during those four years he spent money, time and effort in maintaining those communities,” said Suzuki Harris. “I think we are not going to see payoffs of that kind of community organizing done online in Japan for a little bit longer because people need to build the community, maintain it and make it OK for the people to express political will online, but I don’t think the people were there yet this past summer.” Suzuki Harris acknowledges that change takes time, as was demonstrated in the civil rights movement in the United States in the 1960s and recent victories by the LGBT community over same-sex marriage after many years of struggle. But she said it is now time for the Japanese people to realize that the government can no longer provide what they want when resources are limited, and that the public should not let big government organizations or companies keep control of the decision-making process. She said petitions are the easiest way for people to start taking ownership in their local community. “I think the marketplace for ideas here is limited to folks who already have a standing or who are quote-unquote not afraid of opinion,” she said. “My goal is to help more people believe that their voice matters and that their opinion is worth something, because I think too many Japanese people think their opinion is worthless.” Highlights for Emmy Suzuki Harris 1983 — Born in Tokyo. 2006 — Graduates from Yale University. 2006 — Joins McKinsey & Co. as a business analyst. 2008 — Leaves McKinsey and joins Obama for America as new media deputy. 2009 — Goes to work for the New York State Senate as an online communications manager. 2009 — Joins Purpose, a social movement startup, as a senior strategist. 2012 — Moves back to Japan and launches Change.org .",

    "source": "No country for small-time rice farmers <eos> ABIKO, CHIBA PREF., Ogata Akita Pref. - In the suburbs of Tokyo, rice farmer Koichi Yuge is weighing how the government’s change of heart on controlling rice prices will impact his 300-year-old family business. Yuge, who grows the Koshihikari brand of rice on 6 hectares of paddies in the city of Abiko, Chiba Prefecture, said he’s worried that the government’s recent decision to scrap traditional controls on rice production could cause supplies to surge amid slipping demand, lowering prices even further. The 48-year-old Yuge is a typical rice grower in Japan: a small-scale, part-time farmer who often finds himself at the whim of changes in government policy. “I don’t make money from farming, especially from rice,” Yuge, who lives with his wife, two school-age children and elderly parents, said. “I make a living from managing rental properties I own, and use that income to supplement my losses in farming.” Yuge said the reason he maintains his loss-incurring farming business is because he feels indebted to his forebears, who passed the land down through the centuries. “It also provides a reason to live for my parents, who like tending the paddies,” he added. For most Japanese farmers, rice farming is not nearly sufficient to earn a living. According to the agriculture ministry, the average arable land per farmer was only 1.8 hectares in 2006, compared with 16.9 hectares in Europe, 180.2 hectares in the United States and a staggering 3,424 hectares in Australia. Among Japan’s 1.2 million rice farming families in 2010, full-time cultivators accounted for only 18.7 percent, while the remainder, such as Yuge, farm part time while holding a second job. Yuge said things were rosier in the old days, when government-controlled rice prices kept going up every year. He pointed to a towel that he proudly hangs on the wall of a farmhouse behind his spacious residence, listing the year-by-year figure for the wholesale price of 60 kg of rice. The list goes all the way back to 1868. It shows that the price of rice grew steadily over the years, peaking in 1984 and plateauing for a few years afterward. By the time he inherited the family business in 1989, after graduating from college, prices had started falling despite the government-set “gentan” production quota, which reduces rice production by controlling farmland in use. The trend continues to this day, with domestic rice consumption waning as lifestyles become more Westernized. “When my dad was in charge, it was a great time for rice farmers,” said Yuge, who also grows corn, carrots and leeks. “If the price falls further, whether through a relaxation of government restrictions on rice production or through Japan’s participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, I won’t have enough money to replace my old farming equipment.” Despite his emotional attachment to farming, he said he doesn’t want his children to inherit the family tradition: “I tell my son to become a salaryman. It’s too tough to be a farmer.” For Hajime Kobayashi, chairman of the agricultural cooperative of Ogata, Akita Prefecture, the political landscape looks a bit different. His village was developed by the central government with land reclaimed from Japan’s second-largest lake, Hachirogata, and it is one of the few places left in the country with large-scale paddies. Ogata has 510 full-time farming families, and 80 percent of them have young successors ready to continue the family business. The average farmer has 17.2 hectares of paddies. “This is a place where you need to bet your future on rice production,” Kobayashi said. According to Kobayashi, agricultural cooperatives in other areas have maintained strong ties with ruling party politicians, meaning they could rely on the government to keep rice prices high and provide various subsidies to rice farmers. But he argues the state pricing system should now be scrapped to force rice farmers to compete. That would benefit consumers and at the same time create new sales opportunities at home and overseas, and for processed food products made with rice flour, Kobayashi said. But lowering prices means less income for farmers, particularly those who work full time, he said, so the government should provide direct subsidies to them to mitigate those losses and stabilize their income. Toru Wakui, another large-scale farmer in Ogata, largely agreed with Kobayashi. Government financial supports for rice farmers, if any, should be based on a national consensus that Japan needs to maintain its agriculture sector to be prepared for potential global food shortages — not on the vested interests of farmers and politicians, Wakui said. “If the people agree that Japan doesn’t need (domestic) rice, you should just get rid of agriculture,” he said. “But if the people believe Japan needs agriculture, something like direct payment to farmers or a high rice price may be needed. It should be a decision by the people.”",

    "source": "State secrets bill shows Abe's tin ear for local politics <eos> Former U.S. Speaker of the House Thomas “Tip” O’Neill, one of America’s most influential politicians of the late 20th century, had some sage advice for those who thought about national or international politics. “All politics,” O’Neill warned, “is local.” It’s a lesson Tokyo’s political and media class too often forgets or ignores. In the case of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the negative reaction around Japan to his forcing the state secrets bill through the Diet just adds to the perception he has a tin ear for local politics. Had Abe or his Cabinet listened more and spoken less, they would have discovered the law was not just a “national” issue. From Osaka and Kobe to Fukushima, Fukui and Okinawa, local leaders were skeptical at best and have concerns that are not going to go away. In Osaka, Mayor and Nippon Ishin no Kai (Japan Restoration Party) co-leader Toru Hashimoto, of all people, rose to defend freedom of the press and open government from the old, mostly Tokyo-based, nationalist right-wingers in his party who welcomed the law as a way to return the country to the 1930s of their dreams. Hashimoto’s opposition was not political grandstanding. Like many Osakans, he saw the secrecy law as an ill-considered attempt by Tokyo control freaks to roll back government transparency and, Hashimoto believes, government efficiency. In neighboring Kobe, there was a different concern. Since the mid-1970s, the city has required foreign military vessels entering the harbor to declare whether or not they have nuclear weapons. The regulation was aimed at U.S. warships, and none have visited Kobe since the ordinance was passed. But Kobe citizens and local politicians now worry their city will be found guilty of violating the law’s provisions on defense if it continues to enforce the ordinance. In Fukui and Fukushima, the worry is what happens to information about nuclear power plants, rather than technical data. Shimin Ombudsman, a national confederation of government watchdogs, publishes information about the cozy financial relationship between nuclear power and local governments. And all local governments seek more information about the plants to facilitate better cooperation between their operators and local police, fire and emergency rescue teams. Could such information be at least partially classified by paranoid bureaucrats or politicians under the law’s opaque goal of “preventing terrorism”? The Fukushima Prefectural Assembly formally questioned the law, while Fukui Prefecture said it’s not applicable to nuclear power stations. This echoes Tokyo’s assurances. But it’s also a political warning to Abe that Fukui, which hosts 13 commercial atomic power plants, is not going to simply salute and say, “yes sir,” and walk away if told by the central government that whatever nuclear plant-related information it seeks has been classified. And then there’s Okinawa. Some proponents of U.S. military installations might welcome the law as a great way to shut up — and shut out — the anti-base movement’s constant demands for information. But this would be a mistake. Okinawan politicians, especially those in the local Liberal Democratic Party chapter who support the bases, also understand that actions by Tokyo resulting in less, not more, transparency about the bases is only going to create more political headaches for them. In addition, over the past couple of years Okinawa’s anti-base movement has changed tactics. It’s reached out to allies in Washington, with whom it regularly consults for information on what the U.S. government is doing. Just because Tokyo has classified something about Okinawa doesn’t mean it will remain a secret because Okinawans have more of an ability to seek out the same information in the United States, where the information may be publicly available. Whether due to hubris or a genuine belief he can ride out any opposition, Abe believes he’s weathered the storm and that, whatever political price he and his ruling LDP eventually pay for the secrets law, it will be small. He will no doubt continue to assert that the law is a national issue that has no effect on local government. However, as last week’s breakup of the opposition group Your Party showed, and as O’Neill would have known, even if it really is about local government none of the time, it’s about local politics, i.e. the attitude of your voters, all of the time.",

    "source": "Why didn't Japan have a revolution like France's? <eos> Why wasn’t there a revolution in Japan like the one in France? The suffering was as great in 18th-century Japan as in the realm of ill-fated King Louis XVI, the government here as callous and incompetent as the government there. How did Japan’s old order — rotting internally, as its collapse under foreign threat in the 1860s proved — escape being overthrown by the starving and enraged masses? Rage smoldered perpetually and erupted frequently. By one count there were 2,967 peasant ikki (uprisings) during the Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1867); by another, 6,889. It depends on what degree of violence qualifies as an ikki. The worst of them were very violent indeed, so much so that a mere threat was sometimes enough to make a prudent daimyo (feudal lord) back down. He would have in mind, perhaps, the Shimabara peasant revolt in 1638 in Kyushu’s present-day Nagasaki Prefecture — a victory for the shogunal forces that crushed it, though at the cost of 15,000 casualties. The living conditions in Shimabara were especially harsh. Tax was piled on tax — door tax, shelf tax, hearth tax, cattle tax, birth tax, death tax — all this in addition to the basic tax on produce. Taxes were paid in rice and other grains, so that payment often meant starvation. Punishment for nonpayment had to be worse in order to be effective. Various lesser tortures culminated in the “ mino dance,” mino being the name of the straw raincoat in which offenders were burned alive as an example to others. Cruelty this grotesque is rare in the annals. Oppression beyond a certain point hinders production. Peasant toil requires a degree of health and strength. If not human sympathy, simple self-interest inclined most daimyo to a measure of lenience. Only a measure, however. The nativist philosopher Motoori Norinaga (1730-1801) expressed the prevailing attitude, warning in 1771, “If the people below do not fear those above, this is the root of disorder.” Had Motoori and other mainstream Japanese thinkers of the day ever even heard of France? China and India are the only foreign countries they mention. France would have rewarded scrutiny, however. “Disorder” there was acquiring a new meaning, soon to be encapsulated in a new political term: revolution. It means many things and arouses many emotions, from dread to exultation, but it boils down to this blunt observation by one of its early philosophers, Louis de Saint-Just (1764-94): “The wretched are the power of the Earth.” The Confucian theory then prevailing in Japan accorded peasants high honor. They ranked second in the class hierarchy, below the samurai but above artisans and merchants. So much for theory. Practice is summed up by two proverbs of the day: “The peasants are a tool for the extraction of rice tax,” and “Peasants are like sesame seeds. The harder you squeeze them the more they give.” That conveys their wretchedness. What about their power? They had it and often wielded it, frequently suffering torture and execution, sometimes carrying their point. The earliest ikki date back to the 15th century. In 1441, Kyoto, the Imperial capital, was besieged by peasants demanding nullification of crushing debt. “Now (the peasants) have blocked the seven gateways into the capital,” a government minister confided to his diary. “There is nothing on sale anymore, and the capital is doomed to starve. An unspeakable state of affairs!” Unspeakable but irresistible. “This was the first time in the history of Japan,” notes historian Donald Keene (in “Yoshimasa and the Silver Pavilion,” 2003), “that the government had bowed in this manner to demands of the common people.” The first time; not the last. In December 1707 Mount Fuji erupted, burying nearby villages in 4 meters of volcanic ash. Homes were lost, harvests destroyed, spring planting jeopardized. When officials of the Odawara domain (in present-day Kanagawa Prefecture) were slow to respond to appeals for relief, the desperate farmers hastily organized a march to Edo (present-day Tokyo). Cornered, the daimyo backed down. The last thing he wanted was thousands of his peasants swarming the metropolis and showing the world the breakdown of his local rule. Famine was the curse of preindustrial Japan, as of preindustrial France. No region in Japan suffered more down the centuries than Tohoku, the northeastern region of Honshu, and no part of Tohoku was harder hit than the Nanbu domain, desperately poor at the best of times, centered on Morioka. Begrudging nature and corrupt government share the blame. Here in 1853 there occurred one of the greatest peasant revolts in Japanese history. Some 17,000 farmers massed, marched, smashed property of the rich, crossed the border into the rival Sendai domain and submitted a list of grievances to the Sendai daimyo. The shogun in Edo took notice — and the shogunate took action. The Nanbu daimyo was dispossessed. The peasants were victorious. But not revolutionary. Why not? Where is the line that must be crossed before the aroused fury of the downtrodden masses produces not just destruction, fear and concessions but a true revolution? The best answer is a philosophical one. A revolution alters our deepest thoughts. It makes former ways of thinking almost unthinkable. In 1789, France’s revolutionary National Assembly produced a Declaration of the Rights of Man which proclaimed, “All men are born free and equal.” That’s France’s revolution in a nutshell. Nothing comparable came out of Japan’s peasant violence. Japan’s peasants, even the most progressive among them, never dreamed such a thing. All they demanded was relief from starvation. Sometimes they got it. More often they didn’t. Either way, the feudal system that oppressed and exploited them went practically unchallenged, and when it finally crumbled, a mere 14 years after the Nanbu revolt, the fatal blow was struck by foreign interlopers, not Japanese revolutionaries.",

But that’s not to say they are avoiding the city. Indeed, the opposite is true, especially for those traveling here from other countries in the region. Recent statistics released by the Osaka Government Tourism Bureau show that in 2012, about 8.36 million people visited Japan, with 5.42 million, or 65 percent, coming from four Asian countries and cities: South Korea, Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong. Of these, around 52 percent from Taiwan, 50 percent from Hong Kong, 30 percent from South Korea and 20 percent from China passed through Kansai airport, as opposed to only 11 percent of those from North America. This year, foreign visitors to Osaka are expected to hit about 2.6 million, up from 2.1 million in 2012. Past attempts to sell Osaka abroad have focused on bringing people to aquariums or landmarks that city planners mistakenly thought would be of interest. Now, however, the focus is on marketing Osaka as an entertainment destination and providing a more personal, interactive experience. Among the promotional activities planned for 2014 are the Osaka Pop International Cool Japan Awards, scheduled to take place in March, and the UNESCO-sponsored International Jazz Day, which is actually five days of concerts and workshops that kick off on April 25. The pop festival in late March includes events on manga, anime, food, music and other cultural curiosities. The awards will honor the most creative entries from around the world in a variety of pop culture fields and will become an annual event. On the other hand, promoting jazz in Osaka sounds strange to Kansai-area residents, who have long associated that particular genre of music with its western neighbor Kobe, the venue for one of the nation’s largest jazz festivals for over 30 years. But Osaka tourism bureau Executive Director Kunio Kano says efforts are bearing fruit. “In November, we hosted the first Osaka Asian Dream Jazz Competition. Thelonious Monk Jr. attended, and we had support from the Monk Institute of Jazz. With the International Jazz Day planned for April, we think Osaka will become a major Asian hub for jazz,” he said. Osaka officials have also, finally, begun to offer themed walking tours. Six tours are offered on the bureau’s website, covering the city’s northern and southern areas and focusing on Osaka Castle, Sumiyoshi Shrine, the city’s various waterways, the throbbing Dotonbori district and the more down-to-earth (traditionally, at least) Tennoji district. Residents have long been proud of their food and boast about the “takoyaki” (octopus dumplings) and okonomiyaki (as-you-like pancakes) as reasons to visit. However, Kyoto, Sapporo, Yokohama, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Okinawa and, of course, Tokyo, have restaurants of all kinds offering food that is similar in quality or better than what one can find in Osaka. The response to such regional competition has been to boost emphasis on the creation and enjoyment of simple foods via tours to local markets, highlight the part of town that sells kitchen and restaurant supplies, and offer home cooking experiences where tourists can learn to make dishes like sushi, okonomiyaki, and tempura. This overall strategy might be working, given the rise in visitors. But Osaka’s goal is to attract 4.5 million of them by 2016, and 6.5 million by 2020 — ambitious figures, to be sure. Additional flights from Asian cities into Kansai airport these past few years, plus the fact that more tour companies are bringing visitors in through Tokyo and out through Kansai, will help meet these targets. Additionally, if Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government legalizes casino resorts next year, those who with a yen for gambling will also have a reason to come. At the same time, private entrepreneurs are targeting the kind of visitor officials and big travel agencies tend to ignore: intelligent and curious individuals who hate guided bus tours and prefer to take things at their own pace. Osaka resident Sam Crofts conducts bicycle tours of Osaka through his company Cycle Osaka. Limited to six people, he takes visitors on a leisurely journey through the city, where they see the sites and stop occasionally for snacks, drinks, pictures and chit-chat. Many of those who sign up, Crofts says, are from Asia. “I get the impression that (my customers) want to see something real, not the old world perfection of Kyoto or the endless glass of Tokyo. They love the Osaka Castle grounds, and most are surprised by the amount of greenery, though my route is careful to exploit every square inch of it. They also like Nakanoshima’s European-style buildings and when random people stop and say hi, which happens all the time on our tours but much less outside of Osaka, apparently,” Crofts said. “On the less positive side, I get a lot of questions about homeless people. Many say it’s the only time in Japan they have seen people sleeping on the floor in the middle of town,” he added. His advice for luring more tourists was specific and critical to travelers in the digital age. “I’d like to see the implementation, as opposed to general discussion, of initiatives — such as Wi-Fi in tourism spots — it would be great for Osaka to take the lead nationally in that,” Crofts said A tourism bureau survey conducted between April and July of 4,600 foreigners who used Kansai airport also revealed the need for practical initiatives like better Wi-Fi access, rather than grand projects. But such requests are often ignored by bureaucrats who prefer to focus on the “big picture.” Thus, whether the latest effort to promote Osaka will address such practical needs is something that remains to be seen.",

    "source": "Kyoto aims to be Muslim-friendly city <eos> KYOTO - Kyoto, a city known worldwide as a major center for Buddhism and as the home of some of the country’s most famous Shinto shrines, is stepping up efforts to better welcome one particular group of foreign visitors: Muslims. With the number of Muslim tourists from Malaysia on the rise, thanks to visa restrictions that were eased last July and the growing number of international conferences in the ancient capital being attended by Muslims from Africa, the Middle East and South and Southeast Asia, the city decided earlier this year to formally research better ways meet their needs. Of the nearly 845,000 foreign visitors to Kyoto in 2012 who spent at least one night at a hotel, only about 13,000 were from Malaysia and Indonesia. But that was up from the combined 8,000 or so who visited in 2011, and the figure is expected to grow. In response, Kyoto established a study group to make the city more Muslim-friendly. It consists of hotel managers, convention bureau officials, restaurateurs and others interested in attracting more Muslims. The group receives advice from the Kyoto Muslim Association, which allows Muslims to visit and pray at the mosque inside and which provides information on halal and Muslim-friendly restaurants in Kyoto. Some hotels, such as Hotel Granvia and Kyoto Century Hotel, already offer Muslim-friendly meals, while the Kyoto Rose Café, not far from the association’s headquarters, offers halal meals. There are also Japanese- and English-language websites that list halal and Muslim-friendly establishments in Kyoto. But one idea that the group, under the direction of the Kyoto Muslim Association, is looking at is a more detailed guide to restaurants that are classified as not only “Muslim-friendly” but also “halal,” “Muslim-welcome” and “pork-free.” A restaurant is designated halal when all of its menu items are halal-certified and contain no pork or pork products, and when no alcohol, including cooking wine or mirin (a sweet cooking wine made from rice), is used during the cooking process. Muslim-friendly means the restaurant has both halal and non-halal menus. Muslim-welcome means no pork or alcohol was used in the cooking, but non-halal meats and alcohol are available. Pork-free means just that, but alcohol may have been used in the cooking and the menu is non-halal. In addition to offering prayer rooms facing toward Mecca or taking care to ensure the food served meets the requirements of Muslim customers, there are other issues. Rie Doi, director of tourism promotion at the Kyoto Convention Bureau, notes it is especially important that Kyoto businesses interested in selling their wares to Muslim tourists understand the cultural background of their customers. “For example, some companies may wish to offer certain kinds of souvenirs in colors that are particularly popular in the Muslim world and different from (those) other foreign customers might want,” she said. At the same time, Muslim tourists, no matter where they’re from, ask the same kinds of questions any tourist might ask. A recent report presented to the study group noted that Malaysian Muslims asked their travel agents why they were going to a particular Kyoto temple or shrine and what, exactly, they could do while there. The report said addressing these questions was extremely important to Muslim visitors. But not a few tourists — most with limited time, little or no understanding of Japanese, and a minimal understanding of Kyoto’s history — are likely to want the answers as well.",

    "source": "Mizuho Bank to face one-month suspension of some affiliated loans <eos> The Financial Services Agency will order Mizuho Bank to suspend some of its affiliated loans for a month over its involvement in lending to members of organized crime groups, FSA sources said Wednesday. The FSA will also issue business improvement orders to the Mizuho Financial Group Inc., the sources said, adding the official announcement will likely come Thursday. The order by the financial watchdog will follow one issued to Mizuho Bank in September to improve operations after it left the problem unattended for more than two years despite its knowledge of the matter. The FSA decided to take additional punitive action over the loans to crime groups as the holding company was considered responsible for failing to prevent a false report from being submitted to regulators by the unit bank, the sources said. Mizuho Bank originally said its top management had not been aware of the issue, but it later reversed its claim, with President Yasuhiro Sato saying at a news conference that he and former President Satoru Nishibori were in a position to know about the loans. In late October, the bank submitted a report compiled by a third-party panel that said it found no evidence of a coverup. The FSA launched an additional probe into Mizuho Financial Group and Mizuho Bank on Nov. 5 to verify the contents of the report.",

    "source": "Sacred dance helps preserve community spirit in Tohoku <eos> When Masayuki Sasayama’s house was swept away by the tsunami three years ago, he was temporarily separated from his family and forced to stay in an evacuation shelter, but the tragedy did not stop him from helping preserve his hometown’s “kagura,” a traditional performance art dedicated to Shinto gods. Sasayama, who has been reunited with his family but still lives in temporary housing, is a member of Nanbuhan Jushoin Nengyoji Shihaidaikagura, a group that performs a Shinto dance and plays music dating back to 1699 and which is a vital part of an annual festival in Kamaishi, Iwate Prefecture. Kamaishi is one of the coastal communities devastated by the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami. Seven months after the disasters, the group began performing the dance again on a regular basis, even if it meant having to borrow vital supplies, including drums. Their passion to keep the tradition alive resonated with the private sector and officialdom, both of which have been shifting from post-disaster emergency aid to the long-term rebuilding process that focuses on addressing the psychological care of the affected communities. As a result, financial help has been extended to intangible cultural assets such as festivals, which are abundant in the Tohoku region. Last year, the Iwate Prefectural Government officially recognized the local kagura as an intangible cultural asset. Private organizations such as the Foundation for Cultural Heritage and Art Research have offered aid to ensure that the art is protected, giving the final push for Sasayama’s group to make a “full-fledged comeback.” Aid to intangible cultural assets is part of the foundation’s 2011 “Save our Culture” program launched in the aftermath of the tsunami. Working in cooperation with the New York-based World Monuments Fund, the aim is to preserve and restore cultural heritage, including historic sites and objects damaged on March 11. “Once a disaster strikes, the focus is on securing food items, medical supplies and shelter, but just as important is the emotional care to the affected people,” said the foundation’s executive director, Hiroshi Komiya. The project also has support from the Cultural Affairs Agency. “In the face of a disaster of unprecedented scale, it becomes all the more compelling (for us) to support traditional art and festivals which carry the wishes of reconstruction,” said Satoshi Yamato, the agency’s councilor on cultural properties. Sasayama, whose group is based in the Tadakoe neighborhood in Kamaishi, recounted how he and other members, while still in the evacuation centers and only two days after the disaster, started looking for their instruments and other materials that were washed away by the tsunami. Five lion masks, which are central to the dance, were initially lost, although four were later retrieved. Despite the tragedy and time constraints in preparing for the annual October festival at Ozaki Shrine in Kamaishi, the group pushed through with it. The 46-year-old Sasayama, who learned the art as a child, felt the festival could not begin without their group, which is responsible for carrying the “goshintai,” or “sacred body of the deity,” from an island via ship to the Shinto shrine where the festival is held. “The festival is an important opportunity once a year to bring the community together,” he said. Sasayama, who is self-employed but spends a great deal of time promoting the performance art, said the 3/11 disaster “gave us an even greater sense of crisis that we should be prepared to protect our art just like our forefathers have done.” “We hope that the full-fledged comeback of this traditional performing art could somewhat serve as a source of strength and inspiration to people,” he said. And he is hopeful he can pass on the art to future generations. Tomoya Kikuchi, 15, is one of the youngest performers of the kagura dance. He is ready to inherit the legacy. “I like everything about this art, the dance, the sound of the drums and flute,” said Kikuchi, a Kamaishi-based junior high school student. “Right now, Kamaishi is doing its best to rebuild and I hope our dance can brighten up the spirits of the people here,” he said.",

    "source": "Top kitchenware, plastic sushi lure cooks, tourists alike to Kappabashi <eos> If you want to open a restaurant, the Kappabashi district in Tokyo’s Taito Ward is the place to go because it has everything you need, and more. Situated between the popular Ueno and Asakusa districts, Kappabashi boasts more than 180 shops selling tableware and kitchen equipment for business use and store fixtures. The shops stretch for almost 1 km along the shopping arcade linking Kototoidori Street in the north with Asakusadori Street in the south, showcasing not only kitchenware but also lifelike plastic models of food. Although the arcade is dedicated to the food industry, Kappabashi has in recent years become popular with amateur cooks and tourists, who throw in a visit because of its close proximity to Asakusa. One of the main draws is the skillfully crafted plastic samples of ramen, sushi, tempura, cakes and other food displayed at restaurant entrances throughout Japan. But many also come to purchase top-notch “hocho” (kitchen knives). Some are chefs at Japanese restaurants overseas, but others are merely housewives and husbands with a strong preference for quality cooking utensils and an interest in maintaining them, shop owners said. The origins of Kappabashi date back to the Taisho Era about 100 years ago, when a small group of shops began selling kitchenware. As other shops followed suit, the merchant community gradually grew. Despite the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake and the devastating Tokyo air raids of World War II, Kappabashi never died out. As Japan rebuilt from the war, its food culture diversified, increasing the need for different kinds of kitchenware and handing the industry a big chance. Kappabashi’s merchants thrived. Unlike decades ago, many shops here now cater to general consumers. Each autumn, Kappabashi organizes a bargain event that draws as many as 300,000 people from across the nation. As long as Japan’s food culture grows, Kappabashi will continue to thrive.",

    "source": "Despite hurdles, businesses bring jobs, opportunities back to Tohoku <eos> KAMAISHI, IWATE PREF. - When the March 2011 tsunami smashed the seafood processing factory where Shoichi Sato was working, he lost his job but eventually found a new life. Three years later, Sato is among the businessmen helping to bring back the fishing industry, long a mainstay livelihood for coastal towns dotted along the Tohoku coastline. Sato’s company, Kamaishi Hikari Foods, employs only 25 people but supports hundreds more who sell their catches of octopus, squid, salmon and mackerel for processing right at the water’s edge. In Kamaishi’s Toni district, whose entire port was wrecked by the tsunami, it’s about the only game in town. Businesses throughout the northeast face a reality TV show’s worth of obstacles to setting up shop, from shortages of financing and construction workers and materials, to lengthy delays in administrative approvals and overburdened transport networks. For Sato, it was the Qatar Fund Foundation, established by the Qatari government to help tsunami-damaged areas in Tohoku, and other groups that pitched in with money to buy equipment and advice on how to best run his new business. Sitting in his second-floor office overlooking a wharf under reconstruction, Sato said he got “zero” financial help from the government, which until recently would not approve subsidies for new businesses. Across the region, the government says nearly two-thirds of damaged land has been reclaimed and 78 percent of fishery processing restarted. But for the majority, sales are well below pre-disaster levels. Most damaged stores and other businesses are operating from temporary quarters such as shipping containers and prefabricated huts. The regional economy was in trouble even before the March 11, 2011, Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster that contaminated chunks of the coast with radiation. The 18,520 people dead or missing as a result of the natural disasters were remembered last week as the country marked the third anniversary of the tsunami. Tens of thousands of people are in limbo following the meltdowns at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant, unsure if they ever will be able to resume farming, fishing or other businesses, or even return home. To the north, the seven biggest fish markets in Iwate and Miyagi, the two other prefectures that suffered massive damage from the tsunami, but not radiation, reported a combined catch of 303,629 tons in 2013, down from 444,894 tons in 2010 before the disaster, but up from 169,786 in 2011. It took the prefectural government more than a year to approve Sato’s tiny factory, which uses an innovative freezing process to package fish, seafood and seaweed for direct sales to a Tokyo supermarket and a sushi chain, his main customers. The process causes less damage to cells in the frozen food, improving quality when they are thawed for use in sushi and sashimi. In the Tohoku region, young workers tend to leave to seek work in bigger cities. Fishing pays poorly, costs are rising and there are few other jobs. At the same time, the jobs that do exist go begging: Sato employs three generations of women from one family, from the 63-year-old grandmother to the 18-year-old granddaughter. Some of his employees travel from homes far up the coast to get to work. As in much of the region, about half of Toni’s 1,800 residents are still living in temporary, prefabricated huts. Fed up with delays being resettled in new homes on higher ground, many residents are leaving. “I need to be able to pay the fishermen more for their fish, or they won’t manage to stay in business. That’s apart from making any money here ourselves,” said Sato. He is keen to improve quality through innovations such as testing the salt content of his ice and water for optimal levels for freshness. He works with Japan Fisheries Cooperatives, the alliance of fishery cooperatives that oversees the industry, and helped coordinate the transfer of seed oysters and seaweed beds to tsunami-damaged areas, hurrying along the recovery process. Still, nearly a quarter of fishing-related businesses have closed since the tsunami. In Miyagi Prefecture alone, only 18 of the 142 ports wiped out in the disaster have reopened. In the port of Ogatsu, Miyagi Prefecture, oyster farmer Hiromitsu Ito lost his home, his fishing boats and his oyster beds soon after he had taken out a loan to begin oyster processing. Like Sato, he restarted from scratch. But Ito is innovating with an online business model. His customers pay a membership fee and can buy a share of the catch directly from Ito’s business. Ito and his business partners used funds from the membership fees to help fishermen get back up and running. They are also training newcomers like 23-year-old Yuuki Miura, a fisherman apprentice, hoping to keep the industry alive. “When I was small, I lived with my grandfather and I grew up watching him work,” said Miura. In a region whose population is fast declining and aging, time pressures are felt by all, said Ito, the oyster farmer. “This year is the real deal, it’s the make-it-or-break-it year,” he said.",

    "source": "Are mandatory Kim haircuts a baldfaced lie? <eos> North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s distinctive hairstyle is the ‘do of the day on the Internet, thanks to a viral report that every male university student in the capital is now under orders to get a buzz just like it. But it appears the barbers of Pyongyang aren’t exactly sharpening their scissors. Recent visitors to the country say they have seen no evidence of any mass haircutting. North Korea watchers smell another imaginative but uncorroborated rumor. The thinly sourced reports say an order went out a few weeks ago for university students to buzz-cut the sides of their heads just like Kim. U.S.-based Radio Free Asia cited unnamed sources as saying an unwritten directive from within the ruling Workers’ Party went out this month, causing consternation among students who didn’t think the hairdo would suit them. “I was there just a few days ago, and no sign of that,” said Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours, which brings foreign tourists to North Korea. “It’s definitely not true.” An AP journalist in Pyongyang also said he had not seen any recent changes in hairstyles among college students. Though the forced grooming story may be one of many reported oddities about North Korean life that turn out to be false, it is true that the government has its own “fashion police.” Choe Cheong-ha, a defector who left North Korea in 2004, said members of a government-run youth organization routinely check for people who are not dressed appropriately. They look for whether people are wearing the mandatory lapel pins with the images of former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, or for violations such as blue jeans, clothes with English words or short dresses. But Choe said directives on hairstyles aren’t much of an issue, since most people voluntarily keep their hair neat and conservatively styled.",

    "source": "Economic figures reveal more than you see <eos> The Cabinet Office’s Economic and Social Research Institute on Jan. 17 released the finalized figures on the country’s economy’s stocks (the net value of accumulated assets at a balance date) and flows (net transactions, including income and expenditure, during an accounting period) that were recorded in national accounts in 2012. The preliminary value of transactions covering the October-December period last year has already been released in the form of gross domestic product figures, but the total value of assets in the economy is only disclosed once a year — and almost a year later — because it takes time to confirm the figures. Therefore, the recorded value of assets in the economy as of the end of 2012 is the latest available. As the adjusted totals now go back to 1994, I’d like to review the figures over the past 19 years and highlight a few salient points: First, Japan’s net assets (or national wealth) — calculated by deducting national debt from assets — fell from ¥3,398.9 trillion at the end of 1994 to ¥3,000.3 trillion at the end of 2012 — a loss of ¥398.6 trillion over the past 19 years. Given that the nation’s nominal GDP was ¥472.6 trillion in 2012, the data shows that national wealth equivalent to as much as 84.3 percent of the year’s GDP was lost over the same period. If this is likened to a household’s finances, by extension the value of a family’s assets are 84 percent less than what they were 19 years ago. These figures clearly illustrate the impact of Japan’s “lost decades.” This subsequently raises the question of what has been lost over the past 19 years? Assets are generally divided into financial and nonfinancial assets. Tangible nonproduced assets have comprised the biggest component of the loss — mainly land, which is usually classified as a nonfinancial asset. The net worth of such assets fell by ¥813.9 trillion — from ¥1,958.6 trillion to ¥1,144.7 trillion — over 19 years. One of the two main factors behind the decline is of course the ongoing hangover from the asset-inflated bubble economy of the late 1980s and early ’90s. In addition, land has been exposed to market competition across national borders in such forms as the overseas transfer of manufacturing plants. In other words, Japanese land is still expensive by international standards. Finally, I’d like to highlight the changes in the ratio between financial and nonfinancial assets. In 1996, financial assets accounted for 59.7 percent of the total versus 40.3 percent for nonfinancial assets. In 2012, the ratio of financial assets was up nearly 10 percentage points to 68.9 percent, with the nonfinancial assets accounting for 31.1 percent. What these changes signify is that Japanese companies and households have become more defensive in a bid to maintain the liquidity of their assets. On the other hand, expenditure in Japan’s public sector has increased, with the private sector investing in most of the public bonds that have been issued to finance that expenditure. Needless to say, this has led to a stalemate in public-sector finances and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. People tend to pay attention to GDP — statistics of short-term transactions — as an indicator of economic trends. However, it is also important to watch figures pertaining to economic assets that reflect the accumulation of the total value of such transactions.

    "source": "Bitcoin believers unfazed by losses in Mt. Gox collapse <eos> Like other bitcoin evangelists, Ken Shishido is ready to write off the money he lost in the bankruptcy of Tokyo-based virtual currency exchange Mt. Gox as the price of revolutionizing global finance. “In the early days of the automobile, there were traffic accidents because you didn’t have traffic lights or pedestrian crossings,” he said Friday, hours after Mt. Gox said it had lost up to half a billion dollars of investor funds, including some of his. “But we didn’t ban automobiles.” Shishido, who lives in Tokyo, was one of about 10,000 investors in Japan who became creditors in Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy when the company capped a tumultuous period of weeks by filing for bankruptcy on Friday. He lost about a tenth of his investment in bitcoin in Mt. Gox, he said, and expected none of that money to come back. Early enthusiasts for the 5-year-old crypto-currency were drawn to its revolutionary ideals of transparency and a lack of central or official control. There was also a heady mix of geek chic — the currency is “mined” through a process involving complex computer math — and laissez-faire Austrian economics. Mt. Gox’s loss is eye-popping, but so too is the number of creditors — 127,000 — in what had been the world’s biggest exchange. That means the average trader lost the equivalent of $3,500 in the bankruptcy at current bitcoin prices, assuming no money is recovered in the court-supervised restructuring that is set to play out in Tokyo over the coming months. Bitcoin’s value spiked in April 2013 as the crisis-racked Cyprus government clamped down on withdrawals and seized deposits, rattling faith in “fiat” currencies created by government declaration. The crypto-currency soon crashed back. Late last year, as the number of exchanges and its name recognition grew, it took off again. It gained wider acceptance and attracted speculators and high-profile proponents such as the investor twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Facebook fame. Investors interviewed after the exchange collapsed faulted Mt. Gox and its French CEO, Mark Karpeles, but they remained committed to the bitcoin idea. Roger Ver, a big investor in Mt. Gox, said he did not know if he would ever get any of his lost bitcoin back. “But the important thing to realize is that Mt. Gox is just one company using bitcoin. The bitcoin technology itself is still absolutely amazing,” he said. “Even if one email service provider is having a problem, that doesn’t mean people are going to stop using email. It’s the same with bitcoin.” Ver spoke of “all of the positive ways in which bitcoin is going to change the world. . . . If anything, it is kind of for the better of bitcoin that the irresponsible players are going out of business.” Shishido said he does not expect to get his virtual money back, but that the rest of his bitcoin investments had soared 10-fold in value. Keiichi Hida, a bitcoin investor and member of the Japan Digital Money Association, lost ¥100,000 worth of bitcoins, which he got involved with as a form of “study.” But he was unfazed. “We should make it a national project to have bitcoin used nationwide at the time of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics,” he said. “I think then everyone would come to Tokyo in an instant.” Mt. Gox CEO Karpeles, even after bowing to apologize for the exchange’s bankruptcy, later said the currency will endure. “The bitcoin industry is continuing, and the most important thing now is to limit the impact of (Mt. Gox’s collapse) on that,” he said.",

    "source": "When it comes to tourism, image is everything <eos> During his re-election campaign these past two weeks, one of the lesser-known successes touted by Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto was the Osaka Government Tourism Bureau, which he set up to promote the area to tourists and convention organizers. The new bureau marks the latest effort by a town, city or prefecture in Kansai to distinguish itself and grab a piece of the domestic and international tourism pie. But when promoting themselves overseas and, to a lesser extent, within Japan, the first and most fundamental problem is the region’s weak or nonexistent presence in the minds of would-be visitors. Despite recent efforts to coordinate tourism efforts, politicians are still very much in competition with each other, and even well-known Kansai cities are seeking new ways to re-brand themselves. One way is through food. Not too long ago, relatively little thought was given to Kansai cuisine’s potential as a tourist draw. But now fussy foodies in search of the perfect can’t-find-it-in-Tokyo-or-anywhere-else meal, made with fresh ingredients grown locally, are being targeted by promotion campaigns. These efforts are only expected to grow after “washoku,” or traditional Japanese cuisine, was added to UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list in December. In Kansai, Kyoto’s restaurant industry played an influential role in pushing for the listing. Japan’s well-known cultural capital appears to have the least to be concerned about when it comes to image. But thanks to the renewed attention Japanese food has received from the UNESCO heritage listing, Kyoto is re-branding itself as a source of health food cuisine by touting local ingredients like “kujo negi,” a kind of leek. Restaurants specializing in the use of local produce have been springing up in and around the touristy Kiyomachi area. Other prefectures are also promoting their food and drinks. In Nara, long thought of as the one place in Kansai with an undistinguished cuisine, city officials now proudly boast of local strawberries. In Wakayama Prefecture, plum-based products, especially homemade “ume-shu” liquor, are proliferating at shops in Kansai that cater to tourists. And Tottori hopes beef-eaters in Kansai, after they’ve paid a visit to Kobe, will come up to their prefecture and sample the local Olein 55 beef that, despite its rather unappetizing name, enjoys the promotional support of the central government. Yet efforts in and around Kansai to create an image via food are likely to see limited success overseas. For starters, there is a severe lack of information in English about restaurants in the localities where the touted food originates, or even about restaurants in major Kansai cities dedicated to a particular delicacy or cuisine. In addition, unless you are as obsessed as those promoting their cuisine and its distinctive characteristics, it’s unlikely you’ll remember, for example, that the soup you ate contained Kyoto, not Shiga, leeks after you’ve returned home, or care much about the difference between Kobe beef and Tottori beef. And what about Osaka? After years of trying to promote the city as the “kitchen of Japan” — an effort that met with only mixed success — officials have switched gears somewhat and are trying to promote the city as an entertainment center. Music is a big part of this campaign. When it comes to Western, or American, music, Kobe has long been known as the heart of Kansai’s jazz scene, while back in the 1970s Kyoto was famous for its blues bars. Today, however, Osaka is attempting to reinvent itself as a major international jazz center. To that end, it will host its Third International Jazz Day, another UNESCO-endorsed project, on April 30. Presented in partnership with the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, the event features workshops with famous musicians from around the world, and concludes with a concert in Osaka Castle Park that evening. Even as Osaka aspires to become an international jazz mecca like Paris or Stockholm, the region will continue to promote itself as an Asian gateway. Indeed, since Kansai International Airport opened in 1994, touting its Asian connections has been the one consistent theme in the otherwise numerous, and at times schizophrenic, efforts to create a lasting domestic and international image. Yet what those connections are, beyond trade relations, or why Asian tourists should automatically prefer modern Kansai over the more traditional parts of Japan is never made clear. With the central government announcing earlier this year that it hopes to attract 20 million foreign visitors to Japan by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics — about double last year’s number — promotional efforts throughout Japan are expected to increase. Over the next six years, we can look forward to all manner of attempts by prefectures, towns and even villages to create a recognizable image that will lead to increased tourism revenue or at least sales of local products. PR efforts resulting from such attempts may appear a bit desperate at times. But Kansai-area officials in particular worry that unless foreigners form a strong image of the region as a whole by then, those who do venture outside of Tokyo in search of adventure will go to a part of the country that has managed to create not only a good image, but also a unique one promising something other than the same kind of food, music and entertainment that can be found pretty much anywhere in Japan. Or the world.",

    "source": "Historical ifs and weathers or not <eos> To suggest that history is shaped by chance weather events and climatic variation doesn’t lend it quite the same gravitas as if it were wrought by great leaders. It certainly isn’t as inspirational. But such processes can be just as important — and the weather can sometimes foil even the best-laid plans for world domination. Take the storms that blew up off Kyushu in 1274 and 1281. Luckily for Japan, they happened just as Kublai Khan and his Mongol horde were trying to invade. Later named kamikaze (divine winds), the storms helped repel the Mongols — but what has not been appreciated is that climate change had helped them to expand their empire in the first place. Mongolia is a country of extremes, with short, hot summers and long winters in which temperatures of minus 30 degrees are not unusual. It doesn’t rain much, and during most of the year — on average for 257 days — the sky is cloudless. But it hasn’t always been so across those boundless tracts of central Asia. Amy Hessl from the department of geology and geography at West Virginia University, and colleagues, studied tree-ring data from 107 living and dead Siberian pines in central Mongolia stretching back more than 1,100 years. The rings — made by new growth each year — can be used for dating, but also to make inferences, mainly from their widths, about the climate. Hessl, working with Neil Pederson of the Tree Ring Lab at Columbia University, New York, found they could pick out the big climatic events of the past 1,000 years. From 950-1250 there was an unusual warming called the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Then, from around 1350-1850, there was a cold snap that’s now dubbed the Little Ice Age. But the most unusual thing the team found was a persistent wet period in Mongolia from 1211-25 which, they suggest, boosted grassland productivity. For a culture based on horses and other livestock, this was incredibly beneficial. At the time of this sudden increase in fodder, the ruler of Mongolia was one Genghis Khan. Under him, the empire grew to reach as far west as central Europe and as far east as the shores of Japan, becoming the largest — in terms of contiguous land area — that the world has ever seen. Adverse climate events such as drought are often linked with the decline of complex societies, said Hessl. But what hasn’t been much studied is the opposite: The link between beneficial conditions and a rise in the complexity of a society. (The work is published in the journal PNAS, DOI reference: 10.1073/pnas.1318677111.) By the time Genghis Khan’s grandson, Kublai, came to power in 1260, Korea was a tributary state of the Mongols known as Goryeo. But Kublai Khan wanted Japan, too, and he amassed huge fleets for his invasion attempts in both 1274 and ’81 — with an arsenal that included devastating gunpowder bombs. Faced with this common foe, on both occasions Japan’s samurai fought together rather than battling among themselves as they had always done. For all their fabled prowess, though, they were stymied by their age-old rules of engagement which involved warriors calling out the name of an enemy with whom to engage in single combat. Similarly, archers would take aim at just one target, and fight in single combat by firing arrows at each other. The Mongols paid no heed to such stuff, instead sweeping into the Japanese en masse, killing and maiming any which way they could — including by loosing fire arrows, poison arrows or ceramic shells filled with gunpowder into their ranks. It was only a storm in 1274 and a typhoon in 1281 that led to the Mongols’ defeats, as their fleets were scattered and sunk. Yet the Japanese victories engendered a sense of invincibility that persisted until 1945. But it’s not all ancient history. The tree-ring data also show the effect of a drought afflicting Mongolia in the present century. This is a mark of the Anthropocene, the era of history in which human activities themselves influence the climate and impact Earth’s ecosystems. The warming we’ve seen over central Asia of late is related to human activity, said team member Kevin Anchukaitis of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. But that doesn’t mean it is possible to state scientifically that particular events — such as Mongolia’s drought — are caused by global warming. “It is difficult to attribute the 21st-century drought in Mongolia to climate change,” he said. But he expects warming to “become even more of a factor in future droughts.” Hessl agreed that droughts are going to be more likely. “We would expect to see similar events in the future based on past moisture variation in Mongolia and predictions of warming in the region,” she said. The contention that history is shaped by climate — with the British Empire, for instance, said to have been built by a people escaping their homeland’s grim weather — may not be so wide of the mark after all.",

    "source": "Trade deals trump sex slave issue for Osakans <eos> When Osaka Mayor and Nippon Ishin no Kai (Japan Restoration Party) co-leader Toru Hashimoto uttered his infamous remarks last May that Japan’s wartime sex slave system was necessary at the time, he was roundly — and rightly — condemned at home and abroad. It was clear then, and clearer today, that the real reason he got in trouble was because he was caught saying out loud what many Japanese of his generation, and not a few elders in the government — including, perhaps, at the highest levels — truly believe but refuse to say directly. However, recent events have loosened the floodgates of candor. Today, Abe’s government is locked in a tense standoff with South Korea over the “comfort women” issue. Every ambitious right-wing politician in Japan who can find a microphone is now repeating at full volume what Hashimoto said 10 months ago. Compared to the spit and venom coming out of sex slave deniers in Tokyo and elsewhere, Hashimoto’s comments last year are increasingly sounding intelligent and restrained. Yes, that’s how bad it’s gotten. But what Hashimoto’s critics have never fully appreciated is that while he opened a Pandora’s box with his comfort women comments, it was a topic an entire generation was curious about. Raised on historical revisionist manga, ignorant of either the facts or the morality of the issue, the “Hashimoto Generation” became angry and confused when confronted by a past they never knew and the vague replies of their elders in the political and social mainstream when they tried to learn. Only the historical revisionist camp seemed to have, conveniently enough, all of the “facts.” The young Hashimoto Generation’s anger warmed the hearts of Japan’s old right-wingers. It also allowed them to now pose as wise, experienced leaders who were — depending on which think tank audience or television camera they or their foreign apologists were addressing — “realists,” “moderates,” or “pragmatists” who would, in the end, rein in the young hotheads so as not to upset the status quo. Today, however, nobody seems to know how to handle either the comfort women controversy or the younger generation. Hashimoto may have started the current fire. But to lump him in with the crude right-wing politicians now fanning the flames risks misunderstanding the mayor and, more generally, his Osaka followers and how they see the broader relationship with the Korean people. Nearly 1,000 years before political power shifted to Tokyo in the 17th century, Korean and Chinese merchants were trading in Osaka. In the late 20th century, a strong community of Korean residents led the way in local human rights education. Many Osakans who support Hashimoto’s economic policies grew up with Korean neighbors, friends and colleagues. Of course, it’s not surprising that they feel they “know” Koreans quite well. Such supporters have little if any true love for all the yelling about the comfort women issue and they are particularly disgusted by anti-Korean hate speech. Those politicians elsewhere banging on about the sex slave issue are increasingly seen in Osaka as opportunists who have no real interest in pursuing a lasting solution or listening to Korean concerns. Thus, the Hashimoto Generation as a whole may have wanted answers to the comfort women issue and now believes revisionist claims the historical facts are not “settled.” But in Osaka, you can also find those who believe, rightly or wrongly, that their city’s trade and cultural history with Korea combined with a traditional merchant’s disdain for rigid politics means their odds of success in “doing a deal” — quietly, behind the scenes — with South Korea are better than anybody shouting in the streets of other cities, especially Tokyo’s.

    "source": "Key firms agree to hike pay scales <eos> Many major firms notified their labor unions Wednesday that they will raise pay scales to conclude this year’s spring wage negotiations, responding to strong calls from the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to help end long-standing deflation. Toyota Motor Corp., which has huge influence over other companies, will raise its average monthly pay scale by ¥2,700, while Honda Motor Co. is planning a ¥2,200 increase. Likewise, six major electronics firms, including Hitachi Ltd. and Panasonic Corp., will raise their wage scales by ¥2,000 per month, the highest on record for the sector. Although management in many of these companies failed to fully meet labor unions’ demands, these will be the first hikes in six years, reflecting significant improvement in their business performances partly stemming from the yen’s weakness, which benefits exporters. A pay scale hike involves uniformly lifting a company’s basic wage other than a seniority-based regular wage increase. It often results in a rise in labor costs, as pension benefits are calculated based on the basic wage. Realizing wage hikes is considered a key for success of Abe’s economic policies dubbed “Abenomics,” which aim to bring about a “virtuous cycle” of increases in corporate earnings, wages and consumption to conquer nearly two decades of deflation. Some companies plan to fully accept labor unions’ demands over annual bonuses, while Nissan Motor Co. will also raise the monthly pay scale by ¥3,500 to fully satisfy the demand. The moves are thanks to the administration’s rare and strong calls on companies to hike wages. Unions have seen some success during negotiations in this year’s “shunto” spring pay talks, with many of them winning a pay-scale increase. “This will be a major driving force for our country to exit from deflation and achieve economic revival,” economic and fiscal policy minister Akira Amari told reporters, adding the response of management was “beyond expectations.” Hiromasa Yonekura, the head Keidanren, the nation’s most influential business lobby, said the move by major companies is a “result of firms sharing recognition that (a wage increase) is needed to overcome deflation and realize a virtuous economic cycle.” The focus now shifts to whether such moves will spread to medium-size and small companies as well as nonregular workers, a development considered necessary if the economy is to withstand a possible downturn in demand as a result of the consumption tax hike that is coming April 1. On top of manufacturing companies, many firms in the service industry will raise wages, with convenience store chain Lawson Inc. moving to increase its pay scale for the first time in 12 years after agreeing to fully meet its labor union’s demand for an average pay scale hike of ¥3,000 per month. Meanwhile, Suzuki Motor Corp. decided to forgo a pay scale hike due to concerns about the business environment, including the uncertain outlook for emerging economies. Struggling electronics makers Sharp Corp. and Pioneer Corp. will also skip a pay scale increase as their labor unions refrained from submitting demands, effectively withdrawing from the unified labor talks of major electronics companies. In addition to export-oriented manufacturing firms that benefit from a weak yen, nonmanufacturers such as restaurant operators and retailers, which enjoy brisk business thanks to robust domestic demand, will raise their pay scales. This will help mitigate the adverse impact of the consumption tax hike, said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “The government now needs to promote a growth strategy, including a corporate tax cut as well as tax breaks to support families with children, in order to prevent a further decline in population and bolster domestic demand,” Miyamae said. At a news conference in Tokyo, labor leaders welcomed the pay hikes, saying unions were able to meet their goals to a certain extent. “We considered (the wage hikes) as a concrete step for pulling Japan out of deflation and realizing a virtuous economic cycle,” said Yasunobu Aihara, president of the Confederation of Japan Automobile Workers’ Unions.",

    "source": "Back on track: Sanriku Railway's long road to recovery <eos> OFUNATO, IWATE PREF. - A little more than three years after the devastating earthquake paralyzed the northeast, coastal communities shattered by the ensuing tsunami are slowly returning to normal. Shops that were destroyed are gradually reopening. Residents forced to evacuate to distant parts are returning to their hometowns. And soon, communities along the coast of Iwate Prefecture will take another step toward recovery: Sanriku Railway Co. is set to restart full-scale operation of its South Rias and North Rias lines. Train runs are set to resume on a 15-km stretch between Yoshihama and Kamaishi stations on the southern line Saturday, and on a 10.5-km stretch between Omoto and Tanohata stations on the northern line Sunday. Covering most of Iwate’s coastline, Sanriku Railway’s two lines were a central part of life for many residents before the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. But the railway was crippled by the tsunami after its train cars were flooded beyond repair and entire sections of track were swallowed whole. “Seeing the state the tracks were in, I thought we would never recover,” said Shoichi Kumagai, a 30-year veteran at Sanriku Railway. “It seemed like the world was about to break apart,” he said, recalling the magnitude-9.0 earthquake. “Immediately following the disasters, everyone was just trying to survive,” he said. “But as soon as things settled down, I had people come up to me and ask, ‘Can we ride the train yet?’ “ With roads destroyed or blocked by rubble, the people at Sanriku Railway knew they had to act quickly. The North Rias Line resumed operation just five days after the quake, carrying passengers free of charge across the small portion of tracks that was left undamaged. The South Rias Line, however, was more severely damaged and took more than two years for partial operations to resume. It was not just the trains and tracks, however, that needed to be repaired. The station buildings and bridges also took severe damage, and the South Rias Line’s main office in the city of Ofunato was flooded by tsunami. “The seawater filled the first floor, so all of the employees fled to the second floor office,” Kumagai said. Many of Sanriku Railway’s employees were themselves victims of the disaster. Taiki Sato, 28, had been working there as an engineer for less than a year when the quake and tidal waves hit. “My wife was pregnant then, and her parents’ house got washed away in the tsunami. We both lived out of our workplaces after that, on constant standby.” “Now that all operations are going back online, it’s really hitting home that things are returning back to normal,” Saito said. For the past three years, Sanriku Railway has worked with the government-backed Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency to rebuild its facilities. The roughly ¥10 billion in rebuilding costs were originally to be shared by the railway, the Iwate Prefectural Government and the central government. But the central government ended up shouldering the entire cost. The railway also received support from outside Japan. Kuwait donated roughly ¥40 billion in crude oil to the three prefectures most heavily damaged by the disasters, and Iwate used part of its share to buy five new train cars for Sanriku Railway. Residents along the lines are more than eager for the trains to be restored. “I used to take my children on the southern line all the time when they were little,” said Kuniko Minawa, 65. “It was sad having train tracks but no train running on them. Once it starts back up, I’d like to take the train to see my husband’s old house.” Haruka Mori, 18, said: “I always use Sanriku Railway to come to Ofunato to hang out. I want to ride the entire length of the southern line when it starts up again.” “There’s still a lot of rebuilding to do, but the resumption of the Sanriku lines makes me think progress is becoming more visible,” Mori said. Starting full operation is only the first step in Sanriku Railway’s rebirth, however. Like many other small regional train lines, the North Rias and South Rias lines suffer from a dearth of regular customers. Populations in the countryside are on the decline, and more and more people use cars to get around. Sanriku Railway has worked to cover those losses by attracting tourists from other prefectures, operating special event trains, such as the Disaster Education Train, in which company employees lecture passengers on the damage the Great East Japan Earthquake wreaked on the railway and surrounding areas, and the Omiai Train, where passengers sit face to face in search of a potential marriage partner. The number of tourists riding the Sanriku lines also got a boost from a cameo appearance by the North Rias Line in the hugely popular TV drama “Amachan.” But with the six-day-a-week, half-year-long show ending six months ago, it remains to be seen whether the railway lines can sustain the growth in popularity. “We received kind words and support from people all over Japan, and I think the only way we can show our thankfulness is to show that we have more passengers now than ever,” said Sanriku Railway’s Kumagai. “Of course we want local passengers, but we want to plan all kinds of events so that people from outside Iwate will visit disaster-struck areas,” he said.",

    "source": "Pulmonary pest ravages; study of racial hygienics urged; Japan mourns Gen. MacArthur; Takeshita resigns over Recruit scandal <eos> 100 YEARS AGO Tuesday, April 21, 1914 Chiba ravaged by pulmonary pest The dreadful pulmonary pest (pneumonic plague) has plunged districts of Omikawa and Moriyama-mura, Chiba, into consternation. The physicians and police officials, who are working to check the spread of the disease, facing imminent danger almost every minute, are greatly hampered in their efforts by a scarcity of workmen, even when offered tempting wages, and the unwillingness of local physicians and nurses to assist them. All physicians and police officers engaged in quarantine work are dreaded by the local people as the pest itself. They are shunned on the road and refused lodging. The sixth death from the plague in the district occurred Saturday. At present two adults and a child are lying near death, suspected of the disease, in a temporary shed. The crude asylum has been prepared in an isolated spot and enclosed with a fence of tin sheets. Police-Inspector Mano and other officers, refused lodging in Omikawa and Moriyama, are obliged to lodge in Sawara. Only a few workmen agreed to help build the isolation asylum. A cask of sake was always placed in the workshop to spur on the men, who drew the liquor freely from it during their work to inspire them with courage. Since the initial outbreak of the plague in Tokyo’s Fukagawa district, 72 fatal cases have been reported. At present, 1,315 patients are in hospitals. The quarantine director, Mr. Kunizawa, says that there is no positive way of putting an end to the plague, but it will die out of itself when more regular weather sets in. 75 YEARS AGO Wednesday, April 12, 1939 Racial hygienic course at universities urged Supporting a suggestion by Dr. Koichi Miyake, Professor of Tokyo Imperial University’s Medical College, the Gakujitsu Shinko-kai (Academic Promotion Society) is planning to propose to the Education Ministry the opening of a course on racial hygienics at various medical colleges. The proposed course would offer study on inter-racial blood mixture, heredity, mental and hygienic problems between races. Should it be brought to existence, the course will be the first of its kind in this country. Dr. Miyake has been studying various problems pertaining to blood mixture among the Oriental races, particularly among Japanese, Chinese, Manchous (people from the then-extant state of Manchukuo) and Chosenese (Koreans). He is an ardent advocate of inter-racial marriage for the solution of the problems of the East. 50 YEARS AGO Tuesday, April 7, 1964 U.S. Gen. MacArthur mourned by Japan A cable conveying the condolence of Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako on the death of Gen. Douglas MacArthur was sent to Mrs. MacArthur, widow of the deceased five-star general, Monday. MacArthur died of acute kidney and liver failure at Walter Reed Medical Center, Maryland, early Monday morning Japan time. He was 84. Japanese political leaders were also quick to send messages. In a message to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda said: “I wish to express to the American people my deepest sympathies over the passing of Gen. MacArthur. The general, as a courageous patriot and a loyal citizen, served his country brilliantly throughout his life. The Japanese people remember him with affection not only a great soldier but also a friend of this country. “Gen. MacArthur, representing the victors, dedicated himself with sympathy and farsightedness to the reconstruction of Japan after World War II. I wish to express my grief on the occasion of his death.” Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ohira, in a cable to Mrs. MacArthur, said: “The passing of your beloved husband is a source of painful sorrow for us in Japan. Now that he has performed his duties in this world, we pray that he will rest in peace.” 25 YEARS AGO Wednesday, April 26, 1989 Takeshita says he will resign over scandal Noboru Takeshita announced Tuesday he will step down as prime minister after the Diet passes the nation’s 1989 budget. In a nationally televised news conference, Takeshita, 65, expressed “profound apologies” to the nation for the loss of faith caused by the Recruit influence-buying scandal. The prime minister declined to disclose whom he had in mind as his successor. He said he did not want to influence the ruling party’s selection of a new president — a position that carries with it the prime ministership because of the LDP’s majority in the Diet. At the start of his 30-minute news conference, Takeshita read a message addressed to the nation. “The widespread public distrust of politics triggered by the Recruit case has created a very serious crisis for parliamentary democracy in our country,” he said. Takeshita has been under intensive criticism because large amounts of funds were provided to him by Hiromasa Ezoe, former chairman of Recruit Co. Ezoe is now under indictment on charges of bribing government officials. Takeshita admitted in the Diet earlier that he and his associates had accepted ¥151 million in political donations, fundraiser ticket sales and share-sale profits from the Recruit group. Last week it came to light that he borrowed ¥50 million more from Ezoe in 1987 in the name of an aide, Ihei Aoki. Takeshita and his rivals were then vying for the LDP presidency before the term of former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone ended in November. Takeshita’s planned resignation comes as public approval for his Cabinet has hit a historic low. Analysts tie the reaction not only to the Recruit case but to the controversial 3 percent sales tax that was implemented April 1.",

    "source": "Atrophied Osaka changes mindset toward entrepreneurs <eos> Osaka has long been known as a merchant city, home to small but innovative businesses ranging from consumer electronics to processed foods. But the city where young entrepreneurs once flourished has recently found itself playing second fiddle to Tokyo. No matter where they’re from, Japanese — especially younger ones who come up with hit ideas — end up taking them to Tokyo because its sheer size means new thinking gets embraced in ways that Osaka and, indeed, the Kansai region, just do not. College graduates from western Japan often prefer to remain in Kansai, especially if they know they will have to help take care of their elderly parents soon. Many have dreams of starting their own business. But if they’re operating in the popular IT sector or the service industry, Kansai is just too small, or too conservative, for most young entrepreneurs, — even if they have a good idea and can find funding. In addition, long-established ties, family connections with customers and suppliers, and a host of other hidden realities can make it difficult for outsiders, especially in the service industry, to succeed. Newcomers are viewed less as potential partners with ideas for increasing profit, and more as potential rivals with ideas that can put the established players out of business. In recent years, the city of Osaka has begun to recognize that such thinking is killing the local economy and tax base. Whatever one thinks of Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, he is surrounded by younger supporters, many of them entrepreneurs or self-employed professionals fed up with the area’s fossilized attitudes toward developing entrepreneurs. At Business Innovation Center Osaka, Chie Yamano is aware of the need to encourage budding businesspeople. “People can come in off the street and get advice about starting a business in Osaka. We can look at their business plans, provide advice on where to find local lawyers, accountants and real estate agents. We hold seminars for startup businesses, and can make introductions to potential business partners,” Yamano said. Real estate in parts of Osaka is dirt cheap, and the cost of living is generally less than that of Tokyo. But costs are not everything. Contacts and access to startup capital are also crucial. Unlike Tokyo, Osaka and the Kansai region in general lack the number and types of groups needed to match entrepreneurs with investors. One place getting attention for its attempt to unite young entrepreneurs in Osaka is Knowledge Salon. The organization, based in the Grand Front Osaka building that opened last year, is part of the larger Knowledge Capital facility and holds lectures, workshops and other business-related events. “Our members come from a wide variety of backgrounds, and have a broad range of interests, but there are many here who have an interest in forming their own business and are looking for potential partners or collaborators,” said Yu Sekiguchi, an assistant manager at Knowledge Capital. Virtually all official interest in, and attention to, nurturing entrepreneurship in Kansai is focused on sectors that the central and local governments and Kansai business organizations run by huge corporations have deemed priorities. These include pharmaceuticals, biotech, medicine and even tourism, if Kyoto is included. But what about the service industries? Food is an especially cutthroat business in Kansai. Any chef, wannabe chef, or budding restaurateur with dreams of becoming Japan’s version of Wolfgang Puck or Jamie Oliver will find that, while it’s fairly easy to set up a restaurant, keeping it going is another matter. While Osaka claims it’s the kitchen of Japan, outsiders often see Kyoto, a huge destination for domestic and international tourists, as the potentially better market. However, the Kyoto restaurant industry is quite closed, and despite efforts on the part of the city to promote Kyoto cuisine nationally and internationally, only entrepreneurs with unique ideas and an ability to adjust to the “Kyoto standard” of preparing and serving food — regardless of whether that food is traditional Japanese fare or not — are likely to succeed. That said, compared to just a decade ago, one can see a greater number of younger restaurateurs in Kyoto today, many of whom are focusing on specialized cuisine, especially macrobiotic, vegetarian and organic dishes prepared with locally grown produce. “There are definitely opportunities for a certain type of restaurant owner in Kyoto. The food has to be unique, but not too unique, of high quality, but still affordable and adjusted to Kansai tastes, which are different from Tokyo tastes and often less spicy. It also helps if you can create a cozy or even exclusive atmosphere,” said Jiro Fujii, an Osaka-based restaurant consultant who advises potential clients about Kansai. After the March 11, 2011, Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, Kansai’s leaders hoped concerns about further damage would lead to an influx of younger people who wanted to escape Tokyo and start over. That has not happened to the extent some predicted. In fact, the worry among Kansai politicians and business leaders is that, given the rapidly aging population, declining birth rate and a possible accelerated shift to Tokyo ahead of the 2020 Olympics, the region, especially Osaka, will continue to lose business. Freelance journalist Yuji Yoshitomi, in a recent book about Osaka, warned that without an economic recovery, the city will likely go the way of Detroit — run-down and bankrupt. Yamano admits the city needs to do more to bring in young entrepreneurs. But she said there is an understanding among the younger generation of Osaka leaders that they need to do more to encourage entrepreneurs and that now, actually, is the time for Japanese with an entrepreneurial bent to get established. It’s a message Osaka has paid lip service to for decades, though. Despite a myriad of competitive advantages on paper (excellent transportation systems, good living environment, lower cost of living, access to a huge pool of young labor via the universities), only time will tell if the latest message of “Come west, young entrepreneur” marks the beginning of the long-awaited, much-promised, and not yet realized Osaka, and Kansai, renaissance.",

    "source": "Asia's worst-smelling fish a South Korean delicacy <eos> MOKPO, SOUTH KOREA - The aroma of one of South Korea’s most popular delicacies is regularly compared to rotting garbage and filthy bathrooms — and that is by its fans. The unusual dish is typically made by taking dozens of fresh skates, a cartilage-rich fish that looks like a stingray, stacking them up in a walk-in refrigerator and waiting — up to a month in some cases. “You know when it’s done by the smell,” said Kang Han-joo, co-owner of a seafood store in the bustling fish market of Mokpo, a port city on the southwestern tip of the Korean Peninsula, a region that is considered the food’s spiritual home. As Kang spoke, he sliced small, stinking, glistening dark-pink fish steaks with a large knife and laid them in plastic foam boxes for shipment to customers around South Korea. The smell of the fish, which is called “hongeo” in Korean and usually eaten uncooked, is unmistakable, unavoidable and a deal breaker for many. A profound, pungent stink of ammonia radiates from the animal after it has been ripening for weeks. First-timers often squeeze their eyes shut as they chew. Tears stream down the cheeks. The throat constricts with the effort of swallowing. Kang notes, in a dramatic understatement, “When it’s fermented a long time, the smell becomes deeper.” Americans are still getting used to gentler fermented Asian foods — spicy Korean kimchi and Japanese miso, for example — yet many South Koreans claim a love — an addiction, even — for this extreme form of fermentation. Restaurants specializing in the fish can be found throughout the United States. One online hongeo appreciation society boasts more than 1,300 members. “Some people start to crave it as soon as they smell the ammonia,” said Shin Jin-woo, a seafood store worker in Mokpo. “There’s no need to advertise how intense the smell is. Everyone already knows.” Shin’s store has two fermentation refrigerators. Walk into one and a blast of ammonia burns the eyes, the nose and sinuses, the tongue, throat and lungs. Skates are fermented up to 15 days in the first refrigerator, where the temperature is 2.5 degrees Celsius (36.5 Fahrenheit), and up to another 15 days in the second refrigerator at 1 C (34 F). Shops in Mokpo custom-ferment the fish and ship the results to restaurants and hongeo fans around South Korea. The vast majority of the more than 11,000 tons of hongeo consumed in the country comes not from South Korean-caught fish but from cheaper frozen imports. Shop owners thaw and clean the imported fish, which can cost up to five times less than the local version, and place the hongeo in refrigerators to ferment. Hongeo’s history is murky, but it emerged in the days before refrigeration, when food that could keep for a long time without rotting was prized. Someone — maybe a fisherman on a long voyage or a clever, hungry or desperate farmer — discovered that skate didn’t spoil as easily as other fish, and a dish was born. Shop owners say the traditional method of making hongeo is to put the fish on a bed of hay in a clay pot, pile more hay on top and leave it. Learning to love, or at least tolerate, what many consider the smelliest fish in Asia takes perseverance. Fans commonly say that if you try it four times, you will be hooked. People who aren’t fans may be mystified by how anyone could meet that threshold. “It’s a freaking punch in the face,” said Joe McPherson, the founder of ZenKimchi, a Korean food blog, and an eventual devotee of the fish. “Like everyone else, I gagged the first time.” Natives of the southwest say hongeo should be eaten plain. They sometimes complain that the copious garnishes provided at restaurants disguise the taste and smell. Most first-timers, however, tend to embrace all the extras they can, creating a hongeo “sandwich” with garnishes that can include red pepper paste, salty miniature shrimp, raw garlic, chili salt, slices of fatty boiled pork and some extraordinarily strong kimchi. Even with “some of the most powerful flavors in the world to put up against it . . . it does not cover up the flavor at all,” McPherson said. The extremely chewy texture — spongy flesh and hard cartilage — also makes for tough swallowing. And the smell of ammonia is so powerful it lingers for hours on clothes, skin and hair. The second time, if there is one, is usually a little better. One trick is to inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose while eating. This helps fight the smell some and also intensifies a surprising tingling and cooling — almost minty — sensation in the mouth, throat and face. There are various theories explaining the food’s popularity. Some Koreans describe their craving as similar to the desire for a cigarette: You want it despite its obvious negatives of doing so. McPherson says the fish is also valued for its interesting texture and the sensation it produces in the mouth — two things that can be as important to Koreans as flavor. There is also something convivial about hongeo restaurants, where large amounts of strong Korean booze are as ubiquitous as the fish. Still, while some Korean restaurants in the United States serve hongeo, it is unlikely to catch on except “in hard-core foodie circles,” McPherson said. “I can see maybe college fraternities hazing their freshmen with this, but it’s very much a ‘dare’ food, like live octopus.”",

    "source": "Now is the time to research Alzheimer's <eos> The team leader at the Laboratory for Proteolytic Neuroscience at Riken’s Brain Science Institute is not a man usually given to making apocalyptic statements. Yet when I asked him whether Japan should be investing more money in Alzheimer’s research, he responded with more than the usual academic plea for more money. “Alzheimer’s disease,” said Takaomi Saido, “will destroy Japan’s social-welfare mechanisms in the near future.” Saido, based in Wako, Saitama, is on a twin social and scientific mission: to protect Japanese society from the ravages of Alzheimer’s disease, and to uncover the secrets of how the brain ages. It’s interesting that he emphasizes that his mission is about protecting society. Alzheimer’s is already one of the most expensive diseases in developed countries. In the United States, it costs more than $100 billion a year. Saido is only too aware of how this will increase. “My social mission is to protect social-welfare mechanisms,” he told me, “because the socioeconomical cost of Alzheimer’s disease will be greater than the government’s annual income by 2050 unless the disease becomes preventable.” That sounds like a lot of money. But the estimate for the financial burden caused by Alzheimer’s in Japan by 2050 is $500 billion a year, which is about the same as the government’s annual revenues. Why is the cost going to increase so much? “People will be receiving much less pension after retirement and paying more taxes and hospital costs,” Saido said. So the government should invest now to save in the future. If we can find a way to treat or prevent Alzheimer’s, the number of people who suffer from dementia and the burden on caregivers will be smaller. “Alzheimer’s research is much more cost-effective than any other research field, including stem-cell research,” Saido assured me. As an example, Saido offered his new mice. Years in the making, these are no ordinary mice. The Riken team thinks it may revolutionize research into Alzheimer’s, and this is the scientific part of Saido’s twin mission. “My scientific mission is to uncover the essence of brain aging, one manifestation of which leads to Alzheimer’s disease development.” Much of the research conducted into Alzheimer’s uses mice as “models” of humans. Scientists use strains of mice that have a genetic propensity to develop Alzheimer’s-like symptoms, and it might go without saying, but mice are not the same as people, and the models are not perfect. In particular, the strain of mouse commonly used in Alzheimer’s research makes too much of a particular protein, known as amyloid precursor protein. This APP leads to the production of amyloid deposits, which are thought to cause the breakdown of neurons in the brain and which are the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. But since the mouse makes too much APP, Saido thinks much of the work done on that mouse strain — and there has been a lot — is flawed, and won’t help our understanding of the disease in humans. The new mouse model is a strain that produces APP and the subsequent amyloid deposits in a way that is more realistic for the actual human disease. The details have just been published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. “The generation of appropriate mouse models will be a major breakthrough for understanding the mechanism of the disease,” said Saido, “which will lead to the establishment of presymptomatic diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the disease.” I asked Saido for any preventative advice. “To my knowledge, the only scientifically proven measure is a daily exercise, like one hour of walking,” he said. Much remains to be discovered about this insidious disease. But there is hope. Two recent papers in the British journal the Lancet show that in the U.K. and Denmark there is a decrease in the number of people getting Alzheimer’s disease. The first paper shows details of two surveys of people with Alzheimer’s in the U.K., one in 1994 and the other in 2014. The researchers expected that the second survey would show more people with Alzheimer’s, since the average age of the population had increased over the intervening 20 years. But the numbers came up some 200,000 short. The evidence suggests that people are developing Alzheimer’s at an increased age. Something appears to be delaying the onset of the disease. (The DOI reference for this paper is 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61570-6.) The Danish study shows that people in their 90s born in 1915 were healthier and smarter — they performed better on cognitive tests — than people in their 90s born in 1905. So something improved in the lifestyle or diet of people born in 1915 that seems to have protected them. (The DOI reference for this paper is 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60777-1.) What are we to make of this? Some might say that it shows, for developed countries at least, that better nutrition, fitness and education may be helping to reduce the reach of Alzheimer’s. Maybe that’s true — but only slightly. “To conquer Alzheimer’s disease, it is essential to establish presymptomatic diagnosis and preventive medicine,” said Saido. He also suggests that the apparent decrease in Alzheimer’s seen in the U.K. may be due to a decrease in the consumption of fish and chips. That’s not as glib as it might seem, as an improved diet could reduce vascular forms of dementia, which would also reduce Alzheimer’s. But even if you doubt that the fabric of society is at risk — or that fish and chips have much to do with it — he’s right that we need to conquer the disease.",

    "source": "America: the superpower ally that's far, far away <eos> Japan is, at heart, politically as well as geographically, a country of small towns. One of these is home to the Japanese-American political relationship. Populated by distinguished elders and ambitious young courtiers from government and academia on both sides of the Pacific, this village has its own lexicon, holds town meetings at think tanks and issues nonbinding resolutions promoting the status quo. To become a permanent resident of the nichibei kankei mura (Japan-U.S. relations village), one must first have the right resume. Like homes, restaurants and gas stations, it’s first about “location, location, location.” That means having an address in either one of America’s two cities (New York or Washington — are there any others?), or in Japan (this merely being a synonym for Tokyo, of course). Thus, it’s not surprising to discover that, compared with Tokyo, serious and informed interest in, and conversation about, the Japan-U.S. relationship in Kansai is somewhat lacking, to be polite. It’s not that people in Kyoto, Osaka, Nara or Kobe like or dislike Americans more than people in Tokyo. Rather, they’re just indifferent because of their location. For most Kansai residents, politically, economically, and in terms of individual relations, America is a distant country indeed. In 2011, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, more than 67 percent of Kansai’s exports went to Asia, with 24 percent sent to China alone. By contrast, just under 11 percent went to the United States. Also almost 57 percent of Kansai’s imports came from Asia, as well one-third from China, as opposed to just under 7 percent from the United States. Less than 8,000 people from North America, including Canada, were registered as living in Kansai’s three main prefectures of Kyoto, Osaka, and Hyogo in 2011. By contrast, Tokyo alone had more than 35,000 North Americans, excluding U.S. service members. At Kansai airport, just how distant America is can easily be grasped. This month, there is one direct daily flight to the U.S. mainland, to San Francisco, from Kansai airport. Another flight to New York, three times weekly, originates in Taiwan. Narita alone flies to 16 U.S. mainland cities daily, in many cases more than once. All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines have given up on Kansai as a North American hub, and with Haneda adding even more U.S.-bound flights, most Kansai travelers going to the United States on these airlines fly out of Itami to one of the two Tokyo airports to catch a connecting flight. All of the above means it’s very hard to get Kansai people strongly interested in discussing the upcoming visit of President Barack Obama, Japan-U.S. politics or the role of the American military, especially since there are no U.S. bases in Kansai. So, people in Kansai think, what is the point in raising such complicated and controversial issues about a country whose people I don’t see? Better to just talk about food, television programs or office gossip. Kansai’s exception to this indifference to politics is arguably Kyoto. After Tokyo, it’s the most popular tourist destination for American tourists, which means opportunities to interact with Americans the rest of Kansai doesn’t have. But those are short-term encounters rather than long-term relationships with people who have personal or professional reasons for being in Japan. The ancient capital is also a draw for academic or cultural specialists who have a distinct lack of interest in anything outside their field of study. Thus, the Japan-U.S. relationship, especially the political aspect, is of less interest than in Tokyo because while everyone understands that it’s important, the small American presence in Kansai means the politics are quite removed from the way people here live their lives. Out of sight, therefore, out of mind. View from Osaka is a monthly column that examines the latest news from a Kansai perspective.",

    "source": "New arms export principles, guidelines are adopted by Abe Cabinet <eos> Japan on Tuesday adopted new principles and guidelines on arms exports, the first major overhaul in nearly half a century of its arms embargo policy, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe set the stage for the country to play a more active role in global security. Despite concern that the new policy change will hurt the country’s status as a pacifist state, the Cabinet approved the rules that update the so-called “three principles” on restricting arms exports in the Cold War era, and give more clarity and leeway to the country’s weapons export policy. The newly adopted three principles on the transfer of defense equipment state that Japan will continue to embrace the basic philosophy of a pacifist state that abides by the U.N. Charter. Under the new principles, Japan will prohibit the export of weapons to countries involved in conflicts. The ban will also apply when exports violate U.N. resolutions. Japan will allow arms exports only if they serve the purpose of contributing to international cooperation and its security interests. Even when exports are allowed, Japan plans to impose strict screenings and make the process transparent. The unstated use and transfer of Japanese equipment to third parties will also be kept in check. Abe is reworking the country’s defense and security policy to deal with new security threats, and the new guidelines are one of his major policy goals. He is expected to decide whether to reinterpret the war-renouncing Constitution to enable Japan to exercise the right to collective self-defense and defend an ally under armed attack, namely the United States. Before Tuesday’s approval, the ruling coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party and the New Komeito party called on the government to ensure Japan would not help countries involved in conflicts, and would disclose information on arms export deals to the public. Opinion polls have indicated the public in Japan is unsure about the decades-old guidelines being changed, fearing a lack of clear limits on arms exports could undermine the pacifist stance. Under the new scheme, the defense, foreign and trade ministries will normally conduct screenings. The National Security Council, a body launched in December to speed up decision-making on defense and foreign policy, will decide whether to allow exports when deals are considered important and require caution. The government will publish annual reports on defense equipment approved by the ministries for exports, and also disclose information on deals discussed by the NSC. Adopted in 1967, and turned into a virtual blanket ban in 1976, the “three principles” on arms exports have turned into a symbol of the country’s pacifist stance. As the security environment has changed since the end of the Cold War, there have been calls for Japan to review its arms embargo policy rather than making “exceptions” to the rules. Japan has long banned the transfer of weapons to communist states, countries subject to embargoes under U.N. resolutions and those involved in international conflicts. In 2011, Japan relaxed the rules to allow exports for humanitarian and peaceful purposes, and to make it easier to participate in the joint development and production of weapons.",

    "source": "Ruling puts whaling in doubt <eos> THE HAGUE - The future of Japan’s whaling was thrown into doubt after the International Court of Justice ruled Monday that the nation’s annual hunt in the Antarctic was not really for scientific purposes — as Tokyo had claimed — and ordered it halted. The ruling was a major victory for whaling opponents, as it ends for now one of the world’s biggest whale hunts, for minkes in the icy Southern Ocean. The judgment was praised by Australia, which brought the case against Japan in 2010, and by environmentalists, who have been seeking an end to whaling since the 1970s on ethical grounds. The world court’s decision leaves Japan with a tough choice between ending whaling outright — despite past claims that it would never abandon such a deep-seated cultural practice — or redesigning its program to make it a scientific endeavor after all. Japan has previously all but ruled out joining Norway and Iceland in openly flouting the international consensus against commercial whaling. Australia’s former environment minister, Peter Garrett, who oversaw the suit’s launch, said he felt vindicated. “I’m absolutely over the moon, for all those people who wanted to see the charade of scientific whaling cease once and for all,” Garrett told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. “I think (this) means without any shadow of a doubt that we won’t see the taking of whales in the Southern Ocean in the name of science.” In a 12-4 majority judgment, the U.N. court sided with Australia, finding that Japan’s program fell short of following scientific methods. For instance, judges said Japan had given no reason for its target of 850 minke whales annually and often failed to meet the target. It gave no defense of why it needed to kill that many to study them. And the “research” program had produced just two peer-reviewed scientific papers since 2005. “The court concludes that the special permits granted by Japan for the killing, taking, and treating of whales . . . are not ‘for purposes of scientific research,’ ” presiding Judge Peter Tomka said. The court ordered Japan to grant no further permits for its current Antarctic program. Japan had argued its study was aimed at determining whether commercial hunting could be conducted on a sustainable basis. The International Court of Justice is the U.N.’s court for resolving disputes between nations and its rulings are binding and not subject to appeal. Although sovereign countries can and occasionally do ignore them, both Japan and Australia had pledged to abide by this decision. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Monday the government will keep its word and obey the court “as a state that places a great importance on the international legal order.” However, he criticized the International Whaling Commission, the main international body that regulates whaling, which ordered a moratorium on all commercial whaling in 1986. That moratorium has remained in place despite recommendations from its own scientific committee that some whale species are robust enough to support a whaling industry. Suga said Japan has cooperated with the IWC for decades “despite the deep divisions within the commission, and its inability in recent years to function effectively.” He left the question of what Japan will do next unanswered. But the daily Asahi Shimbun reported Tuesday that Japan could try to rescue its Antarctic whaling program by sharply reducing catch quotas under a revamped “scientific whaling” program. The outlook is tough, however, with more than half of the IWC members now opposed to whaling, the daily said. Membership in the IWC is voluntary and Norway and Iceland have simply decided to ignore its mandates while remaining members. Under IWC rules, countries are allowed to issue themselves as many permits as they see fit to kill whales for scientific purposes. The permits are subject to a nonbinding review by a 200-member scientific committee that has been critical of Japan for many of the same reasons outlined by the world court’s ruling. Norway hunts around 500 minke whales in the Northeast Atlantic each year, while Iceland hunts roughly 50. Japan has a second scientific program in the North Pacific that culls around 100 minke whales annually. That program may now also be open to challenge because it was not covered in the Australian suit. Activist Pete Bethune, a New Zealander who has clashed frequently with Japanese whalers in attempts to stop their hunt, said, “justice was served” by Monday’s ruling. “The court dissected their scientific program, pulled it to bits and it proved that the amount of science is tiny relative to the commercial aspects,” he said outside the courtroom. The ruling left the door open for Japan to launch a new scientific hunt, though any new program would face intense scrutiny and would presumably need to be better designed. Judges said explicitly there was nothing in international law that forbids killing whales as part of a scientific study. It also noted that whales culled for scientific purposes may be slaughtered and sold — although that could not be the primary purpose of a scientific study. Consumption of whale meat has declined in popularity in Japan in recent years but it is still considered a delicacy by some. Most of the whale meat from Japanese hunts ends up being sold. Mitsumasa Kamiota, an official with the Fisheries Agency, underlined that Japan has not said it will quit research whaling altogether. He said Monday’s ruling only affects the country’s Antarctic program, and whaling in the North Pacific will continue. Kamiota also hinted that Japan may eventually come up with a new research program in the Antarctic. He said Japan does not intend to withdraw from the International Whaling Commission. “There is no change to our commitment to continue scientific research whaling under the international rules,” he said. “We will carefully examine what is allowed and what is not allowed under the ruling.” Japan had argued that Australia’s suit was an attempt to force its cultural norms on Japan, saying it was equivalent to Hindus demanding an international ban on killing cows.",

    "source": "Declining appetites are bigger threat to whaling <eos> The greatest threat to Japan’s whaling industry may not be the environmentalists harassing its ships or the countries demanding its abolishment, but consumers who have lost their appetite for the delicacy. The amount of whale meat stockpiled for lack of buyers has nearly doubled over the last decade, even as anti-whaling protests helped drive catches to record lows. Meat equivalent to more than 2,300 minke whales is sitting in freezers while whalers still plan to catch another 1,300 per year. Low demand will unlikely recover given Monday’s ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague that Japan should stop its research whaling in the Antarctic Ocean because it isn’t really for scientific purposes. The ruling was a major victory for whaling opponents such as Australia, which argued that it is a cover for commercial hunts. The stated goal of the research, which began in 1987, is to show that commercial whaling is environmentally sustainable, but a growing question is whether it is economically sustainable. The government-subsidized whaling program is sinking deeper into debt and faces an imminent, costly renovation of its 27-year-old mother ship, the Nisshin Maru. “A resumption of commercial whaling is not a realistic option anymore, and the goal has become a mere excuse to continue research hunts,” said Ayako Okubo, a marine science researcher at Tokai University. “The program is used for the vested interests.” The research program began a year after an international ban on commercial hunting took effect. Japan is one of a handful of countries, including Norway and Iceland, that continue to hunt whales despite the moratorium. Activists from the Sea Shepherd group try to block the whalers by dragging ropes in the water to damage their propellers, lobbing smoke bombs at the ships and other methods. Whale meat not used for study is sold as food in Japan. But according to Fisheries Agency statistics, the amount of whale meat stockpiled in freezers at major ports around the country totaled about 4,600 tons at the end of 2012, from less than 2,500 tons in 2002. A Fisheries Agency official conceded that Sea Shepherd’s efforts to harass whaling ships have kept the stockpile from growing even bigger. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Whale meat supplied half of protein needs for Japanese people 50 years ago, but today it is limited in most of the country to specialty restaurants and school lunches. It is a bigger part of the local diet in several coastal whaling towns that are allowed to conduct small-scale coastal whaling outside of International Whaling Commission oversight. The number of whale meat distributors and processors declined by half between 1999 and 2012, according to industry statistics. Distributors have said whale meat is unpopular largely because of the high price it commands, a lack of recipe varieties and negative image. Once a cheaper substitute for beef, it’s now about the same price. Whale bacon is sold as a delicacy, priced at about ¥2,000 per 100 grams, several times the cost of regular bacon. The Institute of Cetacean Research, a nonprofit entity overseen by the government that runs the program, made ¥2 billion from sales of whale meat last year, down from more than ¥7 billion in 2004, according to a financial report viewed by The Associated Press. The institute rejected repeated requests for comment on whaling and its future, citing concerns about possible repercussions and violence by Sea Shepherd environmentalists on Japanese whalers. The five-ship fleet is expected to return home within weeks, though the institute did not give any details. Its website is filled with press releases related to Sea Shepherd instead of its research. Initially, the government injected about ¥500 million a year into the program, or about 10 percent of its costs. By 2007, the subsidy had grown to about ¥900 million, and is projected to exceed ¥5 billion for the current fiscal year ending in September. That includes money for anti-Sea Shepherd measures, such as repairs for damage and dispatch of a patrol ship. In 2011, the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry used an earthquake and tsunami disaster reconstruction fund to help cover whaling debts. The ministry later acknowledged funneling ¥2.3 billion of the fund into whaling, triggering a public outcry. The whaling subsidy, now part of a broader package of fisheries issues, will expire next year. Okubo, the marine researcher, says the research has been a comfortable option for Japan to keep the embattled industry alive without taking drastic restructuring needed if they are serious about going commercial again. The research has justified subsidies, kept jobs for whalers and allowed Japan to catch up to the ambitious catch quota. The industry at its peak in the 1960s had more than 10,000 crew members and fishermen, but that number has dropped to fewer than 200, plus a small number of coastal whalers. The only commercial whaling operator still in business in Japan is Kyodo Sempaku Kaisha, which is affiliated with the Institute of Cetacean Research and manages whaling ships and meat sales. Monday’s ruling in The Hague could cost Japan the roughly 1,000 whales it takes in the Antarctic each year, or its catch quota could be reduced. Other Japanese whaling programs in the North Pacific and off the coast of Japan will not be affected. Masayuki Komatsu, a former Fisheries Agency official who served as a negotiator at International Whaling Commission annual meetings, says Antarctic whaling is legal under international rules. “What’s at stake is not just whales. It’s a matter of territorial rights, in a way,” said Komatsu, now a fisheries professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies. “The Antarctic is an open sea that everyone is entitled to its rich resources. There is no need to concede to nationalistic confrontation.” But a 2011 report by a Fisheries Agency panel of outside experts recommended scaling back or terminating the Antarctic hunts, suggesting that coastal whaling could be enough for Japan’s tiny appetite for whale meat. It was supposed to be an interim report, but no final report was ever published.",

At least 11,000 people have already been made homeless by wildfires that sent burning embers flying from hilltop to hilltop. A 15th body has also been discovered, while the toll of destroyed homes has risen to more than 2,500. As smoke rose from smoldering ruins all over the picturesque coastal city, many compared the scene to Dante’s “Inferno.” Some people made their way home after days without sleep, only to discover ruins. The fires — so hot they created their own fierce winds — consumed a few entire neighborhoods. In other districts, some houses stood unscathed but remained in danger from glowing embers carried by the shifting winds. “We are looking at the largest air operation ever assembled against a fire like this,” Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said. She said the blazes had grown to “dimensions never before seen.” Chile’s forestry agency predicted it would take three weeks to completely stamp out the fires, which began Saturday in a forested ravine and quickly spread into ramshackle housing on one of Valparaiso’s 42 hills. Hot dry winds blowing out to sea whipped embers onto other neighborhoods on six densely populated hills where people live in poorly constructed homes without municipal water or sewer connections, fire hydrants or streets wide enough for emergency vehicles. As of Monday, there appeared to be no end in sight. Helicopters were flying without pause, dumping water on hot spots. Aid was flowing in from all over Chile to Valparaiso, where evacuees crowded into eight shelters. Hundreds of young volunteers climbed hills carrying bottles of water and shovels to help victims search the ruins of their homes. “We’re going to rebuild right here. Where else would we go?” said Carolina Ovando, 22, who lost the humble home she kept with three small children. Schools were closed, some of them damaged by fires and others jammed with evacuees. Navy officer Julio Leiva said Monday that the death toll had risen to 15, with most of the bodies too badly burned to identify without DNA tests, according to the national forensics service. More than 500 people were also being treated at hospitals, mostly for smoke inhalation. Bachelet coordinated the emergency response with her Cabinet, canceling a trip to Argentina and Uruguay. She asked Chile’s neighbors for backup in case of other fires, freeing Chilean planes and helicopters to join the fleet in Valparaiso. Argentine Foreign Minister Hector Timerman promised to collaborate with rescue teams and water-dumping planes. From the Vatican, Pope Francis sent a message sharing his prayers. Bachelet put the entire city under military rule, and 5,000 firefighters, police, forest rangers, soldiers, sailors and civil defense workers joined the response. Cars were banned from streets leading up eight of the Valparaiso’s hills so emergency vehicles could get through. Valparaiso is an oceanside city of 250,000 people surrounded by hills that form a natural amphitheater. The compact downtown includes Chile’s congress and its second-largest port, and the city owes its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site to the colorful homes built on slopes so steep that many people commute using stairs and cable cars. But what’s beautiful on postcards can be dangerous for those who live there: Many people have built on land not fit for housing. “We are too vulnerable as a city. We have been the builders and architects of our own danger,” Valparaiso Mayor Jorge Castro said Sunday in an interview with Chile’s 24H channel.",

    "source": "Government plans to resume 'research whaling' in 2015 <eos> LOS ANGELES - The nation’s Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR) has filed briefs in the U.S. District Court in Seattle stating its intent to resume whale hunting in the Southern Ocean as early as fiscal 2015. The move, made Friday, immediately faced strong opposition from conservation group Sea Shepherd as it came less than two weeks after the International Court of Justice ordered Japan on March 31 to halt its so-called research whaling. The government plans to resume whale hunting as soon as the fiscal year starting April 2015 by tweaking parts of its research program, including reducing the number of whales taken. The ICR has said that the new program will not run counter to the ICJ ruling. The ICR and Sea Shepherd have been locked in a legal dispute in the United States, with the institute seeking an end to the anti-whaling group’s interference in its hunt. “The statement that Japan issued that they would comply with the ICJ ruling was I believe insincere,” Sea Shepherd founder Paul Watson said. “Japan has a history of duplicity with regard to whaling. I fully expect that Sea Shepherd Global will be prepared to return to the Southern Ocean in December 2015 to once again defend the integrity of the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary,” Watson said.",

Even more perplexing is that I recently I saw a pile of them inland, in a peaceful canal in Tokyo where I can’t imagine waves are an issue. So, why the heck are they there? Galen S., Tokyo Dear Galen, Let’s start with the first part of your question. Those crazy jack-like structures are called tetrapods, from the Greek meaning “four-legged.” “Tetrapod” is actually a trade name registered to Fudo Tetra Corporation, a major supplier, but people tend to use the term generically. The proper generic nomenclature, for readers who like to know that kind of thing, is shōha block (wave-dissipation block) in Japanese and armor unit in English. Armor units are used all over the world — not just in Japan — to protect man-made constructions that get in the way of moving water, such as seawalls, breakwaters and land-reclamation projects like Kansai International Airport, which was built completely out in the water. Whether placed only on the open-sea side of a construction or all around it, armor units break the force of incoming waves and redirect the water so it doesn’t crash full-force against the construction. Tetrapods work particularly well as armor units because when arranged in lines or heaps, the legs lock together to create a stable, porous barrier that holds up well under even extreme conditions. To find out more, I paid a visit to Fudo Tetra’s Tokyo office, where public relations manager Takatoshi Matsubuchi explained that the tetrapod was invented in France in 1949. Up until then, coastal engineers typically used piles of stones or rubble to protect marine constructions, but the problem with that method is that loose pieces are easily scattered or washed away. The advantages of the tetrapod were obvious, particularly in Japan, which had 33,000 km of coast and more than 4,000 harbors and fishing ports to protect. In fact, Japanese engineers were so excited about the tetrapod that they didn’t wait for such niceties as contracts or licensing agreements. A patent dispute ensued and the Japanese government, eager to protect the country from kaigan shinshoku (coastal erosion), helped broker a swift settlement. In the following decades, and especially during Japan’s period of high economic growth, tetrapods and other concrete armor units were widely adopted. If you look up tetrapods online, you’ll see the widely repeated assertion that a full half of the coastline of Japan has been artificially altered with cement constructions. That’s a pretty shocking claim if true, but unfortunately none of the sites posting it provided a source. I did search for primary data but did not turn up statistics that could support or dispute it. But it’s safe to say that tetrapods are a common sight near the water in Japan and that supplying them is big business. You were right to wonder how tetrapods are transported. I looked up the specs, and even a small tetrapod weighs nearly half a ton, while the big boys can top 80 tons. This is obviously not the sort of product that can be shipped around the country. So what happens is that companies such as Fudo Tetra lease steel molds to local contractors which pour the concrete on-site where the tetrapods are to be used. Even the molds are huge — far too big to be transported intact on Japan’s narrow roads — so they are delivered in pieces and assembled before the pouring work begins. When the cement is dry, the molds are removed and the tetrapods are lifted into place with cranes. Matsubuchi couldn’t speak specifically about your inland tetrapods, so I set off to find out who manages the canal where you saw them. You couldn’t remember the exact location but the photograph you sent contained a critical clue: a bridge with visible writing. As loyal readers know (because this was the subject of a “What the Heck” in May 2011), all bridges in Japan have names. Using the bridge name, I was able to pinpoint the location to the Takahama Canal, which is managed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s Bureau of Sewerage. A spokesman explained that treated water is released into the canal at regular periods. The tetrapods were placed near the release points to lessen the impact of waves on small boats. Tetrapods surfaced on television last year, making an appearance during the theme-song opening of NHK’s hit morning drama “Ama-chan.” The tetrapod shots were taken at the Kosode fishing port in Kuji, Iwate Prefecture, a location used throughout the show. When you consider that the theme-song footage aired six mornings a week from April until September, on a show that enjoyed over 20 percent national viewership, that’s the sort of exposure marketers would kill for. But Matsubuchi said it didn’t have a big impact on business. “We are of course very pleased that tetrapods were featured so prominently on such a popular show,” he told me. “And the city of Kuji did order more tetrapods to repair the damage sustained during the 2011 tsunami. But it’s not like the average television viewer buys tetrapods.” True, but there are a surprising number of people who think tetrapods are oddly beautiful, and other companies that can cater to their tastes. A company called Maniapparel, for example, makes T-shirts and sweatshirts with tetrapod designs, as well as grey felt stuffed-toy versions to strew around your sofa to bolster you from the shock waves of life.",

The augury of fine weather that was afforded by the afternoon’s sunshine was belied by a slight rainfall at night. At about six o’clock the searchlights began to play on the Yoyogi parade ground, which was also surrounded by electric illuminations; while the large black and white paper lanterns appropriate to such occasions, bearing the imperial crest, were freely interspersed. Ambassadors and Ministers began to arrive at half past seven, in Imperial Household carriages with military escorts. Their Imperial Majesties arrived at 8:40, and at once retired to the rest-rooms behind the Imperial pavilion. A bugle fanfare at 9:25 announced the approach of the funeral cortege. Their Imperial Majesties met the procession at the second torii (gate). The coffin being deposited in the center of the Sanctuary, in the pavilion especially erected, the curtain was withdrawn, revealing a blaze of light. The Ritualists made the traditional offerings, the Chief Ritualist reading the appointed address. His Imperial Majesty (Yoshihito, now known as Taisho) then paid homage, and read an address as follows: “I, Yoshihito, reverently address the Spirit of the late Emperor-Mother. Only a year and a half has elapsed since the conclusion of the national mourning for His Majesty the late Emperor, and our tears are barely dry when, alas, We again suffer a great loss. How unpitying, alas, is Heaven to Yoshihito! We have in person performed ceremonies while Her Late Majesty lay in state, sanctified, in a temporary shrine for several days past; and we are now about to lay the August Remains beside those of the late Imperial Father. We have now come to say farewell. Alas! At this moment Our sorrow is unbelievable.” 75 YEARS AGO Saturday, May 13, 1939 Political activities in Shanghai banned The following joint proclamation was issued this afternoon by the French Concession and the Shanghai Municipal Council, stressing their neutrality and banning associations of political nature: “From the beginning of the hostilities (between China and Japan), the authorities of the French Concession and the International Settlement have striven continuously to preserve their neutrality in the areas under their control so that the law-abiding residents may continue with security to carry on their lawful occupations and that the safety of life and property might be preserved for all persons irrespective of their nationality. “The activities of political nature, though they may be regarded by those participating as being of patriotic character, cannot legitimately be carried on in the neutral areas. Associations of a political nature accordingly cannot be allowed to operate in the areas under the control of the authorities of the French Concession and the International Settlement. Such activities would, in the opinion of the authorities concerned, be inconsistent with absolute neutrality which, it is their common object to preserve. It is accordingly, hereby, proclaimed that any person participating in activities of such association either directly or indirectly may be denied the sanctuary of the concession and the settlement and be liable to expulsion.” Shanghai had fallen under Japanese control in 1937 after the Battle of Shanghai. 50 YEARS AGO Sunday, May 3, 1964 Goodwill on show in buildup to Olympics At 10 a.m. Saturday, a small but important signboard was added to Tokyo’s jungle of glaring signs. The new sign, put up in front of 22 department stores of the Japanese capital shows three initials, IGS, which stand for International Goodwill Shop. It symbolizes a campaign to give a good and lasting impression to visitors from abroad to the Tokyo Olympic Games. The drive, initiated by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is symbolic of the current nationwide movement to enhance the international reputation of Japan at the grass-roots level by making the Olympic visitors’ stay in Japan comfortable. The IGS signs will be distributed to all retail shops, restaurants, coffee shops, bars, hotels, barbers and beauty shops and laundries which meet the required standard. The standard differs according to the business establishment. Common to all are that prices must be written in Arabic figures, the shop must be sanitary and no undue price increase is to be practiced to take advantage of temporary visitors. A spokesman for the chamber said that the chamber hoped to have some 2,000 IGS shops in Tokyo and about 3,000 more elsewhere in Japan. 25 YEARS AGO Tuesday, May 2, 1989 Tokyo land sale hands trader top earnings title Abdel Hadi Debs, a Lebanese national, topped the tax agency’s list of income earners in Japan last year after selling a tract of land in Tokyo. Debs, 70, a trading company representative in Japan, earned an estimated ¥43 billion after selling an 8,600-sq.-meter plot of land in Oyama, Shibuya Ward, an official of the National Tax Administration Agency said Monday. Debs paid ¥6.854 billion in tax, Japan’s all-time record for income tax paid by an individual. Debs was followed in the list of biggest taxpayers by Mitsuo Akiyama, 51, owner of a gasoline station in Fukuzawa, Setagaya Ward, Tokyo. Akiyama sold a 4,000-sq.-meter plot of land in Tokyo for about ¥12 billion and paid about ¥3.358 billion in tax. Mitsuo Sakaguchi, 60, was ranked third. He sold a 900-sq.-meter plot of land in Tokyo’s Shinjuku Ward for about ¥9 billion.",

    "source": "Fashionable Shibuya is a magnet for youths <eos> Known as the town for young people, Tokyo’s Shibuya district is the capital’s center of youth fashion and culture. It also attracts crowds of tourists from home and abroad. Shibuya is best known for its “scramble crossing” near the north exit of JR Shibuya Station, where as many as 3,000 pedestrians coming from mainly four different directions calmly dodge each other in the large intersection when the crossing lights turn green. Around 500,000 people cross the intersection every day. Nearby stands the statue of Hachiko, the faithful dog praised for its loyalty to its master. The plaza around the statue is a popular meeting point and photo spot for tourists. Last year, a tourist information booth was set up near the statue to dispense information on the area’s shops and restaurants, including the famous Shibuya 109 fashion complex. Shibuya literally means “Shibu valley,” suggesting it was once low-lying land. Indeed, Shibuya Station stands where the Shibuya and Uda rivers formerly converged. However, due to urban development, the landscape has changed significantly in recent decades. Tokyu railway led Shibuya’s postwar development, opening Tokyu Department Store and other key facilities in the 1950s. Then, in the 1970s, Seibu railway established a foothold with its own department store and the Parco fashion complex, bringing a fresh vibe to the town. Those who see Shibuya merely as the center of youth fashion and culture may be surprised if they venture into Nonbei Yokocho, an alley lined with small “izakaya” (pubs) and yakitori eateries beside the JR Yamanote Line. Most of the bars are so small they only hold four to six people, and the seats are usually taken by those seeking a break from the hustle and bustle of the streets. People visiting the alley often feel nostalgic for the Showa Period. But the redevelopment of Shibuya never stops. In 2008, Tokyo Metro’s Fukutoshin Line reached Shibuya, and the 2012 opening of the Shibuya Hikarie commercial complex linked the Tokyu Toyoko Line with the Fukutoshin, making the already busy hub station even larger. Next on the horizon is the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. A 230-meter-tall hotel is scheduled to open in time for the event, and a major office complex is to be built by 2027.",

    "source": "Australian billionaire Packer in Bondi Beach street brawl with longtime friend <eos> SYDNEY - Billionaire Australian gaming mogul James Packer was seen brawling on a Bondi Beach street with a fellow businessman, David Gyngell, a lifelong friend, former best man and chief executive of the Nine Entertainment Group, media reported on Monday. At least 50 photos of Packer, owner of Australia’s Crown Resorts Ltd., and Gyngell viciously fighting outside Packer’s home on Sunday are circulating for sale, the Sydney Morning Herald said. Packer and Gyngell released a joint statement on Monday, which did not confirm the fight, but said they remained friends. A Facebook page purportedly belonging to a neighbor of Packer’s, whose name is given as Chris Walker, provided an unconfirmed but detailed report of the fight. Walker did not respond to attempts by Reuters to verify his posting. “Holy crap, big street fight outside my house … Not thugs, James Packer … And some other angry bloke going toe to toe — total brawl .. Wow,” he wrote on the social networking site. “Packer packed a punch but copped a couple of hits straight to the jaw… Then they all fell on the concrete fence and I think the other guy broke his face … They were looking for teeth after he left.” Packer is one of Australia’s richest men, with Forbes recently estimating his net worth at $6.4 billion, and he has aggressively sought to expand his casino business into Asia and the United States. “We have been friends for 35 years and still are,” Gyngell and Packer said in a joint statement released by Nine Entertainment and Crown. “In that time we have had our fair share of ups and downs. We respect each other and neither of us will be commenting further.” Nine Entertainment Co. Holdings is the owner of Australia’s Nine TV network, one of the nation’s largest broadcasters. Packer has a stake in rival Ten Network Holdings, although the fight was not believed to be connected to their entertainment holdings. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that 50 photos exist showing the two men squaring off, pulling at each other’s shirts and grappling before falling and wrestling on the ground before other men, possibly Packer’s bodyguards, intervened. The newspaper said that the pair’s long-term friendship had soured after Gyngell tried to intervene on behalf of Packer’s second wife, Erica, from whom he announced his separation around six months ago.",

    "source": "Icho's ethnic vitality poses future model for Japan <eos> If Japan throws its doors open to immigrants it might start looking like a certain neighborhood in Yokohama with multilingual street signs, ethnic eateries, and a babel of languages spoken in the streets. At the heart of this unconventional neighborhood is the so-called Icho housing complex less than 1 km east of Koza Shibuya Station on the Odakyu Enoshima Line. Roughly 20 percent of the 3,500 or so households here have foreign backgrounds, many having arrived in the past few decades from Vietnam, China and Cambodia. “One good thing about this area is that people are ethnically very diverse. Here, it’s normal for you to be different from others,” said Hoang Ha Nguyen Phan, a 28-year-old Vietnamese who came to Japan with her family in 1995 to seek political asylum. Experts say the neighborhood epitomizes the idea of interculturalism, which could be essential to Japan’s survival as an economic power at a time when its birthrate and labor force are in decline. The Icho complex, run by the Kanagawa Prefectural Government, became a magnet for foreigners after the establishment in 1980 of a reception center in the neighborhood for refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Many decided to live in the complex because of its proximity to the reception center, which closed in 1997. Other residents include factory workers from Brazil and Japanese orphans who were left behind in China after World War II and began to be repatriated in the 1980s. The Cabinet Office in February released figures projecting that Japan’s population of 120 million will fall to 87 million by 2060, and to 43 million by 2110. “The biggest problem we have around here is that residents, especially the Japanese ones, are getting older and older,” said Hideki Hayakawa, who runs a volunteer organization that helps local foreign residents with daily tasks. Hayakawa said that while foreigners continue to move into the Icho complex, Japanese tend to balk at the tiny apartments and inconvenient location. As a result, there is an odd demographic gap: The Japanese residents are graying and the foreigners are providing the dynamism. “A neighborhood faces a crisis if there are few kids. So I believe foreign families with children will play an important role in keeping this area alive,” Hayakawa said. Hayakawa’s group, Tabunka Machizukuri Kobo, or Studio to Create a Multicultural Neighborhood, organizes Japanese lessons, arranges interpreters for a nominal fee and runs errands for foreigners who don’t understand Japanese well. He set up the group in 2000. Hayakawa has watched the complex’s fortunes evolve for longer than that. He said there were problems in the 1990s, when some Japanese residents came to resent the rapid influx of foreigners. Some complained that the newcomers ignored rules on taking out the garbage, for example, or that they would disturb the block with karaoke bouts late at night. In 1999, the frustrations resulted in some Japanese petitioning the Kanagawa government to bar more foreigners from moving in. But their animosity subsided in time, thanks to the immigrants’ own children. Raised in Japanese schools, when the youngsters grew up they taught their parents how to go local. More than a decade later, the neighborhood could be facing yet another crossroads. In April, the nearby Icho Elementary School, where many immigrants used to send their children, merged with the neighboring Iida-kita School because the Icho school had suffered a decline in enrollment. At its peak, it boasted a staggering 75 percent of pupils with foreign roots. The merged and rebranded Iida-kita Icho School now has equal numbers of foreign and Japanese pupils, said Satoshi Kikuchi, a teacher in charge of intercultural education. But not everyone is happy. Kikuchi said some Japanese parents from the Iida-kita school are worried that foreign children from the Icho school might be disruptive and force staff to pay them more attention than the Japanese pupils. “We can’t give those foreign children the same amount of attention that the teachers at the old Icho school did,” Kikuchi said. “For now, we are focusing on educating both kids and parents on the need for interculturalism and asking for their understanding.” One way the school may do this is by asking politicians or immigration experts to speak to parents about the values foreign residents bring to the community, and to explain that without them Japan will no longer be able to function as a strong economy, Kikuchi said. “We’re no longer doing foreigners a favor by accepting them. We’re living in an age when we rely on them to maintain our economy,” he said. The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, it appears, shares Kikuchi’s view — at least partially. Last month, it announced it will expand the controversial foreign trainee program by granting participants longer stays, extending their visa terms from three to five years. Although Japan rejects unskilled laborers from abroad under current government policy, unscrupulous employers often exploit the trainees as cheap labor. The program is being extended to lure more foreigners to bolster Japan’s shrinking workforce at a time when the nation is gearing up to build new facilities and infrastructure for the 2020 Olympics. But speaking on television in April, Abe denied that Japan would ease its immigration policies soon, saying foreign countries have found that it causes friction with local residents. Open-door policies have led to “many unfortunate incidents,” he said. Abe conceded, however, that there is a need for more foreigner workers to meet strong demand for labor in the construction industry. Keizo Yamawaki, a professor at Meiji University who specializes in immigration policy, said that while he himself is not opposed to expanding immigration, Abe’s plan to admit more foreigners merely to meet a labor shortage is shortsighted. He said it is almost inevitable, judging from Europe’s experience with so-called guest workers, that some trainees will end up staying in Japan semi-permanently by overstaying their visas or that some may marry Japanese citizens and automatically acquire the right to stay. Therefore, he said, Abe may be opening the door to immigration anyway. “Japan’s shrinking population is a problem that will persist even after 2020. In fact, the pace of the population decline will only accelerate. So admitting foreigners merely as a temporary, stopgap labor force misses the point,” he said.",

    "source": "Abe moves to boost control of bureaucrats <eos> The government formally decided Tuesday to launch the Cabinet Bureau of Personnel Affairs on Friday and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato will serve as its director general, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. The creation of the new bureau and the appointment of Kato, one of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s the closest aides, is seen as another political maneuver by Abe to tighten his grip on powerful government bureaucrats. The bureau will serve as the secretariat for the prime minister to decide the appointments of about 600 elite bureaucrats at ministries and agencies of the central government, including vice ministers and bureau chiefs. Under the current system, the prime minister and chief Cabinet secretary have overseen appointments of about 200 elite bureaucrats. The new personnel bureau will greatly expand the clout of politicians in power. “We’d like to establish a system to cope with various issues quickly and in a united manner” through “strategic appointments of personnel,” Suga told a news conference. Suga announced that Tomomi Inada, now minister in charge of administrative reforms, will also oversee the bureau. But Abe and Suga himself will be directly in charge of screening and appointing those senior bureaucrats, while Inada will oversee other aspects of the bureau’s work, Suga said. Since Abe’s inauguration in December 2012, the prime minister and Suga have interfered in the appointments of a number of key elite officials to strengthen their power base, while past Cabinets have largely avoided doing that to maintain political neutrality over the autonomy of the powerful bureaucratic system. For example, last August Abe tapped Ichiro Komatsu, a former Foreign Ministry official, as director general of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, to push for his drive to reinterpret the war-renouncing Constitution to allow Japan to exercise the right of collective self-defense. Under the long-held government custom, a senior official of the bureau has been promoted to the director general’s post, but Abe broke this tacit arrangement to push for his ambition to change the interpretation of the Constitution. Then, last fall, Abe appointed four right-leaning people whose political interests are close to his to the 12-member board of governors of NHK, the country’s influential public broadcasting organization. The four then helped appoint Katsuto Momii as NHK’s new chairman, who later caused a big stir by saying he will not challenge government policies as far as territorial issues are concerned and by defending Japan’s wartime “comfort women” brothel system. Suga, a former internal affairs minister and Abe’s right-hand man, is known for his keen interest in controlling bureaucrats by meddling in personnel affairs. In June last year, Suga forced Atsuo Saka, a former top Finance Ministry official, to step down as president and CEO of Japan Post Holdings Co. Suga’s move was seen as his drive to strengthen his control over the giant government-owned Japan Post conglomerate.",

The municipal government has been prompting businesses in the city to attain the status of “Japan’s first Muslim-friendly facility” in a variety of fields. In January, Japan’s first halal-certified food-processing facility opened in the Makuhari area in central Chiba. The operator, Sato Chohachi-Shoji Co., a Tokyo-based food trading firm, said the plant is working on research and development, with commercial production to begin in July. A few hundred meters away, the private Kanda University of International Studies opened a Muslim-friendly cafeteria earlier this month as the first of its kind among Japanese colleges, while retail giant Aeon Co.’s new flagship mall, which opened last December at a nearby site, has a prayer room for Muslim shoppers — the first such facility in its domestic network of 135 outlets. The efforts by the private sector follow last September’s relocation of the headquarters of the certifying organization Nippon Asia Halal Association from Tokyo to the city. The Chiba Municipal Government in November invited a representative from the nonprofit group to participate in a city committee on inbound tourism, where members agreed to designate travelers from Asia and Muslims as top promotion targets. The Muslim-friendly initiative was proposed by Mayor Toshihito Kumagai in line with the city’s efforts to host more international conventions at its huge Makuhari Messe convention complex. A spokesman for Sato Chohachi-Shoji said the company will promote its Chiba-made halal products to enter the Middle East and Southeast Asia markets after expanding business with Japanese hotels that accommodate Muslim tourists. “We would like to promote ‘Made in Japan’ as a brand in the global halal market,” he added.",

    "source": "Alien invasion threatening native species <eos> An invasion has been going on under our noses. It is multipronged, ruthless and very difficult to repel. It has been called an “ecological apocalypse.” If you look out your window you may be able to see evidence of it. That pigeon flying past? An invader. Likewise, the cat by the garbage. Most are so familiar we don’t even think of them as invaders, but they are not native to Japan. There are many more, and most are far less obvious. “Non-native invasive species have been popularly described as one of the four horsemen of the ecological apocalypse,” says Nisha Owen, a conservation biologist at the Zoological Society of London. “They are a real and pressing danger to biodiversity and ecosystems.” Outside of my window in London I can see two ring-necked parakeets in a tree in my garden. Their bright-green plumage and raucous squawking call are not typical of the English garden — these birds are native to Africa and South Asia — but they live now in large numbers in southeastern England, and in the rest of Europe. The parakeets of London nest early in the year and occupy holes in trees that native species such as woodpeckers would use. Pretty though they are, there are thousands in London alone and they are now classified as a pest. In Japan, alien species are widespread and well-established. Some of the native species threatened by invaders are well-known. There is the Amami rabbit, an extremely unusual species of rabbit sometimes called a living fossil as it is so different from other species of rabbit and hare. Carnivores that have been introduced by humans — sometimes deliberately, sometimes accidentally — now threaten the very existence of the Amami rabbit. “The Amami rabbit is one of the most evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered mammals in the world,” says Owen, who works on the EDGE of Existence Program ( www.edgeofexistence.org ), which highlights and conserves evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered animals in the world. “Although declared a Japanese national monument, this species is under threat from the introduced small Asian mongoose — one of the world’s most invasive species — which has killed large numbers of rabbits since their introduction in 1979 to control snakes,” she says. OK, you might be thinking, but the establishment of parakeets in England and Asian mongooses in Japan is hardly enough to qualify as an “apocalyptic” invasion. Even if you add pigeons and cats, it’s not the end of the world. However, there are many thousands more invasive species and, added together, you start to see the scale of the problem. For example, in Europe there are more than 13,000 non-European species that live in the wild. There are hundreds of non-native insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals breeding regularly in Japan — so many that I couldn’t count them all in the database. For anyone interested, Dr. Koichi Goka of the Invasive Species Research Team at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba (my old research institute) has put together a great online resource in English: www.nies.go.jp/biodiversity/invasive/index_en.html . Here are a few of the invaders Japanese biologists are most concerned about. They are classed as “100J” species, the list of Japan’s top 100 worst invasive pests. In Wakayama and Aomori prefectures, Taiwanese macaques have established themselves. They hybridize with native Japanese macaques, so “contaminating” the gene pool of the native species. In Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture, there are populations of snapping turtles, released by people who purchased them as pets. These turtles attack and eat native freshwater animals. There is a moth — the fall webworm — the caterpillars of which devastate native trees. There is even a cane toad. Notorious as one of the worst invasive species in Australia, there are cane toad populations on some Okinawa and Ogasawara islands. The invasion situation is so bad that biologists are proposing a new way of tackling the problem: create a “Black List” of invasive species — the opposite of the Red List of endangered species that is collated by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. It’s not a simple problem to solve. Even if it was easy to catch or kill all the individuals in the wild of the species you were interested in, sometimes a species that is an invader to Japan may be rare elsewhere. This is best illustrated by an exotic and dramatic-looking species that has established itself in Kamogawa and part of the Katsuragawa river network in Kyoto, the Chinese giant salamander. You’ll know it if you see it — they are monsters, growing up to 1.8 meters long. “The Chinese giant salamander (is) another evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered species that is desperately in need of conservation attention in China,” Owen says. “Unfortunately, this species happens to be a major problem in Japan, threatening the native Japanese giant salamander through competition and hybridization.” The biologists proposing the creation of a Black List of invasive species say it can be used to prioritize species for action, as required by international policies on biological invasions. The Convention on Biological Diversity was signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and requires that “By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.” The paper about the Black List is published in PLOS Biology. Humans are, of course, the most dangerous of all species, and could easily be given the No. 1 spot on the Black List. Many scientists are in agreement that the sheer impact of humans on the planet means we have initiated a new geological era: the Anthropocene — the age of human impact. For more on this, I recommend “Adventures in the Anthropocene,” by Gaia Vince (published by Chatto and Windus), an epic, global account of our impact on the biosphere.",

I noticed there were small panels along the sides, but didn’t think anything of it until I entered the water and felt as if I’d been zapped with a cattle prod — an electric current was running through the water! After my initial horror, I discovered the sensation was tolerable as long as I remained in the middle of the space. I have since seen a similar bath in Kyoto. So, what the heck is this and what is its purpose? Ross L., South Australia Dear Ross, I have to say, I’m a little horrified too. Where I grew up, we were taught that water and electricity don’t mix. As a child, I distinctly remember feeling uneasy whenever I took a bath, painfully aware that a total stranger might burst in at any moment, toss a radio or hair dryer into my bath water, and I’d be toast. Bath-time electrocutions were reported regularly in the police-blotter in my hometown newspaper, and were a staple of television throughout my impressionable years. It wasn’t easy to shake such images from my mind as I went to work on your question, but the topic was so electrifying that I was soon fully immersed. I established that the baths you described are called “ denkiburo ” (“electricity baths”) and are also found in public baths, saunas and sports clubs throughout Japan. It’s a wonder I evaded them all these years. Here’s how a denkiburo works: a low-level electric current runs between electrode plates installed below the water surface on either side of the bath. The bather experiences the electric current as a pins-and-needles tingling, expressed in Japanese as piri piri . Some people seem to find this sensation relaxing, while others describe it as downright frightening. Either way, the supposed benefit is relief from katakori (stiff shoulders) and back pain. There’s no scientific proof for this, as far as I could determine, and manufacturers and bath owners are careful not to make health claims. There’s also a rumor that denkiburo reduces sperm count, but I couldn’t find evidence to support that either. So how much electricity actually passes through the body? That depends on many factors, including the mineral composition of the water and how close you get to the electrodes, but it’s less than you can expect from a stun gun. The denkiburo at the Kintoki-yu in Nagoya, according to that bathhouse’s website, delivers “less than 2 volts and 1 ampere, for moderate numbness.” Stay clear of denkiburo if you’ve got a pacemaker installed; even a small jolt of electricity can cause it to malfunction. They’re also not recommended for people with heart murmurs and any of a number of other medical conditions. The history of denkiburo is a bit murky, but they’ve clearly been around since at least 1928, the year mystery writer Juza Unno published a story called “Denkiburo no Kaishi Jiken” (“The Case of the Suspicious Death in the Electricity Bath”). Early denkiburo were crude devices, and completely unregulated, but as far as I can tell, in real life no one has ever kicked the bucket in a denkiburo. As a general rule, I keep my clothes on when I’m working on a column, but if there was ever a question that demanded I get naked, watt the heck, this was it. I couldn’t, in good conscience, write about denkiburo without experiencing one for myself. So I went on the Internet and discovered there was a denkiburo not 10 minutes from my apartment in Tokyo. (And all this time I thought our neighborhood was safe.) I paid my ¥450, left my clothes in a locker and opened the sliding glass door into the baths. After a good wash at the faucets, I wandered through the tub area until I located the denkiburo in a corner of the soaking bath. It was a U-shape partition, open at the front. This allowed me to sit just outside it, water up to my neck, while I gingerly extended one hand into the denkiburo, as far from the side-wall electrodes as possible. I didn’t feel much of anything, so I inched forward, putting all four extremities into range. I felt an unpleasant prickling sensation, but it was bearable, so I turned around and began to back my whole body into the space. I got halfway in, enduring maybe three seconds of exposure, when my entire chest contracted painfully and I was sure death was imminent. I shot the heck out of there. As soon as I vacated an elderly lady moved in, and stayed a good long while with no apparent ill effect. Bath owners install denkiburo as an “attraction,” according to a sales representative at Osaka-based Konishi Electric Co. Ltd., the main supplier of such systems. That’s because people today patronize public baths to relax rather than to get clean. “Until the mid 1950s, having a bathroom in one’s home was a luxury few Japanese could afford,” Norihide Watanabe of the National Federation of Public Baths told me. “In those days, there were tens of thousands of public baths. Today, nearly every Japanese home has a private bath and there are fewer than 5,000 public baths left. There is almost no new bath construction, and as aging owners retire, we’re losing 200 to 300 baths every year. People who continue to patronize public baths are particularly interested in the health benefits of bathing, so it’s important to give them what they want.” I had to wonder, however, if a numbness-inducing, skin-prickling bath truly serves as an attraction. So I went back to the bath near my apartment and posed that very question to the lady at the front desk. Does anyone — other than morbidly curious folks like me — turn up just for the denkiburo? “ Sukina hito wa totemo suki desu yo, ” she assured me. People who like them really like them.",

    "source": "Secrets law far too wide-reaching: U.S. expert <eos> The new state secrets law is so broad that it’s self-defeating and must be amended before it comes into force in December or it will have a chilling effect on free speech, according to U.S. national security and civil liberties expert Morton Halperin. Halperin said in an interview Thursday in Tokyo that the legislation, passed by the Diet last December, is “far out of step with the rest of the world” and should be amended immediately to provide protections for journalists, other private citizens and government whistleblowers. The law’s penalties of up to 10 years in prison for revealing classified information, which applies to private citizens, including journalists, are “dangerous,” and repealing them should be the government’s highest priority, Halperin said. Halperin worked on defense policy and national security in the administrations of Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, and is now a senior adviser at the Open Society Foundations in Washington. The secrets law is part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s policy of creating a framework to protect intelligence sharing with allies, particularly the United States. Halperin said that although the law is largely modeled after that of the United States, the U.S. legislation is not used to file criminal charges against journalists. But the new Japanese law could be used in this way unless it is amended to be made clearer. “The danger is the effect it has on people’s behavior. Even if nobody’s ever indicted, people worry about being indicted, and therefore they say, ‘I’d better not write this story because I may be indicted,’ ” he said. Every country is entitled to keep some secrets for limited periods of time, but laws as broad as Japan’s actually inhibit the protection of genuine secrets because they allow officials to become complacent, Halperin said. “The notion that the way to protect real secrets is to make much more information secret is just wrong,” he said. “If the Japanese government thinks that there’s some operational information about how to work with the American military that needs to be protected, they should protect that information, not pass a statute which would lead to so much information being kept secret that the real secrets will seem trivial.” The law should, in line with those of comparable countries, require the government to more specifically show the harm classified information would cause if released, and consider whether the public value of the information outweighs that harm, he said. The independent secrets review body, which can make classified information public, can only work if it is made up of people from outside government instead of officials, as under the present law, he said. “People who are committed to public debate when they’re outside the government often lose that commitment when they’re in the government, and so you can’t really trust people in the government to have sound judgments on these issues,” he said. The body should consist of “people who are seen by society to have a genuine commitment to openness as well as to classification,” Halperin said. The Abe administration owes it to the public to engage in further dialogue on the law, he said. “I think what the government should do is what it should have done before it passed the law, which is to consult more widely with experts in Japan, but also with international experts, and look at what international standards are, and consider once again whether it can meet those international standards,” he said.",

The representative of The Japan Times further gathered that Mr. Williams wishes he were almost anywhere but in Tokyo — but for preference he would choose a cottage on the Isle of Wight. “The trouble with the Far East, saving of course at the British ports, is that it is too lackadaisical. I have been trying for nearly three weeks to conclude a very simple little business matter about some motors, and would you believe me, I understand that I may have to stay until the first of August? I mean to say the whole method of conducting business matters here seems to me to be mere child’s play, and a waste of time! No one seems very inclined to make up their minds.” Mr. Williams did admit of the uniform courtesy of the Japanese. “They are too polite, confound it! I am dined and motored about to my heart’s content, but if I even hint at the things that are uppermost in my mind a vaguely distressed expression comes across the faces of my hosts as if to say: ‘Oh dear! Now you have spoiled a very pleasant afternoon — or evening as the case may be.'” Mr. Williams finished the conversation in a typically British way by saying: “I can jolly well assure you that if I ever get home I intend to stay there!” 75 YEARS AGO Thursday, June 15, 1939 Seasonal gifts, long hair for males banned Further curtailment of business hours at cafes and bars, simplification of wedding and funeral ceremonies and abolition of banquets are among the proposals which were adopted Tuesday afternoon by the subsidiary committee of the National Spirit Mobilization Committee. Others adopted were abolition of seasonal presents, prohibition of long hair for male students and serving of alcoholic drinks on trains. The code in question will stipulate early rising, punctuality, economic living and particular assiduity at work. 50 YEARS AGO Saturday, June 27, 1964 Recommended tourist spots questioned The Japan Tourist Bureau (JTB) has been working very hard over the years, and is working even harder this year in view of the Olympic Games. I am not at all reluctant to pay tribute to the fine work being done by JTB. Yet, it seems that as far as JTB’s idea of “the places worth seeing” for foreign tourists is concerned, it is firmly fixed into a narrow, conventional mold. I cannot but feel that it is a pity their “places to show foreigners” are limited in most cases to just Hakone, Atami, Nikko, Kyoto, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara and a bit of Kyushu. A friend of mine, an American, was quite disappointed at the program mapped out for him; he went to Kyushu, but Kyushu in his case was Beppu — that noisy uncomfortable place, overcrowd with buses and cars — and Takasaki-yama, famous for its hundreds of monkeys. Takasaki-yama and its monkeys, indeed, mean something to us Japanese because it is the backdrop of one of the masterpieces of postwar literature, “Tadaima Zerohiki” written by the late Ashihei Hino. But for one who has never heard of the novel, it is not an interesting place to see. Instead, he could have visited Kijima-Kogen, which is just one-hour drive from Beppu and is, in my opinion, one of the most restful places Japan can offer today. Surrounded by the graceful Hyuga mountains and facing the black valley created by a stream of lava from Tsurumidake, Kijima lies silently as an oasis. I travel often. And I wonder why the Hokuriku district — the main city of which is Kanazawa — is not considered “officially” by the JTB as a major tourist spot. Also, I have just returned from the Noto Peninsula in Hokuriku and am going again soon for the third time. I have fallen in love with this peninsular, so rich with legends, folklore and epics. The Noto scenery is not spoiled by television towers and antennas; people are not aware as yet of the nature of commercialization. They receive travelers as they did 50 years ago. The quiet beauty of Hiraizumi of Tohoku, the serenity of Teramachi of Yamagata, and the dignity of Kanazawa, famed for its silk and kutani pottery, are among the many places where a foreign visitor may taste something of the richness of this small island nation. (Michiko Inukai) 25 YEARS AGO Thursday, June 8, 1989 Uno deplores use of force in China protests Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, referring to the armed suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing, told the Diet on Wednesday it was extremely regrettable that troops had fired on their fellow citizens. However, he stopped short of openly condemning the Chinese leadership for taking military action. “As the situation of the country is in a state of confusion, with the government, troops and students involved, I’d rather avoid making a black and white judgment,” he said. To justify his reticence, he cited the special nature of Sino-Japanese relations, which are still overshadowed by the war. Because of Japan’s military aggression against China during World War II, government leaders often avoid making remarks that may be seen by the Chinese as interference in their internal affairs, a government source explained. Uno made the remarks in response to a question posed by the Japan Socialist Party’s chairwoman, Takako Doi, in a plenary session of the House of Representatives.",

    "source": "Abbott apologizes for 'winking' at Aussie sex worker <eos> CANBERRA - Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott acknowledged Thursday that he made a mistake by winking with a smile in a talk radio studio while listening to a phone sex worker complain on the air about welfare cutbacks. The gesture, captured Wednesday by a television camera and broadcast prominently in national news bulletins, has proved an unwelcome distraction for Abbott, who is selling unpopular budget cutbacks criticized as betraying his conservative government’s lack of empathy for the poor. A woman who identified herself as Gloria, a chronically ill 67-year-old grandmother, called Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio in Melbourne on Wednesday to ask Abbott how she was supposed to pay an extra 850 Australian dollars ($785) a year in medical expenses that she estimated the budget measures would cost her. Abbott winked and smiled after she told him that she survived on a pension and worked for a phone sex service “to make ends meet.” He later explained that he had been reacting to a smile from the show’s host, Jon Faine, varying from the prime minister’s office’s explanation that Abbott had been signaling to a producer that he was willing to answer the question rather than have the call cut short. “Obviously it was an interesting call from someone who had an interesting story,” Abbott told Perth radio station 6PR later Wednesday. But after a storm of criticism on social media and from political opponents, Abbott conceded on Thursday that he had erred. “I shouldn’t have done it. I should have been more focused on the caller and less focused on the interviewer,” Abbott told the Nine Network television. “Mistakes are always regrettable . . . and I will do my best having made a mistake yesterday to make none today.” A woman identifying herself as Gloria called ABC again on Thursday, condemning Abbott’s wink as “slimy” and “sleazy.” It was a sentiment shared by Sarah Hanson-Young, a senator for the minor Greens party, which has vowed to block some of the government toughest budget measures. “Rather than taking seriously her concerns of poverty and illness, he gave a wink and a smirk, and all I have to say to the prime minister on this is: What a creep. What a total creep,” she said Wednesday. After Abbott acknowledged his mistake, Hanson-Young on Thursday called for Abbott to step down. The criticisms come as opinion polls showed this week that Abbott’s 8-month-old coalition government is now less popular among voters than the center-left Labor Party opposition, after the release last week of the least popular deficit-cutting budget Australia has seen in at least 18 years.",

Downtown Kyoto and neighborhoods near major universities draw huge numbers of young men and women out for a good time, while train and bus stations disgorge teenagers and young adults, sometimes chattering, sometimes sleepy, on their way to or from class or a sightseeing spot with classmates. But as Kyoto police have warned, it’s teenagers who are most at risk from perverts with a camera. The Kyoto Prefectural Police said 51 percent of the victims of illicit photography reported last year were their teens. In 38 percent of the cases, they were photographed on commercial premises, especially shopping malls, while 35 percent were snapped in train and bus stations. In 57 percent of the cases, the alleged perpetrators were charged with illegally taking photos with smartphones. A further 20 percent used regular cell phones and 13 percent used digital cameras. Just over two-thirds of the accused perpetrators were in their 20s and 30s, while one in five was over 40. Only eight percent of the perpetrators were 50 or older. Prefectural governments and police departments, including Kyoto, suggest practical steps high school or college-aged females can take to minimize the chance of becoming an unwitting victim of a pervert with a camera. These include pressing down their skirts when on elevators and staircases, but also being more aware of their surroundings while shopping or using their smartphone while standing. It’s advice so simple some might think it a waste of government time and money to be posting on official government websites. However, a March survey of more than 1,200 teenagers and parents by Digital Arts, a Tokyo-based IT security firm, showed 95 percent of high school girls had mobile devices, and that nearly 30 percent of all high school students were using them between three and six hours a day, checking e-mail, sending text messages, playing games, and so absorbed that they are unaware of their surroundings or what other shoppers, passengers, or people walking or standing behind them might be doing with a smart phone camera.",

    "source": "Kyoto law puts 'upskirt' photography in focus <eos> Each spring, Kyoto is at its busiest. The cherry blossoms bring in multitudes of tourists, and the start of the new academic year means not only thousands of local students returning to the classroom, but also busloads of junior high and high school students from around the country arriving at hotels and taking the obligatory tour of Kyoto’s historical and cultural landmarks. At this time in particular, no visitor can fail to escape the clicking of cameras. Be they the semi-professional photographer, with his Canon EOS ID X, Nest Traveller NT-6294AK tripod and telephoto lens longer than your arm, posed on the banks of the Kamo River waiting for the right mix of light and shadow, or the hordes of tourists prowling the backstreets of Gion with their iPhone cameras, searching for Kyoto “geiko” or, really, anything “Kyotoesque” to quickly snap to prove they were there. Everybody is a shutterbug. But in recent years, the Kyoto police have warned, another kind of photography has become a public nuisance: “Upskirting.” Surreptitious filming or taking of pictures up the skirts of high school females has long made headlines throughout Japan. A whole subgenre of magazines exists for Peeping Toms who earn their living by taking photos on the sly, while the Internet has created unprecedented opportunities for getting photos and video out to the peeping public. In an attempt to crack down on sleazy photographers, Kyoto Prefecture has revised an ordinance that expands the scope of protection. Ordinances forbidding covert filming do exist for public places such as shopping centers, railway stations, trains and buses, which fall under the definition of public buildings and transport systems. The problem, however, is that their scope has traditionally been limited, tying the hands of local governments in preventing perverts from shooting illicit pictures or video, while the punishments have been deemed by police and legal experts as often insufficient to deter perpetrators even if they do get caught. In October 2012, a male teacher at a Kyoto city junior high school was caught taking pictures under girls’ skirts. Kyoto police could not make an arrest for illegally filming and had to arrest him on another charge. But the incident sparked local interest in expanding the definition of the ordinance, which had been limited to “public places and transport.” Expanding the definition beyond “public places,” it had long been felt, ran the risk of violating Article 35 of the Constitution, which states that “the right of all persons to be secure in their homes, papers and effects against entries, searches and seizures shall not be impaired.” But police and law enforcement authorities had long complained that “public places” meant limited protection in quasi-public areas. A Kyoto prefectural survey last year of 1,700 people said 63 percent did not know that schools and private workplaces fall outside the definition of a “public place”. A total of 89 percent favored extending the reach of the ordinance. The newly revised ordinance, approved by the assembly in March, now forbids surreptitious filming at “places likely to come under the public eye.” This means public schools, workplaces, and hospitals are now included in places forbidding such filming or photography. In addition, the revision strengthens the penalty for hidden cameras used at public hot spring bathing areas, changing rooms, and public toilets. Moreover, in an effort to discourage illicit photographers everywhere, it creates stricter penalties for those who are caught doing all surreptitious filming. Previously, punishment was up to six months in jail or a ¥500,000 fine. The new penalty is up to one year in prison or a fine of up to ¥1 million. The change in Kyoto has drawn interest from other local governments. Ishikawa Prefecture plans to propose similar revisions at next month’s assembly, and other governments in the Kansai region have contacted Kyoto Prefecture expressing an interest in adopting something similar. “It’s not just Kyoto. Other prefectures also think that their ordinances are insufficient. Twenty-seven prefectures are now considering similar revisions,” said Tokyo-based lawyer Hiromasa Hasegawa in a recent blog on Kyoto’s revisions. The revision also comes amidst growing concern in Kyoto about crime in general, and violent crimes that may result from taking illicit photos or video, in particular. A separate prefectural survey on safety conducted last year showed that fears of home break-ins accounted for the largest share of concern, with 58.4 percent of the 1,957 residents surveyed in June 2013 saying this is what they feared most. However, some 23 percent said that being filmed illicitly was also on their minds, reflecting increased awareness in Kyoto of the problem. In 2008, Kyoto police sent 32 incidents of illegal filming to the prosecutors, but that figure had increased to 84 cases by 2013. With the new revisions now in place, however, Kyoto has stronger weapons to go after those who would use their cameras for illicit purposes.",

Japan has asked the Netherlands to prevent a recurrence, as the Sea Shepherd group’s vessels fly under Dutch flags, he said. According to a statement released by the Japanese fleet engaged in so-called research whaling, the Japanese harpoon vessels Yushin Maru, Yushin Maru No. 2 and Yushin Maru No. 3 “were subject to sabotage” by the Sea Shepherd ships Steve Irwin and Bob Barker. It said inflatable boats sent from the Sea Shepherd vessels deployed ropes in front of the bows of the Japanese vessels, one of which became entangled in the Yushin Maru’s propeller, while the Bob Barker collided with the stern of the Yushin Maru No. 3, bending its rail and denting the hull. Sea Shepherd called Japan’s account of what happened “an absolute lie” and released footage it said shows an “unprovoked, ruthless and premeditated” attack by the Japanese vessels on the Sea Shepherd ships that lasted for nine hours Sunday morning.

Once promoted as the nation’s largest shopping area for home electronics and computers, where vendors thrived in line with Japan’s postwar surge in prosperity, Akihabara — or “Akiba” for short — is now the center of the nation’s pop culture as well, as typified by pop idol music groups such as AKB48. The groups regularly perform shows at a special “live house” in an entertainment complex called Pasela Resorts Akiba, where an outlet of major electronics vendor Ishimaru Denki once stood. In stark contrast with the chilling cold outside, there was a fiery scene inside earlier this month as young men waving penlights cheered on their favorite idols as they danced to blasting music on a smoky stage bathed in colorful lights. Indeed, the areas around what is now Akihabara, home to lower-ranking samurai warriors in the Edo Period, were prone to fires back then. “Fires and fights are common scenes of Edo,” an old saying goes. After a fire swept through in 1869, the Meiji government built a shrine, later known as Akiba Shrine, to a fire-fighting god. A train station built in 1890 was named Akihabara. Akihabara’s rise to the center of pop culture today, however, has its downsides. The main street was the scene of a tragic killing spree in June 2008, when a truck driven by Tomohiro Kato plowed into a crowded intersection on a busy Sunday. Kato, then 25 years old, got out of the vehicle and began stabbing pedestrians, killing seven and injuring 10 others. Kato, whose death sentence is still pending at the Supreme Court, is said to have nurtured a grudge against his company and society and targeted Akihabara because young people flock there to have fun. After the incident, the vehicle-free “pedestrians’ paradise” on Sundays was suspended, and didn’t resume until 2011. But the closed-off streets where visitors are free to stroll are becoming popular again, according to local merchants. With the help of the nationwide “Cool Japan” campaign to promote anime, “cosplay” (large-scale costume parties) and other things peculiar to Japanese pop culture, Akihabara is drawing the attention not only of young people in Japan, but also overseas. Local residents hope that the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics will provide a platform to promote Akihabara to the world.",

Instead, customers would have the same avenues of legal redress as anyone who entrusted property to an institution that failed to keep it protected, such as negligence, breach of contract or even fraud, said James Grimmelmann, a professor at the University of Maryland who focuses on Internet law. “To me, the first really important conceptual hurdle to get over is that these things really are property,” he said. “When you take money from the public and store it somewhere you claim is secure, you put property law in play.” If Mt. Gox has no assets, however, individual claims would fail to recover any funds, said Daniel Friedberg, a lawyer with Riddell Williams in Seattle who specializes in financial regulatory matters. “The practical reality is, even if you do get a judgment against Mt. Gox, do they have the ability to pay?” Friedberg said. A document circulating online that purports to be a crisis plan for Mt. Gox indicated that the exchange had $174 million in liabilities against $32.75 million in assets, though its veracity could not be confirmed. Tokyo-based Mt. Gox could also file for bankruptcy in Japan, leaving it up to a court to distribute any remaining assets to its creditors. Several regulatory and legal experts said they think the Mt. Gox shutdown could spur regulators to take more immediate steps to protect future customers. Jeffrey Matsuura, a lawyer at Alliance Law Group in Virginia who specializes in online commerce issues, said he wouldn’t be surprised if state or federal consumer protection agencies eventually take some kind of action regarding Mt. Gox and other exchanges. But Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said people who deposited bitcoins with Mt. Gox knew that the exchange had experienced problems in recent months. “At this point, bitcoin is speculative,” he said. “People are going in with eyes wide open.” Thus far, the only U.S. regulatory agency with specific oversight on Mt. Gox is the U.S. Treasury Department’s anti-money laundering unit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. This came about after the exchange agreed to register as a money services business last summer.",

    "source": "Local startup SoftBank on course to become global player <eos> In 2010, three decades after founding telecom giant SoftBank Corp., CEO Masayoshi Son took the stage at the company’s June shareholders’ meeting and made what he thought would be “the most important speech in my life.” The subject? His 30-year vision for the company. As grand as that sounds, SoftBank’s recent moves indicate that the firm is on course, as it spreads its wings and takes flight in the global telecommunications market. Son’s vision included expanding the number of group firms to 5,000 from 800, and breaching the top 10 list of the world’s most valuable companies with a market value of at least ¥200 trillion. The bold acquisition of Sprint Nextel Corp., the third-biggest mobile phone company in the United States, best represents Son’s global ambitions. The deal turned SoftBank, long known as Japan’s No. 3 cellphone company, into a behemoth with about 100 million subscribers worldwide. This means SoftBank is no longer No. 3 in Japan, but in the world. “The domestic market won’t grow as much as it has, so (SoftBank) is making a pre-emptive move to secure growth opportunities,” said Naoki Yokota, chief analyst at SMBC Friend Research Center. Ever since it bought Vodafone’s Japan unit in 2006 and became a cellphone carrier, SoftBank has been on the rise, capitalizing on an almighty lift from the iPhone in 2008 to kick off the smartphone boom in Japan while rival carriers NTT Docomo Inc. and KDDI Corp. dallied before jumping on the bandwagon. SoftBank led in annual subscriber gains for six years in a row and hiked its market share to 22 percent in 2013 from 16 percent in 2006. Its sales and operating profit are constantly on the rise. Yet competition remains tough in Japan, with both Docomo and KDDI both selling Apple’s iPhones, making it difficult for the carriers to differentiate themselves to consumers. Son said there is a risk in sticking to the shrinking Japanese market but admitted competing in the U.S. will also be tough. “We are not sure if our experiences in Japan will work in a different market with different cultures. It’s like a challenge where we are going to have to start from zero,” he said at a news conference for the Spring acquisition in October 2012. “But we may be courting a bigger risk by not challenging” ourselves and staying in Japan, he said. SoftBank’s mission in the U.S. is quite clear: replicate what it did with Vodafone, the struggling third-place carrier SoftBank rebuilt. Since Sprint is far behind top rivals Verizon and AT&T, Son said his firm can re-create the Vodafone scenario in the U.S. as well. Verizon has 32 percent of the U.S. market in terms of subscribers, while AT&T has 30 percent and Sprint just 16 percent. But SoftBank’s prospects for a Sprint turnaround remain unclear as the trio’s handset lineups differ little and all sell the iPhone. Last October, Son said it will take another year to get Sprint ready to compete because its communications networks are weak, and SoftBank needs to provide it with new sales and marketing strategies. SoftBank is also reportedly in talks to acquire T-Mobile, the fourth-biggest U.S. carrier, to further bolster its position. But a Sprint-T-Mobile merger will face scrutiny from the U.S. government over fair competition issues. Son declined to comment on T-Mobile during a news conference last week. “The only thing I can say is that the competition among carriers in the U.S. is not that intense” in terms of networks and prices, said Son. “It is in a state of duopoly under the top two companies (Verizon and AT&T),” he said. While SoftBank is betting big on the U.S. market, this is actually not the first time it has entered America. Back in 1995, it acquired the Comdex computer trade show and Ziff-Davis Publishing, the largest publisher of computer-related magazines, with ambitions for global expansion. But the foray flopped. When SoftBank buys or invests in foreign companies, management is left largely untouched, as was the case with Comdex and Ziff-Davis. Son admitted that approach failed and said he intends to get more involved with Sprint’s management as chairman. “I won’t be just sitting in a chair. . . . I plan to be actively involved with the management,” Son said in October 2012. Last September, SoftBank even built an office in Silicon Valley where executives from both SoftBank and Sprint hold a monthly meeting. The California office is expected be the SoftBank group’s technology hub and have a staff of 1,000. While Sprint is a major part of SoftBank’s overseas strategy, it has been investing and teaming up with other foreign companies as well, such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which runs China’s largest e-commerce site, Ustream Inc., a major video streaming service, and PayPal, the world’s top online payment service. Yet recent investments show that SoftBank is apparently making bid to secure an advantage in the global smartphone arena. For instance, SoftBank spent ¥151 billion in October to buy Supercell, a Finland-based game maker that has produced major smartphone hits, and ¥123 billion to acquire Brightstar, the world’s largest cellphone distributor. Experts say SoftBank is not only aiming to become a global mega-carrier that provides basic communications infrastructure, but a controller of content and distribution networks as well. With smartphones in wide use in developed countries, the handset market has little upside, but the content market will continue to expand, said Yokota of SMBC. The landscape of the communications industry changes so quickly it is hard to project what it will look like in a few years. But Takenobu Miki, who used to head the president’s office at SoftBank and worked side by side with Son, said Softbank’s global strategy seems to be right on track. “For a long time, Son has believed that everything will eventually be communicated through wireless technology,” Miki said. As technology keeps evolving, people are likely to have extremely small but powerful devices that will allow them to communicate wirelessly, said Miki, who now runs Tokyo-based consultancy Japan Flagship Project Co. “If that’s the case, it is natural to secure wireless communication infrastructure and content. Radio waves are limited. It’s a real good investment to secure the best radio waves,” Miki said.",

    "source": "Coastal shipping <eos> Dear Alice, I spotted what I think must be a very unusual ship while riding my bike along the Tokyo waterfront near Wakasu Park. It was like a ferry, in that trucks were driving up a ramp right into the boat. But at the same time a crane was loading shipping containers onto the deck, like a cargo ship. The ship was sizeable but didn’t seem big enough for cross-ocean travel. So where the heck does it go? And what the heck does it carry? Are goods transported within Japan by ship? That would make sense, when you consider this country’s geography, but I admit I’ve never thought about it before. Richard M., Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture Dear Richard, It took a little sleuthing to find out what ships call at Wakasu, and then to narrow the list down to a vessel meeting that description, but I can now say definitively that the ship you saw was the Himawari 1, which travels twice a week between Tokyo and Hokkaido. On a typical voyage, the ship departs Tokyo at 9 p.m. with a mixed load of daily necessities, beverages and old newspapers bound for recycling. It arrives two days later in the port of Tomakomai. By evening, it’s ready to head back to Tokyo with a new cargo of agricultural goods and paper products made from the recycled newspapers. This kind of shipping, in which cargo is moved by water without crossing a major ocean, is called “coastal shipping” in English and “ naikō kaiun ” in Japanese. To find out more, I paid a visit to the Japan Federation of Coastal Shipping Associations (JFCSA) headquarters in Tokyo, where I learned that coastal shipping accounts for about 40 percent of Japan’s domestic cargo transportation. That’s on what’s called a “tonnage kilometer” basis, which means you factor in both weight and distance. About 80 percent of the raw materials used by Japanese industry, including petroleum products, iron, steel, cement and limestone are transported by coastal shipping, according to JFCSA. Japan’s geography does indeed seem to favor coastal shipping, since it is long and narrow and surrounded by ocean. The center of the country is mountainous, which makes land travel difficult, and most of the population lives near coastal ports. During the Edo Period (1603-1868), the Tokugawa shogunate set up sophisticated systems for moving large quantities of goods by boats that sailed up and down the coasts. But in the 19th and 20th centuries, coastal shipping gradually lost ground to railroads and trucks. Currently, more goods are moved within Japan by trucks than any other method, accounting for about 55 percent of shipments on that same tonnage kilometer basis, and more when calculated in other ways. Shipments by rail and air make up only a small percentage of shipments within Japan. Trucking is convenient because goods can be delivered door-to-door, without the need to load and unload at intermediate points along the way. But Japan’s highways are congested and the trucking industry suffers from a severe shortage of drivers, as experienced drivers age and young people shun the work as too difficult. To help ensure the smooth movement of goods, the government is now encouraging a “modal shift” to move a portion of the freight carried by trucks to coastal shipping. That would not only ease the pressure on the trucking industry, but would also help the country meet its goals for reduction of carbon-dioxide emissions, because coastal shipping is more energy efficient. Moving one ton of freight by sea creates one-fifth the CO₂ emissions produced by moving the same weight by truck. But let me steer us back to the specific ship you saw, which is operated by Nippon Express, a major player in domestic and international logistics. Shigenori Makino of the company’s coastal shipping group confirmed that the Himawari 1 is an unusual combination of a container ship and what’s called a “roll on/roll off” (RORO) ship, or roro-sen in Japanese. RORO ships are designed to carry cargo vehicles that are driven on and off the ship. This is in contrast to lift-on/lift-off (LOLO) vessels, which use a crane to load and unload cargo. Small ferries that operate across short distances also have built-in ramps, but the term RORO is generally reserved for larger, ocean-going vessels. “Himawari 1 can accommodate 50 12-meter truck trailers in a section we call the ‘chassis hold,’ but it can also carry 400 shipping containers in the container holds toward the front of the ship,” Makino told me. The other special feature that distinguishes this ship, he said, is that it has an onboard gantry crane. “Normally, containers are loaded on and off ships with cranes that are built as part of the port facilities. But because the Himawari 1 has its own crane on board, it has more flexibility in loading and unloading and can call at ports that don’t have cranes.” This flexibility was a saving grace immediately after the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011, when the Himawari 1 was sent to Tohoku on a special relief mission to carry emergency supplies of heating fuel to the disaster area. At the time, it was difficult for trucks to reach the area because of massive damage to the road systems, and it was unclear what damage the facilities in the port of Sendai had suffered. “There were many lessons learned as a result of the Great East Japan Earthquake, but one of those was the importance of maintaining a healthy coastal shipping network so that goods can be moved by sea when a disaster interrupts other modes of transportation,” Hideo Fujii of the JFCSA told me. “We in the industry are preparing for future disasters, and will work with national and local governments to ensure that food, fuel and supplies can be transported quickly and safely to affected areas.”",

Their anime tie-up rosters includes Kamen Rider, Pokémon, Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger, One Piece, Yokai Watch and more. With the initial round of Hako Vision releases, however, they’re doing something a little different. Did you ever imagine you’d be watching recreations of popular projection-mapping shows rigged up with your smartphone and a cardboard box? While chewing grape-flavored gum?! You can think of it as the latest evolution of shokugan (“candy toy”) culture that supposedly has its roots in Meiji Era collectible cards that came packed in cigarettes (definitely not for kids), or a new direction in diorama construction for the 21st century. As of Jan. 27, there are two kits available for ¥500 each: Tokyo Michiterasu 2012 “Tokyo Hikari Vision” and the Tokyo National Museum’s “Karakuri” (2013). The package itself is the stage for the miniaturized versions of these special events (“hako” means “box”), so don’t go tearing it up to get inside. Once you set up the scale model of the building to be projected on and the reflecting panel, all you need is the lighting, which you provide by pulling up a specially made video on your smartphone and laying it on top like a roof to your cardboard theater. Projection-mapping itself seems to be all over the place lately. Even just in the past several months The Japan Times has noted Tower of the Sun Beam Painting, Art Aquarium 2013 , “live” Hatsune Miku shows presented by NTT Docomo, and Yokohama Odyssey . On the horizon, Disney (pioneering projection-mapping tech for years — since building the Haunted Mansion ride in 1969 according to Projection Mapping Central ) is debuting a new show mapped to Cinderella’s Castle at Tokyo Disneyland May 29th . As for the future of Hako Vision itself, Bandai already has big plans. Instead of just continuing to reproduce shows people have already seen life size, they’re creating original videos to go with Mobile Suit Gundam figures. Giant mecha familiar to fans of the anime, Gundam and Zaku II, each get their own video helmed by creative director Ryotaro Muromatsu of Naked Inc., the same company that produced the video for “Tokyo Hikari Vision.” The new kits go on sale April 14. Needless to say, if Hako Vision catches on, the licensing possibilities at Bandai are nearly endless. And now that the kits are out in the wild it’s not hard to imagine fans of the tech creating their own models and fantastic videos to go with them.",

    "source": "Female scientists push for breakthrough in equality <eos> Recent news that Haruko Obokata of Riken’s Center for Developmental Biology found a new way to generate pluripotent cells cast a spotlight on women in the male-dominant field of science. While figures show they are still a minority, Nagoya University is actively hiring women with hidden talents, and its efforts are bearing fruit. The Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry conducted a survey in 2012 and found that women constitute a mere 14 percent of all researchers in Japan. By comparison, more than 30 percent of the researchers in the United States and United Kingdom are women. In Japan, women’s numbers are particularly low in the physical sciences, engineering and agriculture. Nagoya University, which has gained a reputation for scientific research, is no exception. These fields are largely dominated by men at the university, which has only 45 female professors, excluding contract faculty. This translates into a ratio of around 4.8 percent. “You aren’t actually thinking of becoming a professor, are you?’ That’s what some of us have been asked just because we are women,” said Ikue Mori, who was promoted to professor in the biological science division at Nagoya University in 2004. “I hope that Haruko Obokata and her research work can improve the tough situation for women here,” she said. The general lack of understanding of what a woman goes through during pregnancy or when giving birth is another reason women tend to avoid careers in research. One female researcher had to be hospitalized suddenly because she was at risk of premature delivery. When she came back to the laboratory, she allegedly found all her research equipment left outside in the corridor and her desk gone. To help change attitudes in this male-dominant workplace, Nagoya University launched a program in 2010 to train female researchers in the sciences. It also set a quota for female researchers and publicly advertised for them. It also started to offer support for female professors and associate professors, such as research grants and personnel expenses to hire assistants for those who are pregnant or have children. As a result, as of July 2012, the number of female researchers in the science, technology and agriculture fields has climbed to 6.2 percent, and two women in their 30s were promoted to professors. One of them is Azusa Kamikochi, a researcher from Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences who gained attention for her work in brain research. She is also the mother of a 3-year-old daughter. “Obokata’s research has produced brilliant results. I hope the time will come when she will be recognized for her astounding work and not because she is a young female researcher,” said Kamikochi. The program was originally scheduled to end in 2015, but Nagoya University has decided to continue it. “Female researches have great potential for growth. Their talents have remained overshadowed by male researchers, but I think it’s their time to shine now,” said President Michinari Hamaguchi.",

The problem: Russians have gone nuts for pet squirrels. Moscow authorities bolstered security early this month for all of the city’s green areas after city official Alexei Gorelov said he had received multiple reports of squirrel poaching. Gorelov, who heads an Ecological Control unit, said more police patrols are being dispatched to fend off the poachers, who can be fined up to 20,000 rubles ($573). Noting that squirrels are of little use for their meat or their fur, he said that most of the poached park squirrels were resold to people as pets for 5,000 rubles ($144) each. “(Wild) animals have to be enjoyed from a distance,” said Gorelov as he scrolled through a Russian website selling squirrel pets. Despite the website’s claims that squirrels are a “friendly and gentle” animal that can be kept around the house, they can bite and are not domesticated. Some animal lovers were outraged at the poaching. “The fine should not be 5,000 rubles, it should be 500,000 rubles for this kind of poaching,” said Alexandra Mishenko, a retiree who feeds the squirrels in Moscow’s parks. “We should gather people together and pelt the person who does that with snow,” she said, her eyes welling with tears.",

Bonin liner Chefoo, which returned to Yokohama yesterday, gave an interesting account of her exploration of the newly formed island near Minami Iwojima. On its northeastern side, the island, which has been created by a recent volcanic eruption, has precipices that have collapsed or washed away at places. From the crumpled earth in the sea shot up smoke, and the scene presents a most entertaining spectacle. On the western side of the island is a flat beach. The crew landed by canoe and stayed ashore one hour, then came to the southeast of the island whence they could plainly see the crater. Ash, pumice-stones and steam were being sent up in immense volume to a height of some 500 feet (150 meters). The new island is located two miles and a half to the south of Minami Iwojima. It stands 590 feet (180 meters) above sea level, and extends three quarters of a mile (1.2 km) from south to north. The water in the sea surrounding the new island is tepidly warm. The heap of ash on the island is knee-deep. The island described here has since disappeared. 75 YEARS AGO Saturday, Feb. 11, 1939 Japanese forces land on Hainan Island Japanese Army and Navy forces, operating in close collaboration, at daybreak yesterday succeeded in making a surprise landing on Hainan Island off the South China coast, and have been continuing an advance, an official communique by the Imperial Headquarters revealed. The occupation of Hainan Island, it is believed, will further strengthen the naval blockade now enforced all over China’s water by the Japanese Navy, and will simultaneously cause a heavy blow to munitions transportation by various routes in south China. Tatsuo Kawai, spokesman of the Foreign Office, told journalists the operation does not violate the Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907. “The present Japanese operation is for the purpose of exterminating the Chinese military forces in the island and is therefore an affair which has nothing to do with the question of assuring peace and security envisaged by the Japanese-French Agreement.” 50 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Feb. 25, 1964 Personality profile: Kyu Sakamoto The coffee shop in the neon-lit Shibuya alley shook with the flamboyant jazz of the five-piece band. Every seat on two floors was taken, and the teenage audience tapped its toes while waiters whisked around with ice cream and red and green sodas. Desultory applause changed to enthusiasm when the idol stepped forward to the microphone, the one-of-their-kind, Kyu Sakamoto. Kyu-chan, 22 years old, international star with fan mail from across the world, smiled his natural impish smile. He has the gift all right. “Good-bye, Joe,” he sang in his breathy voice, and his rhythm was infectious and irresistible. But back-stage, Kyu-chan looked wan. His life keeps him on the run between rehearsals, recording studios, TV studios. “I love fast cars,” he said. “But — no time.” Kyu, ninth and last child in his family, is the son of a Kawasaki restaurateur. “I was a very naughty little boy,” he volunteered. Six years ago, inspired by Elvis Presley, he decided to be a singer, and his efforts filled his life to the extent that his high school education remained uncompleted. His rendition of the song that became known overseas as “Sukiyaki” put him at the top of the American hit parade, the first Japanese ever to win such distinction. “Then,” he said, “my mother was happy, so I was happy.” He is happier still now that he has built a new house for his mother, and lives with her in it. During a half-hour break before going on stage again, he recalled his trips abroad. “Rome is like Tokyo, but Hollywood — wonderful! I flew over Hollywood in a helicopter. Wonderful!” In the late spring he is scheduled to go to America again for a series of appearances. He then explained that he hopes to build a steady future as an actor in moving pictures. And marriage? “Later,” said Kyu-chan seriously. “Much, much later.” Modern young people come in for a lot of criticism in one way and another. A boy like Kyu-chan makes you feel that the generation is not a lost one. To have known his success and to have come through unspoiled and likeable says a lot for the stuff of which he is made. 25 YEARS AGO Saturday, Feb. 4, 1989 Anti-Emperor leftists suspected in bombing An explosion rocked the main building of Togo Shrine in Tokyo’s Shibuya Ward early Friday morning, causing damage to the front door and ceiling. Police are investigating the incident as a suspected bomb attack by leftist anti-establishment radicals aiming to obstruct the Feb. 24 funeral for Emperor Showa. The explosion occurred shortly after 4 a.m. Police officers dispatched to the shrine found the front door to the main building shattered and part of the ceiling collapsed. The explosion triggered a fire that scorched the pillars of an outdoor passage connecting the main building and a room for the tea ceremony. The shrine was established in 1940 in memory of Adm. Heihachiro Togo, the victor of the sea Battle of Tsushima over a tsarist Russian armada in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05. Togo served in the 1920s as chief tutor to the late monarch, who was then the Crown Prince. There have been seven similar incidents. Police believe all are linked to organizations that have voiced opposition to the emperor system since the Jan. 7 death of Emperor Showa.

    "source": "'Warring States' turmoil alive and well <eos> OSAKA - Japanese historians date the Warring States Period roughly from the middle of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century. But when it comes to Kansai politics, modern observers could be forgiven for thinking the ancient feuds and jealous rivalries of the regional lords are not yet over. That’s because the daimyo of Osaka Castle (i.e. Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto) is attempting to lead the region’s most prosperous city on a quest to unify the surrounding fiefdoms (Hyogo, Kyoto, Wakayama, Shiga, Tokushima, and Tottori prefectures) under a single banner (a Kansai regional block system) so as to challenge the dominant samurai and mandarins far to the east in what was once mosquito-infested swampland but is now the capital city of Edo (Tokyo). Unfortunately for Hashimoto, his attempts are being thwarted as rivals plot against him. Not in Edo Castle, where the courtiers must be looking upon Kansai politics with a combination of amusement and, possibly, disbelief, but in nearby Hyogo. Hyogo Gov. Toshizo Ido, a Hashimoto critic, is the nominal head of the Union of Kansai Governments, which, in theory, supports a regional block system. But he’s made it clear he does not favor a more powerful Osaka at the expense of Hyogo. On the other hand, Kyoto Gov. Keiji Yamada appears to be a Hashimoto fan. But for many in cultured, refined Kyoto, Osaka is town of coarse merchants best avoided, so there are limits on how much cooperation will be offered to Osaka. Meanwhile, Nara Gov. Shogo Arai prefers neutrality, keeping his prefecture out of the union and saying there is no benefit to his rural prefecture in competing with urban Osaka. Other governors are more supportive, but that’s because they lack major cities vying with Osaka for power and prominence. Historically, Kansai’s prefectures have fought among themselves for state funding, resulting in massive duplicity. Should Kansai airport be built in Osaka Prefecture? It eventually was. Kobe in Hyogo then followed by pursuing its own airport. From tourism promotion to public works projects, if one gets money from Tokyo, you can bet the others will ask for the same. A “republic of Kansai” is supposed to end the Kansai Warring States Period. But given that Hashimoto can’t even reorganize his own city, it will likely be a long while before some historian writes the saga’s final chapter.",

    "source": "Final season for 'Toru Hashimoto Show'? <eos> Is “The Toru Hashimoto Show,” the long-running Osaka political drama — which some might call a farce and others a tragedy — entering its final season? That’s the question Osakans of all political stripes are asking with the mercurial mayor set to leave office at the end of this month, only to stand for re-election March 23 for reasons not even Hashimoto’s most ardent supporters can fully explain. Officially, his resignation was prompted by anger at the lack of progress a committee of local politicians made in discussing his and his Osaka Ishin no Kai (One Osaka) political group’s goal of integrating the city of Osaka with Osaka Prefecture by April next year. The snap election is unlikely to change anything because Osaka Ishin does not have a majority in the municipal assembly and all other parties oppose Hashimoto’s integration schedule. Integration plans must be approved by the city assembly before a referendum can be held. But that has not stopped the mayor from deciding that the only way to bring about a citizen’s vote on a final plan, scheduled for October, is to hold an election now. “This election is about whether Osaka should be given the chance to vote this autumn in a referendum on an integration plan that needs to be finished by summer,” Hashimoto said earlier this month. In 13 committee meetings, four plans have emerged. The one favored by Hashimoto consolidates the city of Osaka’s 24 wards into five large districts. Each will enjoy much more power, especially of the purse, while Osaka City Hall would cease to function in its current capacity. That is just the first step toward integrating the rest of the prefecture into a single political and bureaucratic entity similar, in many respects, to Tokyo. Then, Hashimoto hopes, the stage will be set to achieve his ultimate goal, a “republic of Kansai” that would turn the region into a large, powerful entity akin to a Swiss canton, a Canadian province or a U.S. state. All of these ideas have long been greeted with varying degrees of opposition by the central government’s ministries in Tokyo, which are loathe to cede any financial or bureaucratic control over the local governments. But what prompted Hashimoto to resign earlier this month was not the resistance in Tokyo, but in Osaka, especially from then-ally New Komeito. When New Komeito, which forms a majority with Osaka Ishin in the municipal and prefectural assemblies, opposed combining the four integration proposals into one at the late January meeting, it was, for Hashimoto, the last straw. He launched a verbal tirade against New Komeito. In a remark aimed at the party’s Buddhist support group Soka Gakkai, the mayor implied that New Komeito politicians were behaving like religious followers. He also charged that New Komeito’s opposition broke an agreement with Osaka Ishin made before the 2012 Lower House election to support the Osaka integration plan in exchange for a promise from Hashimoto that his national Nippon Ishin no Kai (Japan Restoration Party) would not field candidates against New Komeito in six districts. All six New Komeito candidates won. But the party says it remembers what it promised Hashimoto quite differently. Regardless, it was clear long before 2012 that New Komeito’s Osaka branch had doubts about the integration plan, particularly the timetable that was attached to it. “What’s important is not to adhere to some schedule for integration but to deepen discussion of creating a system by looking at a variety of angles. We want to continue careful talks on the matter,” New Komeito Osaka prefectural assemblyman Yoshito Shimizu told the joint city-prefecture committee, a comment that angered Hashimoto and led to his resignation. Since then, the rift between New Komeito and Hashimoto has become a chasm, with Hashimoto threatening to personally run against New Komeito candidates in the next Lower House election and creating worries in Osaka that the lack of trust between the two now means that little or nothing will get done in the municipal and prefectural assemblies until local elections next year. In Tokyo, some Liberal Democratic Party members sense an opportunity, and are hoping the party’s Osaka chapter work out a deal with Osaka Ishin. Osaka Gov. Ichiro Matsui was with the LDP before he defected to Hashimoto’s movement. Matsui continues to stay in touch with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s team and briefly met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga in mid-February. The meeting was ostensibly about legislation for a casino proposal. But Matsui and the fellow LDP lawmakers who joined him in defecting to Hashimoto’s movement must also be wondering if it isn’t time to consider a rapprochement with their old party. In mid-February, polls by the Yomiuri and Sankei newspapers, normally Hashimoto’s strongest media allies, showed that more than 60 percent of Osaka voters disagreed with Hashimoto’s desire for a snap election. And the percentage of Osakans who backed Hashimoto — once between 80 and 90 percent — had dropped to under 50 percent. Yet despite Hashimoto’s sinking popularity and a growing sense of disappointment over his actions, no political party is currently challenging him in the election, slated for March 23. The likely exception, as of last week, might be Makoto Tonami, aka “Mack” Akasaka, leader of the Smile Party. A 10-time candidate in various elections, including the recent Tokyo gubernatorial election, the 65-year-old Akasaka has appeared in campaign commercials dressed variously as an angel (while wearing a “Hooters” T-shirt), Superman or a Gandhi look-alike. He advocates a healthier lifestyle through “smile therapy” and gets up to dance during staid NHK campaign videos. He advocates complete unarmed neutrality for Japan and mandatory voting. Hashimoto claims to welcome Akasaka as an opponent, even as he criticized the established parties for sitting out the election. But as one observer said jokingly, given the state of Osaka politics today, perhaps Akasaka’s most appropriate campaign poster might just be a photo of him grinning madly in an outrageous costume under a caption that reads: “Don’t Vote for the Fool in This Election.”",

    "source": "Leave Article 9 alone: New Komeito's Osaka women <eos> Political alliances often resemble shotgun weddings. But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and smaller opposition forces such as Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto’s Nippon Ishin no Kai (Japan Restoration Party) that are pushing to amend the Constitution are now wondering if their efforts will fail due to a group of Osaka women who have made it clear some things will not be compromised for the sake of marriage. New Komeito is in the odd position of serving as the LDP’s coalition partner in the Diet, where Nippon Ishin is officially the opposition. Yet New Komeito — at least for the moment — is also Nippon Ishin’s partner in the Osaka Municipal and Prefectural assemblies, where the LDP is the opposition. Of course, New Komeito’s strongest supporters are in Soka Gakkai, the lay Buddhist group whose critics accuse it of being a powerful cult. But there is no doubt about two things. First, Soka Gakkai and New Komeito oppose revoking Article 9 of the Constitution, the “no-war clause,” along the lines Abe and Nippon Ishin co-leader Shintaro Ishihara envision. Second, New Komeito and Soka Gakkai are strong in Osaka. In particular, the women of Soka Gakkai who support New Komeito are organized, disciplined, and, in the grand tradition of Osaka, not afraid to speak their minds. Of New Komeito’s 51 Diet members, nine are from Osaka, the largest concentration of the party’s politicians in the country. In short, when New Komeito’s Osaka supporters talk, regardless of whether they belong to Soka Gakkai, the party listens. That’s what frustrates Takeo Hiranuma, co-leader of Nippon Ishin’s Diet group. Last year, he was quoted as saying the constitutional revision was being blocked “by a group of ladies in Osaka,” a not-so-subtle reference to New Komeito female voters there who like Article 9 just the way it is, thank you very much. However, Hiranuma’s view ignores two realities: The first is numbers-based, while the second has to do with history, myth and stereotypes that play a role in broader Osaka attitudes toward itself, Article 9 and those who would scrap it. First, Abe and the LDP want to change Article 9 by first revising Article 96, which stipulates a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of the Diet is needed to amend the Constitution. The LDP, Nippon Ishin and Your Party want to lower that to a simple majority. New Komeito is cautious, to say the least, about changing Article 96. Theoretically, Abe could team up with Nippon Ishin. But that likely means ditching New Komeito as a coalition partner — a heavy price to pay. The party’s ability to get things done for its voters and for those in LDP districts is widely respected in and out of the LDP, while Nippon Ishin Diet members are, by and large, inexperienced amateurs detested by the bureaucrats. Nor is opposition to revising Article 9 limited to New Komeito voters who belong to Soka Gakkai. As an ancient merchant city that was trading with Korea and China when Tokyo was nothing but swampland, Osaka’s historical mindset has traditionally been one of “war is bad for business.” During the Edo Period, the ruling samurai were seen by Osaka’s merchants less as loyal and honorable guardians and more as lazy braggarts who got drunk and were easily fleeced at the gaming tables. In the 1930s, Osaka had a reputation as being a particularly difficult place to recruit soldiers and sailors. Thus, with its long history of Asian ties, a preference for commerce over military adventures, and a strong contempt for Tokyo’s bureaucratic politics, large numbers of Osakans, not just a few Osaka women in one political party, do not share, even today, an inclination to revise Article 9 simply because Tokyo politicians say it’s necessary.",

    "source": "Stem-cell leap defied Japanese norms <eos> It’s not surprising that last week Haruko Obokata issued a plea for privacy. On Jan. 29 she published a scientific paper on stem cells that could revolutionize medicine, and overnight the researcher based at the Riken Center for Developmental Biology (CDB) in Kobe became a domestic and international star. The onslaught of media attention went beyond what Obokata had discovered — a way to revert ordinary cells from the body into kansaibō (stem cells), cells with the ability to develop into any cell type. These cells, known as pluripotent stem cells, have long been seen as the key to regenerative medicine, because in theory they can be grown into new organs and tissues. As a young female scientist, Obokata is something of a rarity in Japan, and many reports included details of her life it’s hard to imagine being discussed if she was a man. Her laboratory is painted pink and yellow, and is decorated with pictures of Moomin characters from children’s books. She is 30, has a pet turtle — and a boyfriend. Instead of a lab coat, she wears a Japanese apron, a kappogi , originally designed to be worn over a kimono. The Internet shopping service Rakuten Ichiba reported a sharp increase in kappogi sales after the publicity. But none of this would have been news had Obokata’s work not been so amazing. When we heard of it in the New Scientist office here in London, where I am the news editor, we just couldn’t believe it. It is certainly possible to make pluripotent stem cells, and I’ve reported here about the work of another Japanese pioneer in that field, Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University. But Obokata’s method was so incredible in its simplicity that it almost sounded too good to be true. Yamanaka had identified four genetic factors that, when transferred into an adult cell using a virus, could cause it to revert to a pluripotent stem cell. This breakthrough work won Yamanaka a share of a Nobel Prize — but one of the inherent problems there is that transferring the four genetic factors can also cause cancer. Obokata’s work seems to avoid this completely. Rather than using a virus and infecting cells with genetic factors, she simply stresses them. Squeezing cells through narrow tubes or bathing them in an acidic solution turns them pluripotent. Surely, we thought, it can’t be so easy? It turns out that the editors at Nature, the British journal where Obokata’s work was published, couldn’t believe it either. When she and her colleagues submitted the work for publication in 2012, it was rejected. She went away, worked on more experiments and resubmitted. This time, after yet more extensive checks, the journal accepted the paper. And the scientific — and general — media deluge began. Other labs are already trying to replicate the work, and some scientists remain skeptical despite the extra-stringent review process prior to publication. One of the first things I wondered was whether, if this is the real thing, Obokata and her team have patented the discovery. The secret to a simple method for making pluripotent stem cells could be worth a fortune. At a press conference just before publication, where she was asked about this, Obokata replied: “Yes, we have a patent” — before abruptly stopping. “Actually, I have to say ‘no comment,’ ” she said. Clearly there are plans in motion behind the scenes. The Asahi Shimbun then reported that Obokata’s group had started with patent applications in April 2013. We can expect big things. One of the reasons this has caused such a sensation is that it comes out of left field. Her work is a great advert for thinking and working differently from the crowd — not a traditional approach for a Japanese scientist. Obokata’s co-author, Yoshiki Sasai, also at the Riken CDB, praised the approach, saying, “She held her own view backed by data.” Riken CDB is abuzz with important work at the moment. As I reported here in December, another stem-cell biologist there, Masayo Takahashi, is about to conduct the world’s first stem-cell trial on humans. In an interview with New Scientist, she praised Obokata’s discovery, saying, “I feel joyful that we are both working in this wonderful area of science.” So it’s a fascinating time — and fantastic to see women pioneering this research. However, Japan’s media still has a long way to go regarding its portrayal of women. After all, a piece in the Yomiuri Shimbun soon after Obokata’s paper was published ended with the cheesy observation that “she always strives to be fashionable as well.”",

    "source": "Once upon a time, China anointed a 'King of Japan' <eos> In 1401, barely a century after the Mongols’ aborted invasions of Japan, and 600-odd years before Japan and China fell out over the Senkaku islets, a Chinese emperor conferred upon a Japanese shogun the title “King of Japan.” Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358-1408) was overjoyed at this mark of distinction. In a letter he sent via a trading delegation to Emperor Hung Wu, founder of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Shogun Yoshimitsu willingly struck the pose expected of him: “In fear and dread, kneeling again and again, I respectfully state … ” The Chinese reply rewarded flattery with flattery, noting: “Japan has always been known as a country of poems and books.” In the lively correspondence that followed, Yoshimitsu signed himself, “King of Japan, Your Subject.” Future generations were appalled. How low had Japan sunk? In accepting vassalage, Yoshimitsu had betrayed his country; in accepting a royal title he had betrayed his Emperor, Japan’s true (if politically impotent) “king.” Sino-Japanese relations lose much of their savor if we view them only in the present. The current confrontation — dramatic and ominous enough, by modern standards — has a deep, deep background. China was Japan’s primary school teacher in the arts of civilization — religion (Buddhism), government (Confucianism) and so on. In the ninth century, after 400 years of intense discipleship, Japan turned inward. It stopped sending missions to China’s court and its monasteries. It needed to digest, to “Japanize” its acquisitions. The Heian Period (794-1185) is often called Japan’s first “Japanese” culture. China continued to loom large, an influence and a point of reference, but classical Heian literature constitutes in effect a declaration of cultural independence. Barbarian hordes from Mongolia conquered China in the 13th century. From their new capital at Peking they subjugated Russia and penetrated Poland and Hungary. The Mongol Empire at its peak was twice the size of the Roman Empire at its peak. When Kublai Khan, who ruled from 1259 to 1294, turned his hungry gaze on the remote islands of Japan, they must have looked like sitting ducks. The two invasions he launched, in 1274 and 1281, came to grief, casualties of fierce Japanese resistance and storms at sea that the Japanese mythologized as kamikaze — divine winds. Yoshimitsu, age 9, became shogun in 1367. The following year, the Chinese overthrew the Mongols. Then, in 1369, an envoy from Ming China arrived in Kyushu to discuss a persistent irritation — Japanese pirates. For centuries these marauders were the scourge of eastern Asia. China seemed helpless against their relentless attacks on its coast. Why Kyushu? The situation in Japan was confused. The country was divided. Two Imperial lines vied for supremacy — the Northern Court based in Kyoto and the Southern Court based in the mountains of Yoshino, some 100 km south. The Northern Court had the support of the shogunate, but the Southern Court controlled Kyushu, whose western coast was a veritable pirates’ nest — and Chinese information had it that the potentate in those parts, one Prince Kanenaga, was “King of Japan.” The “king” gave the envoy short shrift — in fact he put him under arrest. But the domestic tide was turning against him, and he changed his mind. A Chinese ally would be useful. He agreed to curb the pirates in return for Chinese support. It all came to naught. Yoshimitsu’s armies toppled Kanenaga, seized Kyushu, and at last brought the two courts together. That was in 1392. Now Yoshimitsu could turn to what he liked best. He was an effervescent, extravagant man, a great builder and a great spender. He sponsored noh theater, then in its infancy, and supported Zen Buddhism, to which he was deeply devoted. The project for which posterity best remembers him is Kyoto’s Kinkakuji — the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, built as a private retreat in 1394. No expense was spared. Where was the money to come from? From trade with China, he hoped. Ming China had a curious attitude to foreign trade. China was an ancient civilization, and a haughty one. China (in its own mind) was the “middle kingdom,” the center of the world. China had everything; it needed nothing. Trade, in the traditional Chinese view, meant China loftily accepting humbly presented “tribute.” The gifts it offered in return were not by way of commerce but symbols of China’s overflowing generosity. The master-disciple, lord-vassal relationship was implicit — taken for granted by China, swallowed with grace or resentment by “tributary” states. The Mongol interlude had been a deep humiliation which the early Ming emperors were determined to efface. Doing business with them meant kowtowing. Yoshimitsu could take it or leave it. He took it. He accepted the “King of Japan” title, despite the implied vassalage, and even brandished it against those Kyushu nobles who retained a menacing independence of spirit. As part of the agreement, he suppressed the rapacious pirates — boiling alive is one punishment mentioned in grateful Chinese records. The trade, under a licensing system whose limits were largely ignored, was lucrative. Japan sent laquerware, bronze vessels, fans, sulfur (used in papermaking) and — perhaps its most famous export — swords. In return it imported silk, drugs, books, porcelain and (most significantly) copper coins, representing the birth of a money economy. The story has a surprising sequel. In 1863, 455 years after Yoshimitsu’s death, a band of imperial loyalists burst into the Toji-in Temple in Kyoto and furiously “beheaded” three statues — Yoshimitsu’s and those of his two Ashikaga shogun predecessors. The wooden heads were displayed on a Kyoto riverbank, over a placard reading: “These three traitors having done the worst evil, their vile statues have been visited with the vengeance of heaven.” What would Yoshimitsu, “King of Japan,” have made of that?",

The group was due to play an open-air concert with headline act Eminem on Saturday in Auckland. Border Operations Manager Karen Urwin said that authorities decided to decline visas to six group members after becoming aware of a 2011 incident in Boston in which some witnesses claimed group members incited fans to attack police officers. “It’s not a decision we take lightly and not one that happens often,” Urwin said. Group member Tyler, The Creator vented his frustration on Twitter on Thursday. “They said we were ‘terrorist threats and bad for the society’ or whatever. Sick,” he wrote. He later tweeted, “I love NZ tho.” The hip-hop group, which is also known as Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, is known for its anarchic style and lyrics that canvas drugs, killing and rape. Urwin said the six rappers had intended to stay in New Zealand just a few days before leaving for Australia. She said it is rare to ban musicians under rules that cover character concerns. She said those provisions have been used in the past to stop people like white supremacist leaders and high-profile Holocaust deniers. She said some people have wrongly assumed that authorities considered the group’s lyrics in imposing the ban. “If we banned people who used swear words, we wouldn’t have many people left in New Zealand,” she said.",

    "source": "Return of shunto is hollow triumph for unions <eos> S hunto is in full swing. Or so it should be. Or so they say. Shunto is the Japanese word for the annual spring round of wage negotiations conducted between big business and trade unions. This “spring offensive” used to feature large in the annual economic calendar. As the deflationary 1990s and beyond set in, this offensive became an offensive no more. Faced with the prospect of corporate bankruptcies and accompanying job losses, labor unions rapidly lost their teeth. Gone are the days when the leaders of the large industry-wide unions were referred to as kings and emperors. In such times, a mere prime minister would balk at face-to-face meetings with those elites of the working classes. A head of government could not possibly compete with the clout and influence enjoyed by the captains of the labor movement. Media reports suggest that shunto is back. Given the pressure that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has brought to bear on both businesses as well as the unions, it is widely held that the unions are in a good position to go for monthly wage increases rather than just one-off bonus payments. At long last the time has come for labor unions to claw back some of the power that they have let slip through their fingers over past years. Yet again, or so they say. Is any of this true? Are we about to see union power on the rise again? Would that it were so. Yet the reality seems to be far from the case. Even if the large unions manage to secure some wage increases for regular employees of large corporations, that is not going to help alleviate the economic difficulties faced by the irregular working poor. Indeed if companies try to compensate for the cost increases they incur by raising full-time employee wages, this is liable to lead to even more greater hardship for workers on part-time contracts. Such a development surely cannot be counted as a triumph for the unions. Shunto is a word that held meaning and resonance when all working people were permanent employees on company payrolls. Under those circumstances labor unions could say that they were campaigning for workers’ rights merely by negotiating wage increases. That is no longer so. Indeed mere wage bargaining has never really been the basic function of labor unions. That is really not what labor unions are for. Their single most important function is to stand up for workers’ basic human rights. To the extent that securing wage increases for the salarymen of big businesses helped that cause, that was fine. But the world is a very different place now. Somewhere along the line, labor unions seem to have left behind their role as upholders of human rights and the labor movement. Labor unions that do not engage in the labor movement are a strange species of being indeed. Unless and until they start to remember what they really stand for, there is not a hope in a million that the return of the shunto will make any meaningful difference. It is very odd that unionization rates should be falling at a time when the poverty rate is rising and less and less people are able to secure decent wages in Japan. Now, if at any time, unions should come to the fore as defenders of the working poor. The shunto ought to be fought for all working people. And all working people is an increasingly nonuniform concept in the Japan of today. Shunto is not just about economic point scoring, it is about the right to live. Unions should be united in that awareness. Noriko Hama is an economist and a professor at Doshisha University Graduate School of Business.",

    "source": "Tokyo Station's iconic brick building, witness to war, stands test of time <eos> Approaching its 100th anniversary in December, the red brick building of JR Tokyo Station in the Marunouchi business district is a symbol of the capital that continues to defy the high-rises around it with its classical architecture and stately appearance. The huge terminal, where trains arrive and depart 4,100 times a day, witnessed the war and Tokyo’s modernization and remains one of its main landmarks. Stretching 335 meters north to south, the station building is one of the biggest in the world. It has a symmetrical design, with identically shaped wings flanking its entrance, which was constructed for the Imperial family. Each wing has passenger entrance halls crowned with domes, and their walls are adorned with red bricks punctuated by white bands. The majestic appearance of the building is said to stem from late 19th century designs that were popular in Britain. Japan’s first railway started in 1872 as a line connecting the Shinbashi district with Yokohama. Forty years later, the Meiji government initiated a project to build an intermediary station in the capital. Construction took 6½ years, and the red brick building itself was completed in 1914. The structure is a masterpiece by Kingo Tatsuno, who is called the father of modern Japanese architecture and designed prominent buildings during the Meiji (1868-1912) and Taisho (1912-1926) eras, including the Bank of Japan’s headquarters, completed in 1896. The sturdy structure, built with the leading-edge technology of the day, survived the magnitude-7.9 Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 with little damage. But even such a strong building couldn’t escape the ravages of World War II unscathed. In 1945, just a few months before the war’s end, a firebombing campaign by the United States destroyed much of the top, third floor and the domes. The building was renovated after the war, but a shortage of resources forced it to be rebuilt as a two-floor structure with the domes replaced by eight-cornered roofs, an appearance that would be retained for some 60 years. Currently, much of the brick building is composed of offices for railway operations, but about half is occupied by the Tokyo Station Hotel, which opened a year after the station opened for business and has been used to accommodate many state guests and well-known authors. Among the most notable guests were late novelist Yasunari Kawabata (1899-1972), a Nobel laureate in literature, and Hyakken Uchida (1889-1971), another renowned author and academic. Both were known to have written some of their works while staying at the hotel. Acclaimed writer Seicho Matsumoto (1909-1992), whose works include the 1958 detective novel “Ten to Sen” (“Points and Lines”), is another celebrity who is said to have loved the hotel, particularly for the view it provided of the railway tracks. In 1987, the historic building faced a crisis when a plan was hatched to replace it with a modern high-rise. But citizens stood up for its preservation, causing the plan to be altered to include the restoration of its original design and reinforcement against earthquakes. The building was thus restored in a five-year project that included reconstruction of the third floor lost 67 years before. Thanks to the completion of a new in-station facility that includes restaurants and shops, the building has become a popular tourist spot. To mark the building’s centenary, East Japan Railway Co. (JR East) plans to hold several commemorative events that include decorating train cars with a red brick motif and a special exhibition in the station’s gallery explaining the building’s history. In December, the red brick building will be illuminated in “fancy colors” to spark the celebratory spirit. The interiors of the domes that adorn JR Tokyo Station were recently refurbished. | SATOKO KAWASAKI Tourists walk past the front of the JR Tokyo Station building in the Marunouchi business district. | SATOKO KAWASAKI Parts of the landmark building can be viewed from windows in The Tokyo Station Hotel. | SATOKO KAWASAKI A child looks at a large, glass-covered silver bell that has become a popular meeting spot in JR Tokyo Station. | SATOKO KAWASAKI An old brick wall saved from the renovation of the Tokyo Station building is shown on public display.

    "source": "Kyoto widow held over spouse's death may be a serial husband killer <eos> KYOTO - Suspicion is mounting that a Kyoto Prefecture woman under arrest for allegedly killing her husband may have also killed previous spouses and lovers. Chisako Kakehi, 67, was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of murdering Isao Kakehi, 75, who died last December in his home in Muko, Kyoto Prefecture. The Kyoto Prefectural Police found traces of cyanide in his body. Investigators said they also detected a trace of cyanide in personal belongings that Chisako Kakehi disposed of, and suspect she used the poisonous substance to kill her husband. They are searching to determine how she obtained the cyanide. She has denied the allegation. Police quoted her as saying, “I absolutely didn’t kill (my husband).” Despite Kakehi’s denial, mysterious deaths surround her. Investigative sources said Thursday they have found empty medicine capsules and thin papers for taking medicinal powder in a separate residence she maintains in Sakai, Osaka Prefecture. The police suspect she may have used them to wrap cyanide or laced food with the substance so that her husband would not notice the poison. They said they also found several books on medicine in the home. The sources said Kakehi tried to buy sleeping pills for her husband at a drug store before his death in late December, but eventually bought Chinese herbs with similar effects because she did not have a prescription for the pills. The police suspect that she had the husband take the Chinese herbs, followed by a capsule of cyanide. Kakehi is believed to have been married four times. The police said that in addition to her latest husband, five men in Osaka, Hyogo and Nara prefectures related to her have died since 2006. All four of the husbands and the two men she was dating died several years after they married her or became acquainted with her, they said. She is believed to have inherited assets totaling more than ¥100 million from the deaths. Police have already found a trace of cyanide in the body of a 71-year-old man in Kaizuka, Osaka Prefecture, who died in March 2012. They allege the man had a close relationship with Kakehi and are trying to determine how he died. Investigators say the man fell down on a road in Izumisano, Osaka Prefecture while he was riding a small motorcycle and subsequently died. Heart failure was blamed, but after Isao Kakehi’s suspicious death, police re-examined a blood sample taken from the Kaizuka man and found traces of cyanide. They suspect she induced Isao to take cyanide on Dec. 28. He he died that day at about 9 p.m. The police suspect Chisako Kakehi induced her latest husband, Isao Kakehi, to take cyanide at home in a yet-to-be determined method last Dec. 28, causing him to die at about 9 p.m. that day. According to Chisako Kakehi’s account to the police, she found him collapsed near the entrance to the room, and she called for an ambulance about 50 minutes later. The police detected an amount of cyanide far exceeding a fatal dose in his stomach and blood but did not find any traces around his mouth. This has led the police to believe Chisako Kakehi may have tricked him into ingesting the cyanide without being aware of it. After they started to search various locations, one of her acquaintances said she may commit suicide. The police arrested her on Wednesday morning.",

Guinness World Records on Friday confirmed that the 120 km of multicolored wire strung in the shape of three interconnected giant, wrapped Christmas gifts in a downtown Canberra mall was the largest ever image made of LED lights. Lawyer David Richards assembled the Canberra light show with the help of an army of volunteers and powers it with electricity donated by a local power company. He set a Guinness World Record a year ago for the most Christmas lights on a residential property by cocooning his Canberra home with 502,165 bulbs. However, traffic snarls in his neighborhood created by 75,000 sightseers who visited the display over four weeks made it difficult for his family to get to and from their home. “I couldn’t do it again to my neighbors or my family,” Richards said, explaining the move to the city center. The latest light show will be open to the public free of charge from Friday until New Year’s Eve. Visitors to the 2013 light show donated 138,000 Australian dollars ($117,000) to a local Canberra Sudden Infant Death Syndrome counselling and support service. Richards said he expects donations to the SIDS and Kids ACT charity will be higher with the bigger and more spacious display.

    "source": "Are Japan's public school teachers paid too much? <eos> Last month the Ministry of Finance presented a policy recommendation based on studies made by an advisory group. Such recommendations are fairly common, but this one caught more than the usual amount of attention because of where it was directed. The ministry thinks that the maximum class size for first year elementary school students should be increased from 35 to 40 . In purely economic terms, such a change would result in a reduction of as many as 4,000 teachers, which would translate as ¥8.6 billion in savings for the central government alone. However, the ministry’s explanation for why the change should be implemented was not made in fiscal terms. It was made in educational terms. Until the Democratic Party of Japan became the ruling party, maximum class size was 40, and the DPJ changed it to 35 in order to address the bullying problem. But the finance ministry says that bullying incidents have increased slightly since class sizes were reduced, so obviously it has had no effect. Obviously, this sounds more like something the education ministry should tackle, and, predictably, the education ministry objects to the recommendation, saying that increasing class number back to 40 runs counter to world trends , which favor smaller class sizes so that students can get more individual attention from teachers. The finance ministry has countered the objection by saying that the money saved by increasing class size can be spent on “pre-schoolers,” since the education ministry is now promoting tuition-free pre-schools for some households but have no budget for it. As several other media have pointed out, the finance ministry isn’t really interested in education programs. It is simply moving the money from one area to another. It’s a matter of bookkeeping. The ministry’s justification for cutting teachers is also problematic. It says that Japanese public school teachers’ salaries are higher than they are in other countries, which is a conveniently misleading truth. The salary of a median age 45-year-old full-time public school teacher in Japan is about ¥7 million, though a 2010 OECD survey found that Japanese teachers made on average the equivalent of $44,337 a year, which is $7,000 more than the OECD average. That’s probably what the finance ministry is talking about. What the ministry doesn’t mention is that this average salary was 8.6 percent less than it was in 2000, which is perhaps a reflection of the fact that more teachers are now non-regular part-timers . Moreover, as a percentage of total public spending on education, teachers’ pay in Japan is higher than it is in other developed countries — 86 percent compared to 81 percent in the U.S. and 67 percent in the U.K. — and as a portion of GDP Japan’s spending on education is the lowest of the 31 OECD countries, and has been for five years running. But the most significant statistic is work load . The average number of hours worked by a teacher in OECD countries is 39 a week, 20 of which are spent actually teaching. In Japan it’s 52 and 19 , respectively. Also, unlike in the U.S., where teachers can get two months off due to summer vacation, Japanese teachers have no time off other than mandatory paid vacation, which means when school is out they are required to show up for work. And Japanese public school teachers do not get paid overtime. Consequently, the finance ministry’s various justifications for increasing class size seems disingenuous, but they will probably play well with local governments, which pay two-thirds of education costs and stand to save more if class sizes are increased. However, it should be noted that in the larger scheme of things, class size reduction was never much of a policy. The DPJ wanted to reduce class sizes for all grades of elementary and junior high school, but it became fiscally and politically unfeasible, and so they limited the decrease to only Grade 1, with the hope that later they could extend it to upper grades. But then the Liberal Democratic Party regained power. As the Asahi Shimbun pointed out in an editorial, the policy has only been in place for three years, so it’s too early to judge its effects, either on bullying or on the quality of education in general. Since enrollment is dropping, the number of teachers will also naturally drop due to attrition. Basically, the finance ministry wants to cut expenditures and sees education as the easiest way to do it by resorting to “bureaucratic hocus-pocus,” as one part-time teacher put it in a letter to Tokyo Shimbun.",

    "source": "Italian mobsters take secret oath in police video <eos> ROME - Recruits for Italy’s ‘ndrangheta crime syndicate have been caught on video taking a loyalty oath, swearing “under the splendor of the moon,” in a ceremony secretly recorded by police in what investigators called authorities’ first such glimpse of the ritual. Carabinieri paramilitary police in Milan on Tuesday released video of what they said were two “convivial” get-togethers of suspected mobsters at a farmhouse in Castello di Brianza, northern Italy, with one recruit as young as 17. The oath reminds the recruits that traitors are expected to kill themselves and to keep an extra bullet handy in case it comes to that. Investigators didn’t explain how they managed to film at the ceremony. Prosecutors said it was the first time authorities have obtained video of an ‘ndrangheta initiation ritual. The same investigation led to 38 arrests. The probe concentrated on loans mobsters made to businesses in northern Italy and Switzerland that were unable to get credit otherwise. In a separate intercepted phone call, one suspect says to tell someone reluctant to repay money: “I will cut his head off.'” Milan prosecutor Ilda Boccassini said the video shows how “the force of tradition” helps the ‘ndrangheta, a global cocaine trafficking organization, to thrive. Suspected mobsters are seen kissing each other on the cheek in greeting. The ‘ndrangheta, rooted in the southern Calabrian region, has spread north as it invested illicit revenues. In another scene, four males huddle together as words of a loyalty oath are repeated. “Right in this holy evening, in the silence of the night, under the light of the stars and under the splendor of the moon, I create the holy chain … the holy society,” one man says.",

The party also took aim at Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s “Abenomics” policy package of monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and a pro-growth reforms, saying it has caused the country’s income gap to widen and the economy to worsen. As alternatives to raising the spending tax to 10 percent from the current 8 percent, it offered to increase taxes on the wealthy and big companies, and cut spending on wasteful public works projects. The party also reiterated its anti-nuclear stance. The JCP expressed opposition to ongoing talks on a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that would create a free trade area among Pacific Rim countries, and to the secrecy law that will impose tougher penalties on leakers of state secrets as a way to bolster information protection. The law is set to take effect Dec. 10. On other contentious issues, the opposition party said it would “retract” a Cabinet decision in July to reinterpret the pacifist Constitution to enable the use of the right to collective self-defense, and will unconditionally remove U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Okinawa Prefecture. Abe is promoting the relocation of the base to the Henoko district of Nago from a densely populated area in Ginowan, both in Okinawa, which hosts the bulk of U.S. military installations in Japan.",

Men dressed as an Edo wanderer (left) and a ‘kawaraban’ (handbill) peddler pose at the Edo Fuzoku Gyoretsu (Edo Culture Parade) near the former Tokaido Road between the Yatsuyama and Aomonoyokocho districts in Tokyo’s Shinagawa Ward on Sept. 28. | YOSHIAKI MIURA Shinagawa prospered as the gateway to Edo, as Tokyo was then known, with both visitors and westbound travelers stopping there to rest and buy supplies. At the time, the area was said to have 7,000 residents and 1,600 homes. Even today, traces of Shinagawa’s early prosperity can be seen in its cityscape. To help preserve and pass on its traditions, a special 2-km parade was launched between the Minami-Shinagawa and Aomonoyokocho neighborhoods in late September. Women immaculately dressed as “oiran” (high-class prostitutes and courtesans), caught spectators’ eyes while others decked out as merchants, policemen and townsfolk from the period depicted its rich history. Today, Shinagawa is a place where old meets new. Visitors can deviate from the old Tokaido road near Keikyu Railway’s Kita-Shinagawa Station by walking along a street south of it that will show how close Shinagawa once stood to the coastline before additional land was reclaimed from Tokyo Bay. Historical evidence of this can be seen in old houses facing a canal where several “yakatabune” party boats are docked. The houses contrast heavily with several modern buildings nearby. Another historic spot is the Kujirazuka (whale mound) where the remains of a 16.5-meter whale were buried after it created a stir by beaching itself one stormy day in 1798, documents say. Shinagawa evolved into a major train station during the modernization drive of the Meiji Era that began in 1868. Shinagawa, now a crucial link to both Haneda and Narita airports, will likely see its role as international gateway grow ahead of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.

Mr. Mackenzie, while in Japan in the same capacity, learned to hate the words sō desu ka ( Is that so?). Applying to the military authorities for permission to go to the front, the staff officer in charge says, sō desu ka! Day after day passes on without any news, and he goes to the same office to hurry them up, but only the same word is repeated by the same party. I can’t wait any longer — sō desu ka. Please try and let me go at once — sō desu ka. What are you going to do for me after all? — sō desu ka. I must say goodbye to you, then — sō desu ka! Certainly that was the most tantalizing phrase in the whole world, he says. And Mr. Sugimura in great sympathy but without thinking of it says, “sō desu ka!” — much to the disgust of his host. 75 YEARS AGO Monday, Nov. 27, 1939 Fourteenth Dalai Lama installed in Tibet A living “baby” Buddha now accepting homage from the 2 million people he will rule till death, and believed by his followers to have the same soul possessed by the ruler who preceded him, is the subject of a strange story being unfolded in fragmentary news from Tibet. “The small boy in knee-boots and yellow robes, recently installed in Lhasa’s hilltop palace, is Tibet’s 14th Dalai Lama, just identified after more than five years of search for the thirteenth Lama’s successor,” says a bulletin from the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the National Geographic Society. “Until he reaches his majority, regents will rule in his name.” “Tibet, secluded between the world’s highest mountain barriers and the gloomiest windswept desert of Asia, is one of the last theocracies surviving in the modern world. The Dalai Lama, head of both church and state, is acclaimed as a living embodiment of Buddha. His succession is determined by no commonplace father-and-son hereditary arrangement, but by the principle of reincarnation. When a Dalai Lama dies, oracles fall into trances for guidance, and priests search the country for a boy born at the instant of the ruler’s death. The spirit of the former Dalai Lama is accepted as having entered the baby, who thereupon becomes ruler of a land one-sixth as large as the United States, and head of a priesthood numbering between one-fifth and one-seventh of the entire population. The young Dalai Lama referred to is Tenzin Gyatso, who continues to hold the position today. 50 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Nov. 10, 1964 Ikeda picks Sato to be next prime minister Ailing Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda picked former State Minister Eisaku Sato as the man to succeed him Monday morning. The verdict, in the form of a message addressed to a general meeting of Liberal-Democratic members of both Houses of the Diet, was entrusted to two Tory president-makers at the National Cancer Center at Tsukiji, Tokyo, where Ikeda is receiving treatment for cancer. Ikeda handed the message to Tory Vice President Shojiro Kawashima and Secretary General Takeo Miki immediately after they briefed him on their latest round of negotiations to single out his successor. Kawashima and Miki read the message at the Dietmen’s caucus held in the Diet building hours later. The caucus then voted on Ikeda’s recommendation. In a brief address to the party caucus, Sato said he fully realized the gravity of his new duties as well as that of the situation both in and outside of Japan. He pledged his efforts to further strengthen Tory unity and resolutely tackle his political tasks. He then solicited massive Tory support for this endeavor. Ikeda had announced his resignation, due to ongoing cancer treatment, the day after the closing ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics. He died on Aug. 13, 1965. 25 YEARS AGO Saturday, Nov. 4, 1989 Shibuya police box is top lender nationwide The police box in front of Shibuya Station, besides being one of the busiest in Tokyo, is the top money lender among Japanese police boxes. When people in Shibuya spend more than their budgets allow, or lose their purse or wallet, they come to this police box to borrow enough money to get home. Last year, 2,925 loans totaling ¥753,858 were recorded by Shibuya police. The average loan was about ¥257. “We have a budget for it. The budget is mainly based on how much we gave out the year before,” said Shiro Sakurai, the station chief. “When people come to borrow money, we usually ask them to show us their IDs, but even if they don’t have IDs with them we lend them money sometimes,” another policeman said. “From our experience, we can usually tell if a person is reliable or not. “But there are people who take advantage of our system. They borrow money from several police boxes and disappear,” he added. Loans are also provided to those who are injured or do not have enough money to go home because they have lost their way, as well as those who left home without money. “The appearance of the borrowers is not a factor in our decision to lend them money or not,” the officer said. “We don’t discriminate against them. Also, we have never had foreigners asking to borrow money,” the officer said. “But if they come, we’ll lend them money, too. “We can lend as much as ¥1,000 at a time,” he added. “More than that, we have to get permission from our superior.” The police box money-lending policy is still in effect today.",

    "source": "Chinese tourists step up for Abe as Japanese tighten belts <eos> When Jingyan Hou made her first trip to Japan in 1997, the office worker from Beijing spent ¥200,000 during a weeklong stay on accommodations, meals, transport and souvenirs. On her second visit this year, she spent that much on just one Louis Vuitton handbag in Tokyo’s Ginza shopping district. The increasing wealth of travelers like Hou, 45, underscores the opportunity for Japan to expand its tourism industry as China’s burgeoning middle class goes on vacations abroad. The yen’s slump to a seven-year low against the dollar is also broadening the country’s appeal globally and bolstering the Abe administration’s effort to double visitors by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. “There’s a lot of room to boost the number of foreign tourists coming to Japan with these growing economies in our neighborhood,” said Daiki Takahashi, an economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo. “They’ll have a big impact if the current trend continues.” While Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s growth strategy faces opposition on many fronts — from farmers fighting tariff cuts to corporations against outsiders on their boards — fostering tourism has few detractors. It is a bright spot in an economy that dropped into recession last quarter as consumers cut spending after the government increased the consumption tax in April to help rein in the world’s biggest debt burden. Foreign visitors spent ¥1.5 trillion in Japan in the nine months through September, more than all of 2013, according to the Japan Tourism Agency. Money from inbound tourists is on course to surpass spending by Japanese travelers overseas next year for the first time in at least three decades, said Takahashi. Hou is doing her part, spending about ¥1 million over a week in October, half of it on shopping. “I can get more stylish products in Japan than what I can find back in China,” she said, with shopping bags in each hand at the Mitsukoshi department store in Ginza. Her purchases ranged from clothes and accessories to cosmetics and Pokemon figures. Chinese tourists are now the world’s top spenders, forking out $129 billion in 2013, World Tourism Organization figures show. Around 2 million mainlanders visited Japan in the first 10 months of 2014, more than double the number from 2006, according to the Japan Tourism Agency. And yet for visitors to Japan, they remain behind South Koreans and Taiwanese. In all, more than 10 million foreigners traveled to the third-largest economy last year. While the Japanese economy has struggled after the consumption tax bump in April and the yen has slumped 12 percent, duty-free sales at Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd.’s Ginza outlet have almost doubled compared with the same period a year ago, said Kayo Yoshida, one of its customer service managers. Mitsukoshi nearly tripled bilingual sales assistants at its Ginza store to 21 this year and is expanding its range of duty free products, Yoshida said. As Abe seeks to revitalize regional areas, Japan is also attracting foreign tourists to destinations outside the well-trodden corridor from Tokyo to Mount Fuji and on to Kyoto. The city of Sakaiminato, Tottori Prefecture, population 36,000, is one of the beneficiaries. The port is rebuilding some of the older infrastructure at its harbor as tourists visiting on cruise ships increase to a projected 16,000 this year. On one day last month, 3,600 Chinese visitors disembarked from a liner, boarded 100 buses and set out sightseeing and shopping, said Tsuyoshi Furuhashi, a spokesman at the local tourism association. “We need to attract tourists like this as our population declines in Japan,” Furuhashi said. Japan lowered the minimum income requirements for Chinese seeking tourist visas in 2010 and might extend the use of multiple-entry visas to the whole country rather than just Okinawa, as it is now, according to the Foreign Ministry. Indian tourists became eligible for multiple-entry visas for short sightseeing stays in July and waivers are in place for people from Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. While Japan is well rated for customer service, transport and cultural attractions, it has a reputation for expensive accommodations. Manryo Inc., the operator of nine hostels for foreign tourists in Tokyo and Kyoto, has found one solution for visitors trying to keep lodging costs low. Three of its hostels are former love hotels. Manryo’s hostel in Tokyo’s Asakusa district offers its cheapest rooms at ¥2,200 per day, versus about ¥5,500 to ¥10,000 for a business hotel. “We had only 350,000 foreign tourists when Japan hosted the Olympics for the first time in 1964,” said Masataka Ota, chief consultant at Japan Tourism Marketing Co. “It’s amazing to think we may have 20 million next time.”",

    "source": "LDP incumbents look to have electoral lock on nation's nuclear heartland <eos> OSAKA - Political decisions over the fate of Fukui’s aging reactors have long been in the hands of powerful pro-nuclear Diet members who represent the prefecture. The Dec. 14 poll is not expected to change that, although it will be the first in which only two Fukui Lower House members are up for re-election. The loss of one seat stems from electoral district reforms that went into effect last year. Currently, the prefecture has three districts. The No. 1 district, which mostly encompasses the city of Fukui in the north of the prefecture, is represented by Tomomi Inada, a right-wing Liberal Democratic Party policy chief and close ideological confidant of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The No. 2 district includes the inland town of Ono on the eastern flank of the prefecture, as well as municipalities just north of the city of Fukui on the border with Ishikawa. It’s represented by Taku Yamamoto, also of the LDP and the husband of internal affairs minister Sanae Takaichi, another close right-wing Abe confidant. Fukui No. 3 is the nuclear power district. It includes the towns of Tsuruga, home to two reactors, one of which is 44 years old; Mihama, which hosts three reactors, two of them over 40 years old; Oi, where there are four reactors, two in excess of 35 years old; and Akahama, two of whose four reactors are, or soon will be, 40 years old. The No. 3 district is represented by the LDP’s Tsuyoshi Takagi, who appears to be less of an ideologue than Inada, although he once lent his support to a film denying the occurrence of the Rape of Nanking. But more importantly for local pro-nuclear voters and Kansai Electric Power Co., which operates the above reactors, Takagi has always been a fierce supporter of atomic energy and played an influential Diet role in getting two of the Oi reactors restarted in 2012 despite nationwide opposition. Those units were shut down for inspection last year. For the coming election, however, Fukui will have only two districts. The first is a nonnuclear zone, incorporating the city of Fukui and the towns in the north. The other covers the middle and southern part of the prefecture, where all of the nuclear plants are located, near the borders of Shiga and Kyoto prefectures. The LDP has been weighing a plan to field Inada in the first district, Takagi in the second, and Yamamoto as a proportional representation candidate. As of late last week, discussions were ongoing. At the moment, none of the opposition parties has announced any candidates. In the 2012 Lower House election, Takagi won the No. 3 district by nearly 50,000 votes against his Democratic Party of Japan rival, who ran on a mildly anti-nuclear platform. How Takagi will fare under the revised districts is uncertain. But unless strong anti-nuclear candidates emerge in the coming days, it appears Takagi, Inada and Yamamoto will continue to represent Fukui in Diet deliberations over the prefecture’s old atomic plants for years to come.",

    "source": "Kepco weighs new lease of life for geriatric reactors <eos> In a decision that will set a precedent for Japan’s rapidly aging nuclear reactors, Kansai Electric Power Co. must soon choose whether to restart reactors 1 and 2 at its Takahama plant in Fukui Prefecture and operate them beyond the 40-year threshold, the first time a Japanese utility has faced such a dilemma. Under new government guidelines adopted in 2012, 40 years is the maximum limit, in principle, on how long the nation’s reactors are allowed to operate. After that, they are supposed to be decommissioned, a process that can take decades. However, if a utility decides to continue to use them, it can apply for a one-time-only extension of 20 years if it meets a series of additional safety tests the government describes as “stringent.” Currently, all of Japan’s 48 commercial reactors are idled. To apply for a two-decade extension on those now at or close age 40, their operators have to apply for special government inspections by no later than next July. These checks will be more expensive than the inspections currently being carried out on younger reactors. Of Fukui’s 13 commercial reactors, 11 of which are operated by Kansai Electric, five are, or soon will be, at the 40-year limit. Another three are over 35 years old, and the utility will have to decide their fate in the next few years. The two Takahama reactors went into operation in November 1974 and November 1975, with a capacity of 826,000 kilowatts each. Earlier this month, Kansai Electric President Makoto Yagi said the utility would consider whether to decommission units based on whether they could still turn a profit if granted a 20-year extension. But Fukui politicians have cautioned the company to think about more than just the bottom line. “What’s important is to think about plant operation and decommissioning at the same time. Local governments, as well as utilities, have to check the decommissioning process and this will require funding,” Fukui Gov. Issei Nishikawa said last month. “Where will midterm storage facilities be built? Where will a final storage facility for the spent fuel and nuclear waste be located? It’s necessary for the central government to be deeply involved.” In September, Fukui Vice Gov. Tatsuji Sugimoto warned Kansai Electric Vice President Shigeki Iwane that “if you’re going to discuss decommissioning, you won’t get anywhere unless you treat finding a midterm storage facility for the spent fuel, the problem of disposing of nuclear contaminated materials, and how decommissioning will impact the local economy as one set of issues.” Decommissioning is of special concern to Fukui because it threatens the state subsidies that have been flowing into the prefecture for four decades. Between the 2007 and 2012 fiscal years, Fukui received at least ¥20 billion annually. From 1974 to 2012, prefectural data show Fukui received about ¥390 billion under three laws designed to reward local governments if they agreed to host nuclear plants. Much of this has gone into roads, bridges, dams and other projects that keep the coffers of local construction companies full, provide employment for their workers as well as in local service industries, who then return the money via donations for local and national pro-nuclear lawmakers of the Liberal Democratic Party. But while Kansai Electric, local governments in Fukui, the governor and major corporations in the region support both the restart of the prefecture’s newer reactors and, if possible, extending the Takahama units for another 20 years, at least one survey shows the rest of Kansai appears to be generally fine without nuclear power. The Institute of Nuclear Safety System Inc., established and owned by Kansai Electric in Mihama, Fukui Prefecture, conducted a multiple choice survey last fall on how people in six Kansai prefectures and the southern part of Fukui felt about power generation, especially nuclear energy. The results showed that, despite pressure from the pro-nuclear lobby for reactor restarts and higher electricity bills, 46 percent of the respondents felt either that atomic power should not be used or that other sources of electricity should be tapped. Although another 45 percent believed the use of nuclear energy was “inevitable,” only 8 percent replied it would be a “good” source of power. In addition, the survey indicated that, despite Kansai Electric jacking up its power rates by 10 percent overall in spring 2013, not many of the respondents were overly concerned. “The negative effects of the long-term suspension of nuclear power generation have not been recognized,” said institute official Atsuko Kitada. Then there is a question the survey did not address: to what extent should the rest of Kansai be involved in decisions to restart or extend the operational life of the Fukui reactors. Since the March 2011 Fukushima meltdowns, relations between Fukui and other Kansai prefectures that rely on its nuclear power plants have often been tense. Leaders in neighboring Kyoto and Shiga whose towns lie within a 30-km radius of the Fukui reactors want more of a say in their future. Anti-nuclear groups add that talk of extensions is underway even as the nation has yet to end the crisis at the Fukushima No. 1 plant. “It is particularly unconscionable for the Abe government to open the way for old reactors to operate when the Fukushima accident is ongoing,” said Aileen Mioko Smith of Green Action, a Kyoto-based anti-nuclear lobby. In October, Maizuru, a port city in Kyoto Prefecture that lies less than 10 km from the Takahama plant in Fukui, called for the definition of “local government consent” to be expanded to those municipalities within a 30-km radius of the facility since, by law, they have to draw up evacuation plans in case of a disaster. Around 144,000 people, including Maizuru’s 88,600 residents, live within 30 km of Takahama. But Nishikawa rejects such calls. “I recognize the definition of local consent as meaning Fukui Prefecture and the towns and villages that host the power plants,” he told reporters last month. “Since it’s been those areas closest to the nuclear plants that have borne the greatest risks over the past 40 or 50 years, there is a natural difference between them and other areas (outside Fukui).”",

    "source": "Eels face the slippery slope to extinction <eos> Last week I was crossing the River Thames on the way to work in London, and I happened to see a cormorant emerge from the water with a thrashing eel in its mouth. The bird juggled the fish, skillfully managing to position it so it could swallow the wriggling animal headfirst. While it was a disaster from the eel’s point of view — after all, they can live for up to 20 years before breeding — it was for me quite an encouraging sight. The number of European eels has crashed in recent years, so to see one in the Thames is a good sign. Even if it was being eaten. Eels — whether European or Japanese — are elusive, mysterious creatures. We have eaten them for millenniums, but we still don’t understand the basic details of their reproductive behavior. They spend most of their lives in freshwater rivers, but then migrate in vast numbers, with Japanese eels swimming thousands of kilometers to spawn at an unknown location near Guam and the Mariana Islands. European eels have a similarly mysterious spawning ground somewhere in the Sargasso Sea. That ignorance is now more pressing than ever, as both Japanese and European eels are officially classed as being in danger of extinction. To foodies, unagi (Japanese eels) need no introduction. A famous, cherished national dish, some 100,000 tons of the animal are eaten in Japan each year. (This accounts for around 70 percent of the worldwide consumption.) The “u” of unagi is often written in hiragana on shop signs in the shape of an eel. When I worked at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture, one of my colleagues was famous for his love of eel. He couldn’t wait for Doyo no Ushi no Hi (Midsummer Day of the Ox), the traditional day when eel is consumed, supposedly to counteract the summer heat. But consumption of eel is now year-round, and as a result, supplies are becoming scarce. By some counts, numbers have crashed by around 95 percent from the 1960s. In response, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has now put Japanese eels on its Red List of Threatened Species. People may be becoming aware that the amount of eel being consumed is unsustainable, and even the slow-moving Fisheries Agency might act to protect the animal. What people don’t seem to appreciate, however, is just how mysterious the eel is. “Although our ecological research is often covered by the media and we have public lectures and symposiums, many Japanese people don’t know about much of the mystery of eels,” says eel biologist Mari Kuroki, of the Department of Aquatic Bioscience at the University of Tokyo. Kuroki has written a book for children, “Unagi no U-chan: Daiboken” (“Adventures of U-chan the Eel”), so that they will at least learn of the dangers faced by eels. Foodies may know that the best eels are held to come from Lake Hamana in Shizuoka Prefecture, and some people think this is also where they reproduce. Not so. Eels live for some years in freshwater lakes and brackish estuaries before they mature and become “silver eels.” Then, no longer feeding, the eels start heading out to the ocean. All over East Asia eels leave their rivers and start swimming. They swim for weeks, covering thousands of kilometers. How do they know where to go? How do the baby eels, when they are hatched in the depths of the ocean, get back to freshwater? We don’t know. “The spawning behavior and the spawning migration route still remains a mystery,” says Kuroki. Some facts are known. The baby eels feed on something called marine snow — a shower of dead plants and animals that slowly and continuously drifts down through the ocean. The peculiar nature of this food makes raising baby eels a tricky business. The route of the journey back is unclear. Some part of the route is determined by ocean currents, and some by active swimming. “Overfishing is apparently the main threat,” says Kuroki. Overfishing affects the numbers of young eels that can establish themselves in rivers, because commercial fisheries remove young eels to raise them in farms. But fishing also affects the mature animals — these are caught by fishermen (in the olden days by men using cormorants to catch the eels for them) as the eels migrate back out to sea. “Also, the degradation of the river environment is a serious factor,” she adds. Kuroki and her colleagues are tagging eels with radio transmitters in order to better understand the route taken by these unusual animals. One thing recently discovered about European eels is that they can be eaten by whales. To some extent, eels are at the mercy of ocean currents. And these are known to be changing as the ocean gets warmer as a result of climate change. “The return route to the ocean and the mechanism of adult eel migration is still not well validated,” Kuroki says. “If they use ocean currents, a slight global climate change could have a big influence.” One of the things I love about Japan is how a respect for nature is deeply woven into society, culture and legend. Eels are a prime example. They appear in many rakugo comic stories, and lend themselves to various idioms. And the famous legend of the country being balanced on the back of a catfish, whose wiggling is supposed to account for earthquakes? In some regions the foundation animal is said to be an eel. So in that sense the animal is the literal foundation of the entire country. The species must be preserved!",

    "source": "At Kyoto University, police blitz line of legal protests <eos> On Nov. 4, a man in his 30s stepped onto the grounds of Kyoto University. A couple of days earlier, in Tokyo, two Kyoto University students had been arrested at a demonstration after an alleged scuffle with police. Those arrested were allegedly connected to the radical left-wing group Chukaku-ha (Middle Core Faction). What happened next remains the subject of some dispute. The man was forced to admit that he was a plainclothes police officer and “escorted” by the students to a classroom, where he was detained and questioned by school officials for three hours. Kyoto University was angry that the sanctity of its campus had been violated. Critics warned the incident was yet another sign that Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his right-wing henchmen (and women) was out of control, and that fundamental academic freedoms were being threatened. Then late last week, as if to prove the critics were right, police decked out in full riot gear raided a Kyoto University dormitory as part of the investigation into the students who were arrested in Tokyo. Why call out the riot police? To “prevent confusion,” according to a Jiji Press report. Police forces and college campuses in Japan have a complex relationship. In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled that “the autonomy of a university has traditionally been recognized as a way to guard academic freedom.” This has been interpreted by pretty much everybody as meaning police officers do not have the right to invade a college campus and target students for questioning or surveillance without due cause. In the Kyoto University incident, there was no apparent due cause. Even if there was, the university has an agreement with the police in Kyoto that it be notified in advance before any officer steps foot on campus grounds, and this was not done. Chukaku-ha, an extreme leftist group that has a history of detonating bombs at police stations and firing rockets onto the grounds of Kyoto Imperial Palace, has long been a target of police monitoring. Exact figures are hard to come by. Media reports indicate the group has up to 200 hard-core members and an unknown number of supporters, ranging from the low hundreds to as many as 3,500. It traditionally recruits from the ranks of labor leaders and college students. While some members are violent, official reports tend to hint that Chukaku-ha is just one group among many posing a danger to “public order.” A 19-page document released in January by the Public Security Intelligence Agency includes a section on groups in the public spotlight. It lumps the generally low-profile Chukaku-ha in with all of those who oppose the Futenma base relocation plan for U.S. forces in Okinawa, the deployment of the MV-22 Osprey tilt rotor aircraft to the prefecture, constitutional revision, the state secrets law and the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. The report also has a separate section labeled “extremist” groups, where Chukaku-ha and other “left-wing” groups are again included. Interestingly, another section is labeled only “right-wing groups,” the presumption, one assumes, being that “right-wing” groups are not “extremist.” No doubt Chukaku-ha members are involved with — or, at least, intellectually support — the legal protests mentioned above. As Japanese citizens they have that right. However, readers can be forgiven for wondering if authorities are blurring the line between legal demonstrations by the many with the illegal actions of a few in one group in order to justify their monitoring of anyone they choose, no matter where they are located — including on college campuses.

    "source": "More abandoned dogs reported in three prefectures <eos> Amid a rash of dog abandonment cases across the nation, 80 additional instances have been reported since October 2013 in Saitama, Yamanashi and Saga prefectures, according to local communities and animal welfare groups. Officials in Saitama Prefecture said 46 abandoned dogs of various breeds, mainly small ones including Chihuahuas, were found between October 2013 and July of this year. Eight of the cases involved Chihuahuas abandoned in a single park in the city of Saitama. Seven dogs were discovered in the park on Oct. 27, 2013, two of which were found dead. Between then and July, 31 abandoned dogs were found in the same park, none of which were wearing a collar. “The dogs may have been deliberately disposed of by a breeder,” a prefectural official said. The Saitama Prefectural Police are looking into the cases as possible violations of the Act on Welfare and Management of Animals. On June 2 and June 30, six Chihuahuas were found abandoned near the river that divides the cities of Asaka and Shiki in Saitama Prefecture. The city of Higashimatsuyama, also in Saitama Prefecture, said nine miniature dachshunds were abandoned in July. In Yamanashi Prefecture, as many as 26 mature small breed dogs including Yorkshire terriers were found in the town of Nanbu in March and April. The prefecture said another eight dogs were found roaming the town’s streets earlier in the year. Yamanashi Prefecture launched an investigation and inspected about 100 dog breeders but found no evidence of violations. According to Happy Voice, an animal welfare group based in Saga Prefecture, 18 abandoned Maltese dogs were found in October and November in that prefecture, in addition to an earlier case in which seven dogs were either caught alive or found dead. In some of the cases, people who picked up the animals did not report to local authorities but had taken them in, the group said. On Wednesday, prefectural officials spotted a stray dog, believed to have been abandoned, in a parking lot in Takeo and took it to a shelter.",

    "source": "Two Chilans sentenced for 1974 torture of president's father <eos> SANTIAGO - Two retired Chilean military officers were sentenced to prison Friday for the torture death of the father of President Michelle Bachelet. Judge Mario Carroza ordered Cols. Ramon Caceres Jorquera and Edgar Cevallos Jones to serve three years and two years, respectively, for the 1974 torture of Gen. Alberto Bachelet. The maximum possible sentence was five years. Gen. Bachelet was imprisoned for treason during the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet because he had opposed the coup that ousted socialist President Salvador Allende. The regime also arrested Michelle, who was 23 years old, and her mother, Angela Jeria. The women were tortured in a secret prison for two weeks before they fled into exile. “The fact that the trial ended and the truth that we knew from the start is finally known gives me lots of tranquility,” Jeria told local TV after the judge’s decision. “At the same time, it gives me hope that justice will come for all of those who were held with my husband … and everyone else who suffered torture and repression.” Gen. Bachelet remained loyal to Allende, refusing to endorse the coup of Sept. 11, 1973, even after Allende committed suicide while making his last stand in the bombed-out presidential palace. Court documents say officers held Gen. Bachelet at the Air Force War Academy, keeping him tied and blindfolded, withholding water and ordering him at gunpoint to remain motionless for hours. The stress aggravated the 50-year-old general’s heart problems, causing his death in March 1974. The day before his death, he left a note to his wife saying he had been brutally “softened” by his interrogators. Michelle Bachelet returned from exile in 1979. She became a doctor and rose through the ranks of the Socialist party. Chile transitioned to democracy in 1990. Bachelet was elected to her first term as president in 2006. She then ran the U.N.’s agency for women until she was elected president again last year.",

The article in substance reads as follows: “The (war with Japan) recently entered the stage of ‘inactive confronting’ which proves complete validity of the foresight which was declared at the sixth enlarged plenary session of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held in December last year. We should take advantage of (these circumstances) to prepare ourselves for a counter-offensive. “Regarding the issue of the democratic government, the National People’s Congress should be immediately convoked to enforce genuine democracy. There are some people who talk of ‘plots of the Chinese Communists Party’ in an attempt to prejudice against the party’s progressive theory of resistance, which is (in fact) at the vanguard of the move towards liberation from the Japanese.” Mao Tse-tung, who is in the executive position of the Chinese Communist Party, boldly and straightforwardly declared in the article the communists’ readiness to counteract any attempts to reject the Communist Party and voiced a strict warning against the possibility of separation of the Kuomintang from the Communist Party. 50 YEARS AGO Friday, Oct. 2, 1964 World’s fastest trains inaugurate operations The world’s fastest trains began operations Thursday as the Japanese National Railways’ ¥380,000 million New Tokaido Line opened between Tokyo and Osaka. Opening of the 515-km railroad that connects the two cities in four hours was celebrated in a ceremony Thursday morning at the JNR head office in Marunouchi, Tokyo with the Emperor and Empress in attendance. The Emperor said in a congratulatory speech: “May I express my great pleasure at the inauguration today of the New Tokaido Line that has been completed despite many difficulties. I hope for JNR’s continued efforts for increased transportation capacities and improved safety.” Earlier this morning, the all-electrified New Tokaido Line’s first trains, Hikari No. 1 and 2, left Tokyo and Osaka at 6 a.m. simultaneously after gala ceremonies. The Hikari No. 1, packed with nearly 1,000 people, first hit the maximum speed of 210 kph between Shin-Yokohama and Odawara as passengers cheered. Both the first inbound and outbound trains arrived at their destination at 10 a.m. as scheduled. 50 YEARS AGO Sunday, Oct. 11, 1964 XVIII Olympiad opens with pomp in Tokyo The XVIII Olympiad, the first to be held in Asia, opened Saturday afternoon amid a profusion of pomp and youthful enthusiasm at the National Stadium before an over-capacity crowd of 80,000 spectators. It was a flawlessly executed, color-splashed ceremony under a sparkling blue autumn sky. Eager holders of opening ceremony tickets began to arrive at the stadium hours before the gates opened at 10 a.m. The huge oval was filled by 12:45 p.m., an hour before the ceremony began. Cannons boomed, 10,000 homing pigeons soared above the stadium, a choir sang stirring music specially composed for the Olympiad and the drama of the world’s greatest international athletic event was climaxed by the lighting of the Olympic flame atop the stadium. The Emperor, the patron of the Tokyo Olympic Games, proclaimed the Olympiad open at 2.58 p.m. Before the Emperor read his message, 6,500 athletes and officials from 94 nations, including 18 nations participating in the Olympics for the first time, marched into the stadium. 25 YEARS AGO Sunday, Oct. 8, 1989 Japan ‘greater threat’ to U.S. than Soviet Union It came as a shock to many Japanese to learn through a Newsweek poll, conducted by the Gallup Organization in the U.S., that 52 percent of the 600 people interviewed by telephone on Sept. 28-29 thought “the economic power of Japan” was a “greater threat” to the U.S. than “the military power of the Soviet Union.” The obvious conclusion is that Soviet strongman Mikhail Gorbachev and his cohorts have performed a good job of selling their disarmament promises. At the same time, the emergence of freedom-seekers inside the Soviet Union has been augmented by the movements among the Soviet satellite countries to shake off the Communist Party yoke. But Foreign Office spokesman Taizo Watanabe saw the charges made against Japan in the magazine article to be serious enough to require a comment. He reportedly defined the word “threat” as meaning a combination of an intention to invade and the capability of doing so. Watanabe said it was not a “threat” but rather a “challenge” which Japan was presenting—to produce higher quality goods at better prices for the satisfaction of consumers. This reminds one of the old story about building a better mousetrap and having the world beating a path to your door.",

    "source": "South Korea rumor crackdown jolts social media users <eos> SEOUL - South Korea’s president is cracking down on rumors in cyberspace in a campaign that threatens the popularity of Kakao Talk, the leading social media service in a country with ambitions to become a global technology leader. Prosecutors announced the crackdown two weeks ago after President Park Geun-hye complained about insults directed at her and said false rumors “divided the society.” That rattled users of smartphone-based Kakao Talk used by 35 million of South Korea’s 50 million people. It prompted a surge of interest in a previously little-known German competitor, Telegram. Rankey.com , a research firm, said an estimated 610,000 South Korean smartphone users visited Telegram on Wednesday, a 40-fold increase over Sept. 14, before the crackdown was announced. The company said its estimate was based on a randomly selected group of 60,000 people it follows regularly. On Friday, Telegram was the most downloaded free app in Apple Inc.’s App Store in South Korea. On Google Inc.’s store, Telegram was the No. 2 downloaded free communications app, behind only Kakao Talk. South Korean users left reviews on Telegram saying they left Kakao Talk to seek “asylum.” They asked Telegram to add a Korean language service. The uproar threatens to slow adoption of social media or send South Korean users to foreign services, undercutting government ambitions to build a high-tech “creative economy.” “It will definitely limit the number of new signups, as users opt for services which are not subject to monitoring,” said Jon Bradford, a managing director at startup accelerator TechStars in London. “Any policies that the Korean authorities only impose upon local businesses will damage their competitiveness both at home and abroad.” South Korea is one of the most wired societies, with 85 percent of its people online and 40 million smartphones. The government has promised to step up financial support for tech startups. Kakao Talk’s dilemma echoes criticism of U.S. technology companies following disclosures of widespread government surveillance. Internet and other companies have struggled to reassure users while saying they are legally obligated to cooperate with authorities. Last week, China’s telephone regulator said it approved Apple’s new iPhone 6 for use on Chinese networks after the company promised never to allow other governments secret “backdoor” access to users’ data. In Germany, the consumer privacy regulator of the major city of Hamburg told Google it must obtain Germans’ permission before using information about them to create profiles for email and other services. Park has been sensitive about the Web and social media after her government came under criticism following a ferry sinking in April that killed 300 people, most of them high school students. Yong Hye-in, a 24-year-old college student, complained her friends were targeted for unjustified data collection after she was detained during a protest in May demanding government action over the ferry disaster. She received a notice that her house and her Kakao Talk account had been searched with a court’s approval. Yong was alarmed to find investigators obtained personal information of people she contacted. That included messages, photos and videos and network addresses. “It was an indiscriminate collection of data of people around me,” she said. “They should weigh how much (my friends) were involved in the case.” Jung Jinu, an opposition politician, complained investigators who looked into his role in a protest over the ferry tragedy collected messages and phone numbers from his 3,000 contacts on the service. He said many used Kakao Talk to discuss social, labor and political issues. “It is no different from eavesdropping,” Jung said. Kakao Talk, owned by Daum Kakao, an Internet portal and app developer, denied it gave authorities data of Jung’s friends. But the court warrant that Jung showed said all messages he sent and received between May 1 and June 10 were subject to search. Park ordered the justice ministry last month to investigate unfounded stories in cyberspace. At a Cabinet meeting on Sept. 16, she complained about insults about her and said online rumors have “gone too far and divided the society,” according to the presidential office’s website. Two days later, prosecutors announced the launch of a team to monitor online information. They said anyone who posts or passes on information deemed false will face punishment. They said that for “grave matters,” investigations will begin without waiting for complaints and offending information will be deleted. The Seoul prosecutors’ office did not respond to repeated phone calls seeking comment. News reports say authorities will only monitor public posts on Twitter, Facebook, online forums and Web portals, not private messages exchanged on online messengers. Officials at Kakao Talk said authorities cannot look at users’ messages without a court order. “We are aware of such concerns,” the co-CEO of Daum Kakao, Lee Sirgoo, told reporters on Wednesday. Lee said the company had “top security technology” to prevent leaks and only stored messages for a short time. However, he said, Kakao Talk is “subject to South Korean law” and “when there is a fair execution of law, we cooperate with prosecutors” by handing over information. So far, the potential for users to migrate to Telegram, which has fewer features such as emoticons, or other messaging providers is unclear. Rankey.com ‘s survey showed about 90 percent of users of devices that run Google’s Android, the most popular operating system in South Korea, visited Kakao Talk every day. Only 2 percent launched the Telegram app at least once on Wednesday. Some people say Kakao Talk could protect users by encrypting their data. But the company said it saves messages for up to five days in unencrypted form to allow users to copy them onto multiple devices. Responding to growing surveillance concerns, Kakao Talk said Thursday it would reduce the storage period to three days. Yong, the college student, said she has joined Telegram. She also tries to meet people in person instead of using messengers. But she said too many people still use Kakao Talk, so she cannot stop using it completely.",

    "source": "Parasite museum aside, you won't be saury for visiting Meguro <eos> When Japanese hear the word Meguro, some might recall the old “rakugo” comedy “Meguro no Sanma” (“Meguro’s Saury”), about a samurai lord in the Edo Period who fell in love with the taste of saury, the fish that was considered humble fare for peasants and others on the lower rungs of Japan’s social ladder. In the story, the lord and his men are starving while hunting in an area now occupied by modern Meguro and decided to eat saury grilled in a coarse manner by peasants in a desperate bid to end their hunger. But the taste was so spectacular the lord repeatedly ordered the fish after returning to his castle. But the saury, cooked in a refined manner by servants, never tasted as good, the story goes. Eventually, the lord came to believe that only Meguro’s saury was good, although there was hardly a way to get fresh fish in the inland district. Centuries later, Meguro, now part of central Tokyo, is still famous for saury. Last month, 7,000 saury caught in the Pacific off Iwate Prefecture were shipped in for the annual Meguro saury festival, which sees dozens of vendors grilling the fish over charcoal briquets to serve to visitors for free. Apart from saury, Meguro is also known for Meguro Gajoen, a famed wedding hall that opened in 1931. The hall, designed to embody modern design and traditional beauty, was designated a cultural asset by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. The owner founded the building as a first-class Japanese restaurant, but later added an annex with banquet rooms, guest rooms, a shrine, church and photo studio to create an “all-in-one” hall. If you’d like to add a twist to your visit to Meguro, you may want to take a look at Meguro Parasitological Museum, which touts itself as the world’s only museum of the kind. Unexpectedly, many young couples and girls patronize the museum, which showcases some 60,000 parasite species. One of the main exhibits is an 8.8-m tapeworm. Beside it is a string of the same length placed for comparison. A young man visiting with his girlfriend kept his distance from the worm while she scrutinized it. Two other visitors, Ayumi Goto, 19, and Shizuka Kameda, 20, said they were impressed by the vast collection.",

    "source": "Suicidal cells and the immortal cells of Henrietta Lacks <eos> You may not have heard of Henrietta Lacks — an African-American woman from Baltimore who died of cervical cancer in 1951 — but you have benefited from her. A few months before she died, doctors took tissue from Lacks’ tumor and grew cells from it. The cells grew and grew. They wouldn’t stop growing. Until then, there hadn’t been a “line” of human cells that scientists could test drugs on. Lacks’ cells were perfect. There was huge demand for them, and samples were mailed to labs all around the world for testing. The so-called HeLa cells became one of the most important contributions to medical science ever seen. “They helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia and Parkinson’s disease,” says journalist Rebecca Skloot in her fascinating book, “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.” Skloot’s book is the main reason you may actually have heard of Lacks. You see, her tissue was taken without her knowledge or consent. Nor, after she died, was her family informed that HeLa cells were being used around the world to develop new drugs. A lot of people made a lot of money out of the things they discovered with HeLa cells — but the Lacks family never saw a penny. Skloot’s book became a bestseller, and brought her story to the public’s attention. HeLa cells are still helping scientists to make discoveries. At Kyoto University, Kazuhiro Sakamaki, of the department of animal development and physiology, has used them to investigate a mysterious and seemingly counterintuitive phenomenon: the fact that some cells in our bodies are programmed to die. They don’t die of old age or because they become infected — they die because that is their job. This kind of programmed cell suicide is called apoptosis. By coincidence, this process was first outlined in detail by German developmental biologist Alfred Glucksmann — in 1951, the same year HeLa cells were first cultured. What Sakamaki and his team have done is to investigate how apoptosis evolved. To do so, they looked at a protein called caspase-8, which is a key player in the initiation of cell death. When a cell is ready to die, caspase swings into action. It is like the wrecking ball that knocks down a building that is no longer needed. Sakamaki’s team performed an extensive evolutionary analysis of the protein and found that its role in cell death originated very early in the evolution of life — more than 500 million years ago. Not only that, it is universal: All animals use it in the same way. “It is of great significance that the programmed cell death system is established in simpler animals,” says Sakamaki. To demonstrate this, the team used HeLa cells. They took caspase-8 proteins from a range of different animals and put them into HeLa cells. They showed that programmed cell death still occurred, even with proteins from fish and other more “primitive” animals. It may even be the same in insects. “Our study suggests that caspase-8 may be involved in apoptosis in invertebrates as well as vertebrates,” says Sakamaki. His work is published this week in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution. But why should cells be required to commit suicide? Well, in many cases tissue that grows for one reason is no longer required. When we are in the womb, our fingers and toes are joined together, like a duck’s webbed feet. Apoptosis ensures that the webbing joining our digits breaks down, leaving us with separate fingers and toes. In the brain, there are millions upon millions of unwanted cells — these kill themselves off during development in the womb and in early years. And when a woman menstruates, apoptosis is the process that causes the womb lining to shed. Controlled apoptosis is an ability scientists would dearly love to master. Sometimes cells commit suicide when they shouldn’t — this happens in AIDS patients, and with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease too. On the other hand, sometimes it doesn’t work when it should — cells grow out of control. This is a hallmark of cancer. And that, remember, is what killed Henrietta Lacks. Back in the 1950s, doctors didn’t consider such things as informed consent. They took tissue from Lacks, and when it proved useful, they used it. HeLa cells have been used in more than 70,000 studies. But that’s not to say things are completely different today. Last year, Lacks’ genome was sequenced and the results published, without anyone asking the consent of her family. This was a violation of their privacy, because Lacks’ descendants obviously share her genes, so making them public would allow strangers to assess their genetic health. The National Institutes of Health in the United States finally invited the Lacks family in for consultation. Now they are closely involved in helping communicate to the public how science is done. So it’s somehow fitting that Sakamaki used Lacks’ cells to help investigate the process that was involved in her death.",

    "source": "Osaka looks to swim with the 'whales' in casino bid <eos> Osaka faces a challenge: What to do about the whales? No, there’s nothing the International Whaling Commission can do and don’t bother calling Greenpeace or Sea Shepherd, for catching these whales is a form of hunting far more difficult than firing harpoons into a leviathan. In the gambling industry, “whales” generally refers to the high rollers. The top whales — the Moby Dicks, if you will — are the ones who blow into town on private jets, rent the top suites in the best hotels, run up a bar bill greater than the GDP of several developing nations, and shop until they drop at the plethora of Italian and French fashion houses near the casino. You can catch a glimpse of them in the roped-off VIP room, reeking of expensive cologne and dressed like George Clooney or Julia Roberts, sipping a glass of premium Champagne or a 1963 Warre vintage port and placing large amounts of money on a single bet. Without whales, a casino can earn a reputation as being a dull backwater full of “sardines.” You know the type — rubes in loud polyester clothing, traveling on a cheap package tour, and hoping they’ll get lucky at the ¥100 slot machines and win enough money to visit a fancy restaurant, the kind where napkins are made of linen and the utensils are metal, not plastic. Which brings us to Osaka. Japan continues to debate whether to allow legalized gambling. In Osaka, however, the pro-casino lobby (the “sharks”) is looking ahead to what kind of customers might patronize a local casino. There is a gleam in the eyes of politicians convinced that if they build it, customers — especially whales — will come. Particularly Chinese whales, which raises a number of questions. Current plans call for a casino resort on Yumeshima, a man-made island in Osaka harbor, a good distance from the nearest airports. The city hopes Chinese gamblers will make a good percentage of the customer base. But will high-end customers fly into Kansai or Itami airports on their private jets and endure a one-hour ride (or more) through city traffic just to play at a casino? Of course, they could go by helicopter, but is the trip to Osaka itself worth it? The second question is about casino service. The push to legalize “integrated resorts” — a cluster of hotels, convention centers and gambling halls — is supported by politically connected firms that manufacture slot machines used overseas. Whales, however, tend to prefer lower-tech games that have a much higher payoff. That requires card dealers, dice rollers, employees and managers who are linguistically and culturally fluent in the needs of their customers. If Osaka’s casino ends up being slot-machine heavy and its mentality is more tailored toward herding the sardines than in catering to the whales, problems will arise. Finally, there’s the question of location. Past commentators have suggested Kansai airport, in southern Osaka Prefecture, rather than Yumeshima would be a more profitable venue for a casino resort. For drawing foreign whales, who want to fly in and out quickly, that might be the case. However that would also mean less revenue for the city of Osaka. Last week, it was announced Japan might ease requirements for issuing multiple-entry visas to wealthy Chinese. This is a clear message to Chinese high-end gamblers that Japanese casinos, should they come into being, want their business. However, Osaka politicians have yet to show, through detailed, unbiased marketing research, that their plans to catch wealthy Chinese or other whales, or even sardines, are based on something other than a shark-like grin of confidence. Until they do, Osaka voters and gambling opponents will always smell something fishy about official assurances a casino will turn a profit.

    "source": "Abe's shift to regional woes fails to erase mistrust in LDP <eos> Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is putting priority on his new policy of rejuvenating the stalled economies of regions outside Tokyo, many of which are stuck in long-term slumps and suffering from rapid depopulation. Abe plans to draw up a road map by the end of the year for tackling rural depopulation through 2020. His government also intends to set up a special fund that can be flexibly used by stagnant municipalities. But the new initiative is being panned by experts and former bureaucrats from the areas, who say the plan just looks like another half-baked economic initiative from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. LDP-led governments have injected trillions of yen into gigantic public work projects to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure over some five decades of nearly uninterrupted rule, but the party’s traditional emphasis on public works has failed to stop the long-term decline underway outside Tokyo, Osaka and other big cities. Hundreds of towns, villages and smaller cities are considered by experts to be on the verge of “extinction.” “Basically it’s good to emphasize the promotion of provincial economies . . . but (the government) should be extremely careful about implementation,” said Takao Komine, an economics professor at Hosei University who was formerly a senior official in the now-defunct Economic Planning Agency. “Otherwise, it will just repeat the (LDP’s) past failures,” Komine warned. Komine argued it’s impossible to save all of the towns in decline nationwide. The Abe administration should thus concentrate on investing public funds in certain “core cities” — an extremely difficult political task. “You can’t save everybody. It’d be very difficult to choose which municipalities to concentrate on,” Komine said. “If you follow the past pattern, it would just mean scattering money around.” He was referring to the LDP’s reputation for relying on pork-barrel politics in rural areas. One of the most notorious cases was Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita’s Hometown Creation initiative in 1988 and 1989, which doled out ¥100 million each to about 3,300 municipalities nationwide to fund promotional efforts. Most of the towns had no idea what to do with the cash, so many blew it on building unnecessary public facilities. Takeshita’s Hometown Creation project is now considered a landmark LDP policy failure. According to the Finance Ministry, the other ministries have requested a total of ¥3.8 trillion for a special budget fund for fiscal 2015. A large chunk of that would go toward public work projects, one of the tools most favored by LDP politicians eager to grease palms in their electoral districts. Abe, who seems to be well-aware of the criticism, has repeatedly stressed that his administration will not engage in pork-barrel spending. “By eliminating the sectionalism in ministries and the practice of doling out funds, I’d like you to work on policies of a different dimension,” Abe told his ministers and economic revitalization experts during his reshuffled Cabinet’s inaugural meeting on Sept. 19. But former Tottori Gov. Yoshihiro Katayama, a Keio University professor who is an expert on local governments, argued that Abe’s plan is still grounded in the LDP’s postwar paradigm of centrally controlling and dishing out money for local projects. Abe instead should first decentralize decision-making and financial resources so rural municipalities can use funds at their own discretion, Katayama said. “The central government should stop assigning money (to municipalities), while (local governments) shouldn’t have to beg for money from the state. Such methods have totally failed in the past,” Katayama said. “But it seems (Abe) hasn’t understood that at all. I believe (his new policy) will end being a failure, too.” One thing, if any, that differentiates Abe’s policy from the past LDP strategies is its focus on the depopulation problem. The government plans to develop a vision for keeping Japan’s population above 100 million for the next 50 years. According to an estimate released in May by the Japan Policy Council, an influential Tokyo-based think tank, nearly half of the nation’s municipalities could face extinction by 2040 from rapid aging and an exodus to urban areas, notably Tokyo and Osaka. The ratio of job offers to job-seekers in Tokyo stood at 1.62 in July, but it was much lower outside the capital, with figures of 0.87 in Hokkaido and 0.74 in Kagoshima, for example, meaning that workers in rural areas have fewer job opportunities than those in Tokyo. This gap is the main driver behind the migration of the younger generations to big cities, officials said. Yet couples in urban areas tend to have lower birth rates, which is consequently driving down the nation’s overall birth rate, they added. For example, Tokyo’s total fertility rate, a key indicator of birth trends in a given year, stood at 1.06 in 2011, versus the national average of 1.39. TFR is the number of children a woman would have if she were to bear children throughout her life in line with age-specific birth rates of a given year. A state-sponsored bill in the Diet would oblige the central and local governments to draw up programs and specific targets for “correcting excessive population concentration” in the Tokyo metropolitan area by creating social infrastructure and job opportunities in rural districts. But Komine of Hosei University argued that depopulation and rural revitalization should be treated separately. People are migrating for the potential economic benefits, and the government should not try to stop them, he said. “If you want to stem the decline of the birth rate, you should take countermeasures in Tokyo, where the birth rate is low,” instead of promoting rural economies, Komine said. For example, the Abe government should build more day care centers to help working women in Tokyo, he said, because Tokyo has more young women than provincial areas and thus would be more effective in pushing up the overall birth rate.",

    "source": "Kansai's fears of new law no state secret <eos> With less than two months to go until the new designated state secrets law comes into force, how, exactly, it will work in practice is the subject of extensive debate and concern. Much of the commentary focuses on how the fundamental rights of individuals will be affected. But municipal and prefectural governments, especially in Kansai, are also concerned about what the new law might mean for local autonomy and access to central government information, and whether that will have repercussions for their residents. Nationwide, nearly 200 local cities and towns have passed statements condemning the new law. As of September, at least a half dozen assemblies in Kyoto, Nara and Osaka prefectures had voiced their opposition. One of the largest bodies in Kansai to oppose the new law was Ikoma, in Nara. Ikoma is the main city in the electoral district of Internal Affairs and Communications Minister Sanae Takaichi, a close ally of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “What, precisely, is to be designated as secret is not clear, leading to a situation of ‘what will become secret is secret.’ Because of this, even in cases of arrests and prosecutions that are connected to law, it won’t be clear as to why the accused is being arrested or prosecuted because the lawyers won’t be able to reveal the evidence in court,” the city assembly said in June. Muko, a small city in Kyoto, expressed similar concerns but added that the vague law could also be used to punish public servants who unknowingly release “secret” information, and that not only the mass media but also scholars, researchers, elected representatives, legal professionals and ordinary citizens would be unable to freely collect information under such constraints. Taro Yamada, a House of Councilors member from Your Party, said that while police departments may be able to get information classified, prefectural governors and assemblies will not have the same privilege. This has created two concerns in Kansai. The first has to do with information sharing between the local and central governments. “Kyoto and Osaka in particular host international summits and the like, which require coordination between local authorities and the Prime Minister’s Office, the Foreign Ministry, the National Police Agency, and other central government organs. Communication between Kansai and national officials can be difficult because too often local authorities are given only the minimum of information by central government officials,” said one Kyoto municipal official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Under the new law, the central government now has an excuse and can say, ‘Sorry, that’s a state secret’ if local officials get angry about being left out of the loop,” the official said. The second cause of concern in Kansai has to do with nuclear power. Fukui Prefecture’s 13 commercial reactors, including 11 operated by Kansai Electric Power Co., provide electricity to the region. But Kyoto and Osaka are also home to groups of anti-nuclear protesters who are well-organized and tenacious compared with other parts of the country. At anti-nuclear rallies in both cities, police keep close tabs on those participating. Under the secrets law, such demonstrations might be considered a threat to national security. Anti-nuclear groups in Kansai and nationwide fear that official harassment will grow against anyone who speaks out against atomic power, and that the officials and their minions will then hide behind the law if and when they are sued in the Osaka or Kyoto district courts. Additionally, though not the issue it is elsewhere, some Kansai leaders have expressed concern about what the new law means for keeping tabs on Self-Defense Forces or U.S. military activity in the region. As both countries deepen cooperation under the new collective self-defense stance adopted by the Cabinet in July, there is local concern that obtaining information on U.S. military operations, one of the main areas targeted by the state secrets law, will become more difficult. “At a military base in Kyotango, Kyoto Prefecture, the United States has installed X-band radar for tracking ballistic missiles. But what the effect of radio waves from the radar might be is unknown. Even if we ask, the government won’t provide the information under the new law,” said Ryoichi Hattori, an Osaka-based activist who opposes the secrets law. The town of Sennan, Osaka Prefecture, near Kansai airport, has already expressed opposition to any attempt by the U.S. military to use it. Any plans by Tokyo or Washington to operate more radar installations in Kansai is sure to be met by local opposition not only from traditional anti-base activists, but also from residents whose attitude is “not in my backyard.” But if information on plans for joint training exercises turns out to be designated a state secret, Tokyo and Washington may find that even those national politicians and political parties who back the security alliance in public may constantly urge caution when it comes to specific operational plans that run the risk of further inflaming residents, and local assemblies, in Kansai or anywhere else. Especially if they are already angry because the plans can’t be made public. At present, most Kansai politicians in the Liberal Democratic Party-Komeito ruling coalition and their corporate backers support the state secrets law. At the same time, the region’s traditional attitude of independence from Tokyo, combined with fierce local pride, mean that towns, cities and leaders, regardless of party ties, are less likely to simply accept excuses about national security if the information local residents want is not made available.",

    "source": "More distrust, less harmony if law pits local patriarchs against Tokyo secrecy fetishists <eos> KYOTO - The state secrets law allows for the designation of 55 items related to national security. But as the new law prepares to go into effect, it’s not clear if municipal and prefectural authorities are on the same page as the central government about the need for it or what will happen if classification creates political problems at the local level. Nineteen of the 55 items deal with defense and target for classification such things as operational plans and research, both for the Self-Defense Forces and the U.S. military in Japan, as well as related intelligence received from foreign governments and international organizations. There are 17 diplomacy-related areas in which information could be classified. These include negotiations on plans and cooperation agreements between Japan and foreign governments and organizations. Another 10 items cover something called “specially designated harmful activities.” They include research and plans related to measures to stop activities so designated from spreading, initiatives to stop cybercrime, and efforts to prevent of nuclear, chemical or biological agents from entering the country. The last nine items include information about halting the spread of terrorism. If many of the items on the list have a less immediately visible impact on local politics, with the exception of areas like Okinawa, where there is an overbearing U.S. military presence, the justification for the last 19 in particular holds the potential for turmoil. Beyond the obvious questions of what is meant by “harmful activities” or “terrorism” lies a more fundamental issue: At what point is a “state” secret no longer merely national in nature but one that infringes upon “local” autonomy? Tokyo bureaucrats with a fetish for secrecy and a taste for power are apt to see “terrorists” everywhere they look, and to view any unauthorized activity — that is, activity not conducted by themselves — as “harmful.” But local police, assemblies and town heads don’t always share such views, and this is where concerns of effective cooperation between state and local authorities arise. Skeptical local governments may not wish to provide such information to Tokyo, especially about local residents, out of a belief that it falls outside the realm of the state secrets law. Likewise, they may request information about defense, diplomacy, or anti-terrorism measures in their prefecture or municipality that they deem necessary to enact local policies, only to be told it is classified and off-limits. In either case, there is a danger the result will be less cooperation and heightened distrust between local and central government politicians and bureaucrats, which in turn could lead to communication breakdowns. The stated official purpose of the secrets law is the protection of Japan against foreign and domestic threats by withholding information that could jeopardize efforts to realize this goal. But the massive national opposition toward the passage of the law may be a sign, with local elections looming next spring, of the more local political, legal and bureaucratic skirmishes to come once the law goes into force in December.",

Monday’s announcement follows an offer of voluntary buyouts to 600 veteran employees in August, part of an overall cost-cutting effort at the Atlanta-based broadcasting company founded by Ted Turner. Turner said Monday that the restructuring includes cutting jobs, eliminating unfilled positions and voluntary departures. The eliminations will affect 18 different locations and will come from its news, entertainment, sports and business units as well as corporate positions. A spokesman said Turner is eliminating 975 jobs in Atlanta, where it is based. That will reduce its workforce in that city to about 5,500. The company also plans to add about 150 new positions in areas of investment and growth. Turner’s CNN division has struggled in recent years to find a programming strategy that will allow it to get and keep viewers as it competes with cable news rivals Fox News and MSNBC. And TNT and TBS, which once relied heavily on reruns of old broadcast shows to fill their schedules, are under increased pressure to create more original programming. Turner Broadcasting System, which also owns The Cartoon Network, HLN, TruTV and Turner Classic Movies, is a unit of New York-based Time Warner Inc., the company behind HBO and Warner Bros. studios.

    "source": "Figuring out the science behind research whaling <eos> Japan has a unique concept of science that doesn’t seem to be accepted in the Western world. Both the esteemed academic journal Nature and the International Court of Justice have essentially handed down rulings over the past year that question the standards of research in Japan. As far as the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seems to be concerned, science requires that you kill the subject of your study and then sell the meat for consumption — especially when talking about whales. This doesn’t bode well for any plans to measure the general fitness of the country’s youth and, perhaps more worringly, one hopes the Institute of Cetacean Research doesn’t start studying the country’s aging population. It’s also worth noting that scientific truth seems to depend on how bad you want it to be true. The last two scientific papers that allegedly reported the discovery of an easy way to make stem cells were retracted by Nature, the academic journal that published them. The papers were found to be full of errors. The research had been done at the government-backed Riken. The lead scientist, Haruko Obokata, became a major celebrity, until problems with the research started coming to light. Obokata says she will prove the methodology is real even though independent scientists have not been able to reproduce the work described in her articles. The inability of scientists to replicate the results calls into question the veracity of any of the claims she has made. The incident has also raised questions over the rigor of scientific research in general in Japan. Similarly, the International Court of Justice ruled in March that the country’s whaling expeditions in the Antarctic lacked scientific vigor and was not scientific research. In other words, to study the whale population and its health by killing whales and then selling the meat isn’t scientific research. The court ruled it was akin to commercial whaling disguised as whale research. At first Japan seemed to accept the decision as it didn’t inflict too much damage on its overall catch figures. Indeed, the Antarctic whale catch represents only 20 percent of the country’s total annual whale take. But then, as always, Abe couldn’t resist a chance to harpoon himself in the foot. Last month, he told a parliamentary committee he wanted to resume commercial whaling “so we may obtain scientific information indispensable to the management of whale resources” — which you have to admit is new tactic. It’s like saying, “Up until now our research whaling was actually commercial whaling but we can do commercial whaling and make it more scientific.” The Japan Whaling Association recognizes that nonlethal research can provide some data but claims whales have to be killed in order to really understand what’s happening with them. “A large range of information is needed for the management and conservation of whales, such as population, age structure, growth rates, age of maturity, reproductive rates, feeding, nutrition and levels of contaminants,” it says on its website. “This type of important information cannot be obtained through small DNA samples or analysis of organochlorine, but only through lethal research.” Lethal Research. It sounds like a movie that will be opening this Halloween. The same institute also concluded that whales eat up to 500 tons of fish a year — that’s five times the amount we humans eat. The ultimate conclusion is simple: The whales are eating all of our fish. If we don’t kill whales, we will have no blue fin tuna, no sushi and we will all starve to death. I’m sure the whales are probably responsible for the eel shortage as well. And damn those whales that sneak into freshwater rivers and devour our unagi! The main problem with whale research — funded mostly with taxpayer dollars — is that the data is dubious. There are no third parties overseeing the experiments, nor has much of it been subject to peer review or been published in scientific journals. I have a feeling that if it were published, it would end up being retracted only a few months later. Japanese officials have suggested making the whale hunts “more scientific” to satisfy the International Court of Justice. Isn’t that pretty much the equivalent of putting a giant altimeter in the cars at Disney’s “Tower of Terror” ride and renaming it “Tower of Altitude and Terror Study”? Every year the amount of whale consumption in the country declines, while the stockpile of whale meat now is close to 5,000 tons. Considering the declining demand and abundance of supply, why does Japan still spend millions of dollars sustaining this industry? The whale research that would be of most interest to me is an investigative piece into which politicians are getting donations from the whaling industry, the relationship between retiring Ministry of Fisheries bureaucrats and the industry, and a full account of who gets government subsidies for research. While we’re at it, perhaps the government could ask its citizens if they wish to pay taxes to sustain the whale industry? (We live in a democracy, allegedly). The Institute of Cetacean Research, supported by Japan, has written several papers on the “health benefits” of balenine (midazole dipeptides) found abundantly in whale meat that are supposed to cure fatigue. That’s part of Japan’s scientific research and a mascot has even been created to represent this incredible substance. If it’s valid research, perhaps they should submit it to Nature magazine? I’m sure it would stand up to peer review. As an omnivore, I can’t say I’m opposed to eating whales. Endangered animals should obviously not be eaten, but I am opposed to breaking international law in the name of science. And just maybe, given enough time, the government will once again redeem its stature in the science world by finding an easy way to make stem cells. Perhaps even from whales? But only after they have been killed and eaten. You just have to believe.",

The Austrians returned the fire and an engagement of some importance ensued. The point mentioned as that at which the first gun of the war between Austria and Servia was fired may become historic as the scene of the opening of the greatest war known in history. Temeskub is not given on the available maps, but is probably a small place on the Danube south of Temesvar, a town of considerable importance in Hungary about 80 miles north of the river which is the boundary between Servia and Hungary. War now having been declared by Austria against Servia, the Japanese Army authorities will dispatch military attaches to the scene of the hostilities if the war seems going to be of long duration. The attaches to be dispatched will be appointed at the Japanese Embassies at Vienna and St. Petersburg. 75 YEARS AGO Monday, July 17, 1939 Tokyo unveils first private air raid shelter With the annual summer air defense drills just around the corner, and in tune with the embattled times, an air raid shelter for a private home has made its appearance in Tokyo. The underground bomb-proof chamber, completed recently in the garden of Hiroshi Matsudaira, a businessman of Shibuya, is probably the first and, as yet, the only one of its kind in Japan. The idea was suddenly born in the mind of the owner while work was underway on an 11-foot terrace along one side of his garden this spring and consists of three Hume pipes eight feet in length and six feet in diameter placed end to end, convertible into three separate chambers. Buried underground, they are enclosed by walls of concrete four inches thick. Entering the cavernous structure guarded by an airtight door, one comes upon racks for gas masks and garments for protection against poison gas. A poison-proof water compartment is also found here while ranged along the walls are seats capable of accommodating 20 at a pinch. Underneath the seats are store spaces for food as well as compartments for shovels, picks and other paraphernalia and even a space for a radio. A ventilator at one end of the cave assures plentiful supply of air and switches for electric light have also been installed. The seats are capable of being utilized as a ping-pong table so that it also serves as a nice cooling-off place in summer when the rest of the world above is steaming. The cost is said to have been around ¥4,000 — no small sum. But, being 8 feet below the surface, it is practically safe from any wandering bomb that might drop earthward, proving an adequate recompense for the outlay required. 50 YEARS AGO Monday, July 20, 1964 Torrential rain kills 106 in Sanin, Hokuriku One hundred and six persons were reported dead, 34 missing and 137 others injured as houses collapsed and landslides occurred following torrential rains which swept the Sanin and Hokuriku areas from Saturday through Sunday morning. About 583 houses were destroyed, washed away or damaged, and more than 40,000 others flooded. Hardest hit was Shimane Prefecture where 87 persons were reported dead, 27 missing and 105 others injured. The rainfall reached 54 cm in Matsue, a new record since the local observatory was established in 1941. Dikes were broken for a space of about 20 meters on the Akagawa River in Kamo-machi, Ohara-gun, Shimane Prefecture at about 3 a.m. Sunday and roaring waters flooded 1,200 out of 1,500 houses of the town almost up to their roofs. Two persons were killed when their house collapsed and pinned them under its debris at Otamachi, Ota, Sunday morning. Eight others were feared dead when a similar accident happened at Shizuma-machi in the same city. 25 YEARS AGO Monday, July 24, 1989 LDP loses Upper House to socialists in election The Liberal-Democratic Party was certain to lose its majority in the House of Councilors for the first time since the party’s founding in 1955 as the Japan Socialist Party coasted to a landslide victory in Sunday’s national election. The JSP, the largest opposition party, is expected to have won more seats than the LDP in the voting when the final outcome is made known this evening. There are 126 seats up for grabs, one-half of the 252-member Upper House. By 1:30 a.m. today, 105 candidates had been declared successful. They included 40 members of the JSP, which previously held 22 of the seats being contested, and 32 members of the LDP, which went into the contest with 66 seats. The LDP would have had to clinch at least 54 seats to retain a simple majority of 127 in the Upper House, but it was expected to emerge with only about 35 seats. Ryutaro Hashimoto, the LDP’s secretary general, and Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, who is president of the LDP, as well as all other leaders of the conservative party, had expected a major setback stemming from widespread voter criticism of the consumption tax, the Recruit influence-buying scandal and the opening of the country’s agriculture markets to foreign products. Owing to the LDP’s fall in popularity, candidates backed by the JSP or Rengo, the Japanese Private Sector Trade Union Confederation, ousted incumbent LDP candidates in most of the 26 single-seat constituencies, most of which were traditional LDP strongholds. The JSP’s landslide is expected to enhance the party’s position in spearheading anti-LDP movements in the Diet as well as moves toward a coalition government among the opposition parties.",

    "source": "Is 'Kobe Formula' spanner in works? <eos> On March 18, 1975, in a show of defiance against Japan-U.S. military policy, the Kobe Municipal Assembly passed a resolution that became known as the “Kobe Formula.” From that day forward, the resolution said, any ship carrying nuclear weapons would not be allowed to enter Kobe harbor, and would have to officially declare it did not have any nukes on board. French, Indian and Italian naval vessels agreed to cooperate, but the U.S. Navy refused. In the nearly four decades since, there has been little pressure on the part of the United States to change it. Following the Great Kobe Earthquake of January 1995, the U.S. offered to dispatch its navy to Kobe for humanitarian assistance. Partially due to the Kobe resolution, the various offers were mostly declined. In the late 1990s, there was a half-hearted push by some American diplomats in Kansai to overturn the resolution (U.S. Navy officials, by contrast, said that was not something they were seeking). Due to stiff opposition in the Kobe assembly, however, the effort went nowhere. Today, while many Kobe politicians, especially in the Liberal Democratic Party, say the resolution is outdated, none see the advantage of fighting to overturn it. Those who back it, including opposition parties and their supporters, gather each March 18 to commemorate the resolution’s passage and to call for an end to nuclear weapons. What will happen, though, to the resolution under the new rules for collective self-defense? Given the emphasis Hyogo Prefecture in particular is putting on the need to have a comprehensive disaster plan in place for major earthquakes, and given the fact that Tokyo and Washington are moving forward with plans to increase U.S. participation in disaster relief efforts based on the lessons both sides learned from “Operation Tomodachi” after the March 11, 2011, mega-quake and tsunami, it seems fair to conclude that ports near Kobe, such as Osaka and Himeji, might see more military activity in the name of joint training for natural disasters. Under Article VI of the 1960 U.S.-Japan security treaty, the United States is granted use by its land, air and naval forces of facilities and areas in Japan. A natural disaster or military emergency in which Kobe harbor is ordered by the Japanese government to serve as a major base for relief operations might lead to a U.S.-Japan naval presence in the port. Short of that, however, it appears Tokyo and Washington are, for the moment, content to sail past Kobe and its rough political waters as they navigate a new relationship based on Japan’s reinterpretation of collective self-defense.",

The rising mercury prompted the Meteorological Agency to issue heat wave advisories for 41 of the 47 prefectures. The preliminary figure of people being rushed to hospitals came to 1,389, of whom 10 died and 20 were in a serious condition, according to the tally. Of 927 observation points of the agency nationwide, 702 — more than 70 percent — logged highs of at least 30 degrees Celsius, while about a quarter of all locations topped 35 degrees. The city of Higashiomi in Shiga Prefecture clocked a record-breaking 38.8 degrees, and the mercury reached new all-time highs at 13 other locations, including Obama in Fukui Prefecture, at 38.6 degrees. According to the agency, a high-pressure system in the Pacific Ocean sent a blanket of warm air over a wide swath of the archipelago, from the Tohoku region in the northeast down to Okinawa at the southern tip. A cold front heading south is forecast to bring the possibility of cooling rain over the country on Sunday, but the stifling heat will likely return on Monday and is expected to continue, the agency said.

    "source": "Self-defense less collective at local level <eos> After the Shiga gubernatorial election earlier this month, in which Taizo Mikazuki, the hand-picked successor to former Gov. Yukiko Kada, defeated the ruling coalition’s candidate, certain media agencies and pundits suggested that collective self-defense had no impact on the race. Such arguments were factually correct. Exit polls showed that pocketbook issues, name recognition and even questions about nuclear power weighed more heavily on voters’ minds than collective self-defense, per se. But what the analysts overlooked was how Abe’s handling of the sensitive debate and his push for a Cabinet decision impacted the election. Voters objected to Abe’s strong-arm tactics, as did his Liberal Democratic Party’s coalition partner, pacifist New Komeito. Shiga’s LDP officials admitted that New Komeito was not as helpful as it could have been in stumping for their preferred candidate. Even Abe told reporters after the election that he did not intend to deny the influence that collective defense had on the final result. Yet the Shiga election is also important because it may foreshadow the kinds of practical issues and local attitudes central government officials and local leaders in Kansai and elsewhere will face as a result of the Cabinet’s decision to reinterpret the war-renouncing Constitution. In Kansai, official discussion of what the repercussions will be at the local level hasn’t really begun. Partially, this is because nobody is quite sure what will happen. But it’s also the case that, compared with Kanto, Okinawa and even parts of Hokkaido, the presence of the military in Kansai is not as visible. Thus, dealing with base-related issues that may arise from the Cabinet decision is not really on the region’s political radar. The Self-Defense Forces’ main Kansai-area bases are in and around Itami and Yao airports in Osaka Prefecture, at the ports of Kobe and Maizuru, Kyoto Prefecture, and in smaller administrative support facilities and supply depots in Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Wakayama and Nara prefectures. But at least two Kansai communities are thinking about what the Cabinet’s reinterpretation might mean. Last October, the Aibano Training Area in Takashima, Shiga Prefecture, became the first place in Honshu to host MV-22 Ospreys when the Ground Self-Defense Force and the U.S. Marines held a joint exercise. Under the new collective self-defense guidelines, those living beside the base want to know if such training missions at Aibano will grow, especially given past and present concerns and questions about the Osprey’s safety. In addition, the Air Self-Defense Force’s auxiliary base at Kyogamisaki, in Kyotango, Kyoto Prefecture, will host a U.S. X-band radar facility. The prefectural government says up to 160 U.S. service members and technicians will be assigned to the facility, which will serve as a front-line defense against North Korean missiles. In the corporate community, there is general support for Abe’s decision. Kansai business groups, whose top members include representatives from defense contractors, extended support but urged Abe to convince the world that Japan was not going to invade or go to war with another country. “We agree with the thinking behind the Cabinet decision to reinterpret collective self-defense. But under what conditions it will be carried out, including the geographical limitations, needs to be clarified,” said Kazutoshi Murao, an executive director of the Kansai Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai). What the local impact might be from increased deployments of either SDF or U.S. military units to larger facilities such as Maizuru, which might serve as a critical naval base if a crisis erupts on the Korean Peninsula, has long been on the minds of politicians in northern Kyoto, though they always insist it’s an issue they have little control over. On the other hand, Toru Hashimoto, while Osaka governor, suggested that Kansai airport might host the U.S. Marines currently deployed at the Futenma air station in Okinawa, an idea he pitched and then quickly dropped. But if Kansai officials are only making vague noises about what they can do for collective self-defense, a few are more clear about bolstering cooperation with the U.S. military in another area: local disaster response drills. On Aug. 31, the U.S. military will join a disaster response drill conducted by seven cities and one town in Hyogo. The details remain sketchy, with Hyogo officials saying last week they were waiting to find out who, exactly, from the U.S. side will be coming and what they’ll be doing. “This training exercise will involve the U.S. military, the Self-Defense Forces, the coast guard, local police and fire departments, and local bureaucrats. It aims to have the U.S. military and the SDF work together, and the U.S. role will be to participate in drills involving the use of helicopters,” Hyogo Gov. Tetsuzo Ido told reporters last month. “However, what the exact role of the U.S. will be is still under discussion.” He added that Ospreys would not take part, but that the aircraft might be used in a separate drill involving the seven-prefecture, four-city Union of Kansai Governments. Over the coming months, as the Diet discusses further legislation related to the collective defense reinterpretation, questions about what the local impact might be are likely to arise. With nationwide local elections scheduled for next spring, there will be pressure on Abe by local LDP chapters to be more attuned to local voter attitudes not only toward self-defense, but also toward a range of issues on which the prime minister and his Cabinet are increasingly perceived as being too Tokyo-centric. At the same time, more Kansai leaders are starting to view recent events as a chance to push for, or at least discuss, greater SDF and U.S. military involvement in local disaster preparation drills and response planning. From their point of view, such moves constitute a local version of “reinterpreting collective self-defense,” one that is much more immediately visible than the one approved by Abe’s Cabinet.",

    "source": "Mitsubishi Estate to tap Otemachi for new hot spring facility <eos> Tourists and local residents in the Otemachi business district will soon be able to enjoy a natural hot spring bath in the heart of Tokyo, after real-estate giant Mitsubishi Estate Co. confirmed Tuesday it had successfully tapped a hot spring source and would proceed with plans to build a bathing facility. Mitsubishi Estate hopes the authentic hot spring baths will provide visitors with insight into Japanese culture, and lure a multitude of foreign visitors to the area during the 2020 Olympic Games. The “Otemachi Onsen” is the first natural hot spring dug up in the area. The source was discovered at a 11.2-sq.-kilometer site originally designated for the construction of a hotel and office complex. The area has recently undergone a wave of development aimed at cementing its status as a business center and strengthening industry support services. Work on the site began this year and is scheduled for completion in the spring of 2016. The baths will be offered at a facility fed by water pumped up from 1,500 meters below the ground at a rate of 240 liters per minute. The company said it plans to route the hot spring water to other sports and housing facilities within the district at a later date, and will disclose which facilities are fed by the hot spring source to volunteers and disaster relief teams in the event of emergency situations. Mitsubishi Estate said the water will be pumped at a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius and contains high levels of sodium chloride. The company claims it can provide visitors with relief from muscle and joint pains, as well as provide other therapeutic benefits such as alleviating digestive disorders and helping to regulate the autonomic nervous system.",

The reductions, expected to be announced as soon as this week, could be in the Nokia unit and the parts of Microsoft that overlap with that business, as well as in marketing and engineering, Bloomberg reported. Since absorbing the handset business of Nokia this spring, Microsoft has 127,000 employees, far more than rivals Apple Inc and Google Inc. Wall Street is expecting Chief Executive Satya Nadella to make some cuts, which would represent Microsoft’s first major layoffs since 2009. The restructuring may end up being the biggest in Microsoft history, topping the 5,800 jobs cut in 2009, the report said. Some of the job cuts will be in marketing departments for businesses such as the global Xbox team, and among software testers, while other job cuts may result from changes Nadella is making to the engineering organization, Bloomberg reported. Last week, Nadella circulated a memo to employees promising to “flatten the organization and develop leaner business processes” but deferred any comment on widely expected job cuts at the software company. Nadella said he would address detailed organizational and financial issues for the company’s new financial year, which started at the beginning of this month, when Microsoft reports quarterly results on July 22. Microsoft could not be immediately reached for comment outside regular business hours.",

    "source": "If chimps inherit their intelligence, does that prove humans do, too? <eos> Some people are smarter than others. And though animal intelligence is far less well studied, it turns out that within a particular population, say of chimpanzees, some animals are smarter than others, too — and these differences are heritable. To put it another way, some chimps’ mothers are smarter than other chimps’ mothers. There are few thornier subjects than human intelligence, and specifically, the idea that it has a genetic basis. If we have been concerned by facing up to the evidence in humans, will we accept it any more easily in our chimp cousins? That’s the question posed by biologists who have studied the heritability of intelligence in chimps. It’s an interesting question. While we are relatively happy to accept that traits such as height and eye color come from our parents, it makes us uncomfortable to conclude that the same is true of intelligence. The role of genetics in animal intelligence has been even less fully investigated. We are right to be uncomfortable about humans. Intelligence is a much more complicated trait than height, so it will be harder to find evidence that it has a heritable component. Even setting that aside, the idea that we are stuck with the cards we’ve been dealt at birth is a hard one to swallow. We like to think that we are all equal and we get where we are through hard work. There’s another issue: The most commonly used test for intelligence, IQ, is itself rife with problems. And there are still worse taboos. If we were to allow that intelligence was genetic, the very real fear is that some people would start arguing that (say) men are smarter than women, or that some races are intellectually superior to others. It is by no means an idle worry. The former president of Harvard University had to resign in 2006 after saying that there weren’t enough high-IQ women around. And a book in the 1990s, “The Bell Curve,” generated huge controversy with its linkage of racial groups and intelligence. Going back further, the examples become worse. In the late 19th century, Charles Darwin’s cousin Francis Galton founded the Eugenics Education Society. Believing that intelligence was strongly genetically determined, he suggested that genetically “superior” people should be allowed to have children, while “inferior” people should be sterilized. The idea did huge damage, catching on in the United States, where thousands of people were sterilized, and in Germany, where it was embraced by the Nazis. So you can see why evidence that there is indeed a genetic component to intelligence has been viewed with suspicion. Many studies, and in particular comparisons of identical and nonidentical twins raised together and raised apart, have found that there is a strongly heritable component to intelligence. IQ turns out to be about 50 percent heritable. This means that half of the differences in intelligence between different people can be put down to genetic factors. For height, the proportion is 90 percent. This view seems to have percolated down into general knowledge. Most people would take the common-sense view that if you have clever parents, you’re already on the road to being clever yourself, but also that the opportunities you get during your childhood and youth will go a long way to influencing how smart you become. It turns out that a similar proportion of chimp intelligence is now known to be heritable. The last time I spoke with Tetsuro Matsuzawa — the renowned head of the Primate Research Institute at Kyoto University — he emphasized how smart chimps are. “We underestimate chimpanzee intelligence,” he said. Now a new paper demonstrates what Matsuzawa knows to be true from his close work with wild and captive chimps: Some are smarter than others. William Hopkins, of Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, and colleagues studied 99 captive chimps (from age 9 to 54) and had them perform 13 different tasks. Because the chimps’ backgrounds are known, the researchers are able to account for genetics and the environment in which each animal was raised, and so are able to separate out the proportion of ability that is down to genetics. They found that about 50 percent of the variation in chimp ability is down to their genes. (The results are in the journal Current Biology, DOI reference 10.1016/j.cub.2014.05.076.) “As is the case in humans, genes matter when it comes to cognitive abilities in chimpanzees,” says Hopkins. “It doesn’t mean that they are the only factor determining cognitive abilities, but they cannot be ignored.” Another interesting spinoff of this research is that it could illuminate our understanding of human intelligence. In chimps we don’t have to worry about what socioeconomic background they came from, or which school they attended. Eventually, the Yerkes team says, the work may uncover particular genes that are related to intelligence. This is an intensely debated subject. So far, no genes have been definitively linked to intelligence. (There have, on the other hand, been genes linked to adult weight and, of course, to many different genetic diseases.) Even the thought of it is enough to make people invoke “Brave New World” and “Gattaca” — fictional explorations of societies where people are stratified according to their genes. I spoke to Matsuzawa again this week, and he is not surprised by the Yerkes results. “Genetic and environmental factors both must be important,” he says. “The question is, how?” Matsuzawa says his team have sequenced the genome of one of their “prodigy” chimps, Ayumu, and that of Ayumu’s super-smart mother, Ai, and his father, Akira. “You can see what is inherited from the father and what is from the mother,” says Matsuzawa. “That’s exciting.” Hopkins says, “What specific genes underlie the observed individual differences in cognition is not clear, but pursuing this question may lead to candidate genes that changed in human evolution and allowed for the emergence of some human-specific specializations in cognition.” He stops short of suggesting that we might actually find genes underlying differences in human intelligence. But candidate genes will no doubt be found. And then we can expect an intense burst of controversy and soul-searching.",

The 30 million visitors it draws each year are a testament to its popularity. Typically, an Asakusa tour starts by entering the Kaminarimon Gate of Sensoji Temple, the district’s definitive symbol and landmark. With its enormous red paper lantern hanging from the middle beam, it is one of the most recognizable sites in Japanese travel photos. Inside is Nakamise, one of the city’s oldest surviving arcades, with a history dating back to the Edo Period (1603-1868). While some shops sell tacky souvenirs targeting tourists, others are more established and have been in place for more than a century. At the end of the long row of shops is the main building of Tokyo’s oldest temple, which, according to legend, was built in 628 to enshrine a statue of the Buddhist goddess of mercy that had been salvaged from the nearby Sumida River. The area flourished through the Meiji and Showa eras and played an important role in spreading popular forms of entertainment, including kabuki and “yose rakugo” houses, but gradually lost its sheen as a cultural center after 1964, the year Tokyo hosted Japan’s first Olympics. Alarmed by its declining popularity, residents have made various attempts to revitalize Asakusa, including holding an annual Samba Carnival and lighting up Kaminarimon and Sensoji. Thanks to these efforts, as well as the 2012 opening of nearby Tokyo Skytree, the world’s tallest broadcasting tower, Asakusa’s popularity is now back on an upward trajectory. The area is undergoing redevelopment targeted at the increase in international tourism expected ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.",

The mistake came to light after someone in Nara Prefecture was hospitalized after coming down with symptoms of food poisoning, apparently after consuming calabash or bottle gourd grown from the seedlings earlier this month. Company representatives apologized Sunday for “causing so much trouble and inconvenience,” and warned customers not to eat the calabash gourds. Some varieties of calabash are edible, but the three types of seedlings sold by Royal Home Center were not. Customers who purchased any of the three types — clustering gourds, large-sized gourds and “tsurukubi,” or long-necked gourds — can get a refund. The young plants, labeled as “fun to grow and delicious to eat,” were sold at 30 stores in 11 prefectures: Chiba, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Saitama, Aichi, Kyoto, Nara, Osaka, Hyogo, Okayama and Hiroshima, between April and June in both 2013 and 2014. The company said 3,072 seedlings were sold. Royal Home Center said the gourds were sold with the same labels the producer — Green Plaza Yamacho — had put on the packages when shipping the seedlings. The company decided to recall the remaining products after receiving a complaint from a consumer who had purchased mislabeled seedlings from a local distributor and grew the gourds. According to the complaint reported July 7, the purchaser’s friend — a woman in her 40s from Nara Prefecture — developed symptoms including diarrhea and vomiting after consuming the fruit. Royal Home Center said the company will take steps to improve procedures for verifying labels and was considering further measures to prevent any reoccurrences. For more information about refunds, call Royal Home Center’s customer center at 0120-256-186.

    "source": "China food scandal drags in other chains, spreads to McDonald's Japan <eos> SHANGHAI - A toxic food scandal in China is spreading fast, dragging in U.S. coffee chain Starbucks, Burger King Worldwide Inc. and others, as well as products of McDonald’s Corp. as far away as Japan. McDonald’s and KFC’s parent Yum Brands Inc. apologized to Chinese customers Monday after it emerged that Shanghai Husi Food Co. Ltd., a unit of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC, had supplied expired meat to the two chains. In Tokyo, McDonald’s Holdings Japan said Tuesday it gets 20 percent of the chicken it uses for Chicken McNuggets from Shanghai Husi but stopped selling nuggets made with meat purchased from the Chinese firm on Monday. McDonald’s Japan apologized to its customers and said it has switched to another chicken meat supplier. The firm said it has stopped importing chicken meat from Shanghai Husi and said if the reports are true, it is “completely unacceptable.” A spokesman said McDonald’s Japan has been using meat supplied by Shanghai Husi since 2002, but no major problems have occurred so far regarding complaints from customers. On Tuesday, Starbucks in China said some of its stores previously sold products containing chicken originally sourced from Shanghai Husi, a firm that was shut down Sunday by local regulators after a TV report showed staff using expired meat and picking up meat from the floor to add to the mix. Heidi Barker, a U.S. spokeswoman for McDonald’s, said in an email that McNuggets were the only product affected in Japan. Yoshinoya-parent Hop Hing Group Holdings Ltd., convenience store FamilyMart Co. Ltd. and Chinese chain Wallace urged diners not to worry and said they did not currently use any products from Shanghai Husi. Fast-food chain Burger King and Dicos, China’s third-ranked diner owned by Ting Hsin International, said they would remove Shanghai Husi food products from their outlets. Pizza chain Papa John’s International Inc. said on its Weibo blog that it had taken down all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi and cut ties with the supplier. Food safety is one of the top issues for Chinese consumers after a scandal in 2008 where dairy products tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of six infants and made many thousands sick. Other food scandals have hit the meat and dairy industries in recent years, and many Chinese look to foreign brands as offering higher safety standards. Starbucks said on its Chinese microblog site that it had no direct business relationship with Shanghai Husi, but that some of its chicken acquired from another supplier had originally come from Husi for its Chicken Apple Sauce Panini products. This had been sold in 13 different provinces and major cities. Starbucks added that all the products had already been removed from the shelves. The scare has stirred local consumers and become one of the most discussed topics online by the country’s influential “netizens,” with some users writing and spreading long lists of firms thought to be tarnished. The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. came under the spotlight this year after a supplier’s donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat. It also came under fire for selling expired duck meat in 2011. Burger King said in a Weibo statement posted late Monday that it had taken off its shelves all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi Food and had launched an investigation. Dicos said it pulled all ham products supplied by Shanghai Husi, and would stop serving its ham sandwich product for breakfast. “We will continue to carry out a probe into Shanghai Husi Food and its related firms, to understand whether or not it followed national regulations,” Dicos said in a statement. IKEA said on Weibo that Shanghai Husi had previously been a supplier, but had not provided the firm with products since September last year. Domino’s Pizza Inc. and Doctor’s Associates Inc.’s Subway brand, which were named in online reports as being supplied meat from Shanghai Husi, said their outlets in China did not use meat products from the firm.",

    "source": "Ruling hinged on assistance law revamp: summary <eos> The following is a rough translation of the text of Supreme Court’s July 18 ruling that found permanent residents ineligible for welfare payments. [FACTS DETERMINED BY THE FUKUOKA HIGH COURT] The old Public Assistance Law (abolished in 1950) stated, in Article 1: “This law is aimed at protecting the lives of people in need equally, without discrimination or preferential treatment, thereby enhancing social welfare.” Article 1 of the current (1950) Public Assistance Law states: “The purpose of this Act is for the State to guarantee a minimum standard of living as well as to promote self-support for all citizens who are living in poverty by providing necessary public assistance according to the level of poverty, based on the principles prescribed in Article 25 of the Constitution of Japan.” Article 2 of the law states: “All citizens (kokumin) may receive public assistance under this Act (hereinafter referred to as “public assistance”) in a nondiscriminatory and equal manner as long as they satisfy the requirements prescribed by this Act.” A 1954 welfare ministry notice to prefectural governments stipulates that, for the time being, foreigners in poverty should be given the same level of assistance as Japanese citizens. The notice further says public assistance applications from foreigners should be processed in the same ways as those from Japanese are, except that when foreigners are given assistance, the (municipal) agencies in charge must report the cases to their prefectural governor and confirm through the governor that the individuals in question are not already eligible to receive such assistance from agencies in the foreigners’ places of origin. In 1990, the welfare ministry released new guidelines, limiting eligibility for foreigners based on its 1954 notice to those with permanent residential status. In 1981, when the Cabinet decided that Japan would join the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees as well as the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (hereinafter referred to as “Refugee Convention”), the issue of whether to revise the nationality clause (limiting legal protection to Japanese nationals) in domestic laws such as the Public Assistance Law, National Pension Law and the Child Rearing Allowance Law, arose, as Article 23 of the convention stipulated that: “The Contracting States shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as is accorded to their nationals.” With the 1981 enactment of legislation mandating revisions (in Japan, to accommodate the convention’s requirements), various laws, such as the National Pension Law and the Child Rearing Allowance Law, were revised to abolish the nationality clause, but no such revisions were made to the Public Assistance Law. In a joint screening committee set up by the legal affairs, foreign affairs and social and labor committees of the Lower House, a government representative in May 1981 said Japan would not be barred from joining the Refugee Convention for not abolishing the nationality clause in the Public Assistance Law, because ever since the public assistance system was created, foreigners had been treated in the same way as nationals. JUDGEMENT OF THE FUKUOKA HIGH COURT] By joining the Refugee Convention, and from related Diet deliberations, the legislative and administrative arms of the government can be construed as having approved that the nation shoulders a degree of legal responsibility to provide public assistance and therefore accord to a certain group of foreigners the same level of public assistance as is accorded to their nationals. Therefore the status of a certain group of foreigners to receive the aforementioned treatment has been legally established. [JUDGMENT OF THE SUPREME COURT] The old Public Assistance Law did not distinguish, in its application, between “nationals” and others, whereas the current law, in articles 1 and 2, stipulates that it is “citizens” who are eligible. The “citizens” referred to by the law can be interpreted to mean Japanese nationals and exclude foreigners. Since the current law’s enactment, no legal revision has been made to expand eligible persons to include a certain group of foreigners, and no other legal legislation exists to enable the application of the provisions for assistance accorded under the law to a certain group of foreigners. Therefore, there is no ground for the Public Assistance Law to be applied to foreigners. The (1954 welfare ministry) notice is one issued by an administrative body. Even if public assistance has been in reality accorded to a certain group of foreigners as an administrative measure, this cannot be interpreted as meaning that the Public Assistance Law now applies to foreigners in the absence of legislative measures, such as revisions to its articles 1 and 2. It is also clear from the wording of the notice that it is premised on the understanding that the Public Assistance Law does not apply to foreigners, and hence foreigners who are living in poverty should be given necessary protection as an administrative measure for the time being. Therefore, it is through an administrative measure (rather than a legislative measure) that foreigners have, to date, effectively been made eligible for public assistance. Neither the Public Assistance Law as it currently stands nor any other law can be construed as conferring on foreigners eligibility for assistance.",

    "source": "A closer look at the Supreme Court's welfare benefits ruling <eos> Opinions are divided over how the Supreme Court ruling last week declaring permanent foreign residents of Japan ineligible for welfare payments will affect the foreign communities in Japan. In Japan, welfare benefits comprise public assistance for financially needy people, including monthly stipends for living expenses and housing, as well as free medical and nursery services. Lawyers and foreign rights advocates see the top court’s ruling as a sign that municipalities will grow more hostile to foreigners, while central and local government officials stress the ruling will by no means change the way they scrutinize foreign applicants. Let’s take a look at the facts and some of potential repercussions from the verdict. What was the ruling about? An 82-year-old ethnic Chinese woman in Oita Prefecture who was born and raised in Japan sued the city of Oita in 2009 as she was denied welfare benefits on the grounds that she had some savings. She filed another application later that was accepted and has been claiming welfare benefits since 2011. Her claims aside, the trial was pivotal in that it forced the courts to finally clarify whether foreigners are entitled to welfare benefits — something the judiciary has never had to consider. Last Friday, the Supreme Court clearly ruled for the first time that they are not because foreigners are not considered Japanese citizens, overturning the Fukuoka High Court’s 2011 decision. How did foreigners first start to receive benefits in Japan? The 1950 Public Assistance Law stipulates that the state should take measures to protect every financially struggling “citizen” of Japan from poverty and ensure a minimal standard living. Four years later, the welfare ministry issued a nationwide notice to municipalities explaining that the law does not cover foreign residents due to its allusion to nationality. But poverty-stricken foreigners, it said, should nonetheless be given any assistance deemed necessary by the municipalities. Since then, municipalities have customarily interpreted this to mean that they can decide whether to dole out the benefits at their own discretion. As a result, foreign residents here have received welfare benefits for years — at the mercy of local governments. In 1990, the ministry narrowed the scope of foreigners subject to benefits to those with permanent residency or long-term visas. What about other social security programs? Japan used to exclude foreigners from almost all social security programs, including child-rearing allowances and the national pension system. Laws for all of these programs stipulated its recipients be “Japanese nationals,” until Japan joined a series of U.N.-designated international treaties, such as the International Covenants on Human Rights in 1979, and the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees in 1982. By joining these accords, Japan became treaty-bound to treat foreigners on an equal footing with its own people and pressured into ditching the nationality clauses previously included in these programs. What happened to the benefits? Unlike many other programs, the original 1950 law for welfare benefits has received no tweaks and continues to discriminate against foreigners by stating that legitimate recipients must be Japanese citizens. Upon signing up for the 1982 refugee treaty, the government at the time insisted there was no need to rid the law of the nationality clause, arguing municipalities were already treating foreign applicants in the same way as Japanese in accordance with its 1954 notice. So how will the ruling affect foreign communities here? When contacted by The Japan Times, the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry said no major policy review is in the works on how to handle claims by foreigners seeking welfare benefits. “We understand the ruling merely endorsed our policy of all these years,” said ministry official Hiroki Morishita. “Foreign residents have never been eligible for the benefits. This will continue to be the case and nothing will change.” Likewise, local governments in Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo, Kawasaki and Minokamo in Gifu — all of which have large foreign communities than elsewhere in Japan — said they are not considering subjecting foreign applicants to stricter scrutiny. But Hisao Seto, lead defense lawyer for the 82-year-old Chinese woman, is not convinced. He says the government might feel tempted to target foreigners if they pressed with the need to trim budgets amid ever-swelling welfare expenditures. Seto said he considers the Supreme Court ruling a virtual “warning” to foreigners in Japan. “What it’s trying to say,” he said, “is that as a foreigner you shouldn’t consider working or living in Japan because if you were ever to get injured or sick, chances are you will be denied the welfare payments you need, depending on the mood of local officials you deal with,” he said. What part of the foreign community will be hit hardest? Topping the list is probably the Koreans who were forcibly brought to Japan before and during World War II after the 1910 annexation of the Korean Peninsula. Some still live without pensions, because by the time Japan removed the nationality clause from its pension system in 1982, they had turned 35 or older, making it impossible to complete the 25 years of pension premiums payments required to before the age of 60, when individuals were then eligible to tap their pension payments. “For those people welfare benefits have been the last social safety net they could count on, without having to depend financially on their kids to survive,” said Hiroshi Tanaka, professor emeritus of sociology at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo. Eriko Suzuki, an associate professor of Kokushikan University in Tokyo who specializes in foreign labor issues, points out that migrant “nikkei” workers from Brazil and so-called Indochina refugees from countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia also need the benefits. Consigned to taking low-paid, dangerous or menial jobs, many of them are often injured and find themselves at great risk of becoming unemployed, she said. “Accepting foreigners as a labor force and then abandoning them once they’ve become useless will clearly look very bad for Japan in the international community,” Suzuki said.",

May Myat Noe — the country’s first winner of an international beauty contest — lashed back at her accusers at a tightly packed news conference. She said representatives of the Miss Asia Pacific World pageant lied about her age — saying she was 18 instead of 16 — and tried to pressure her into getting plastic surgery “from head to toe.” Noe denied having breast implants as claimed by David Kim, director of media for the South Korean-based pageant. He said the surgery was provided free of charge to help boost the teen into superstardom. Kim said Noe was stripped of her title last week because she was dishonest and unappreciative, and that she ran off with her tiara after learning of the decision. Noe said she boarded a plane for Myanmar before getting word. She said she did not intend to steal the crown, but also wasn’t going to give it back without a “sorry,” not just to her, but also to Myanmar. “I’m not even proud of this crown,” she said after opening a blue box and placing the tiara on the table in front of her. “I don’t want a crown from an organization with such a bad reputation.” The pageant says the Swarovski tiara is worth more than $100,000. Noe’s mother, who accompanied her on the trip to South Korea, cried when asked about the experience. The Miss Asia Pacific World pageant, now in its fourth year, is no stranger to controversy. In 2011, Wales representative Amy Willerton and several other contestants alleged that the contest had been fixed after a woman representing Venezuela was apparently named runner-up of the talent round before competing. The argument with organizers — captured on video and uploaded to YouTube under the title “Confessions of a Beauty Queen” — was widely circulated in the pageant community. Some of the contestants also accused officials of asking the women for sex in return for higher placement in the contest, and charged that the police called into investigate the allegations were bribed. Those allegations were denied by Kim. “It is not true that the girls were sleeping with the organizers or the director,” he said. “The police already announced that these were just rumors. We checked everything, the CCTV in the hotel, everything. It was just rumors.” Myanmar, which only recently emerged from a half century of military rule and self-imposed isolation, started sending contestants to international pageants again in 2012. Noe’s win was widely covered in local media.",

The lawsuit, filed by two current and two former workers at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, claims that Tepco and its contractors failed to ensure workers are paid promised hazard allowances, a court filing showed. The workers say Tepco, allowed subcontractors to skim funds allocated for wages to bolster their own profits on the decommissioning project at the expense of workers. The lawsuit seeks the equivalent of roughly ¥62 million in unpaid wages from Tepco and related contractors. It marks the first time that the utility has been sued for the labor practices of the construction companies it employs. The lawsuit also asks that the 6,000 workers partaking in the nuclear clean-up project either be made effectively government employees, be put on the Tepco payroll directly or be fairly paid. Tsuguo Hirota, 68, the lawyer coordinating the lawsuit, said he expects two additional workers will join the action immediately and that more could follow. Japanese law allows for additional plaintiffs with related claims to join an existing lawsuit. “A year ago, Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe told the world that Fukushima was under control,” Hirota said in an interview. “But that’s not the case. Workers are not getting promised hazard pay and skilled workers are leaving. It’s becoming a place for amateurs only, and that has to worry anyone who lives near the plant.” Tepco had no immediate comment. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday morning by Hirota, the four plaintiffs and a group of supporters at a branch of Fukushima court in Iwaki, about 60 km south of the wrecked nuclear plant.",

Ainoshima has gained the nickname Cat Heaven Island, but while it may be a great place for scientists — and it has taught us a surprising amount about so familiar an animal — it is not perhaps the ideal place for cats. Feral cats are tough, and have tough lives. They live for just three to five years, compared with around 15 years for the average house cat. Yamane studied the cats in a six-hectare area on the south tip of the island, where there were six garbage patches. The cats arrange themselves in groups, based around ownership and control of the garbage patches. There is a strict hierarchy. “Male cats fight rivals to secure priority access to females in estrous (on heat),” Yamane says. “That ensures the males are more successful in mating and reproducing.” By trapping and tagging all the cats, Yamane found that the bigger and heavier a male in a group, the more access to females he secured. Big males also risked incursions into enemy territory — they visited other garbage heaps in attempts to mate with other females. “But these males were beaten there by smaller males of the other group, just like away supporters in a football game.” Very few “away team” copulations were observed. However, Yamane also took DNA samples of cats and kittens. The analysis showed that despite seeing few copulations between intruding males and females, there were actually far more kittens fathered from outside the group than expected. Females have more control over who fathers their kittens than you might think from the male-dominated structure of their society. Yamane says he often saw females dash away from their dominant males while the males were snoozing. “In many trials, females failed to escape, because males noticed the movement, but some attempts were successful,” he says. The reason for this, Yamane suspects, is to reduce the effects of inbreeding. When he started the study, Yamane says he had no special affection for cats. If anything, he had negative feelings about them, because some birds he kept when he was a child had been killed by cats. But he started to change his mind. He saw how different the life of a feral cat is to that of a house cat. Female cats had to compete to get enough food to feed their kittens. Life was tough and many kittens died through starvation, disease and even infanticide, as seen in lions. Male cats had to endure dangerous and damaging fights to get the chance to mate. “I found myself respecting them,” Yamane says. “After a while I grew to love them.” Yamane also observed many instances of male-on-male homosexual behavior. Often this would occur when a fertile female ran away from a courting male; sometimes the male would bite and mount a nearby immature male cat. It is hard to read this as “frustrated” actions on the part of the male — although Yamane says it is not yet fully understood. Yamane has just written a book drawing together his research on cats. “Neko no Himitsu” (“Secrets of the Cat”) was published this weekend by Bunshun Shinsho. Yamane says the book describes the life of both feral and household cats, from birth to death. One of the issues he considers is how to control the spread of feral cats. “Feral cats kill and eat endangered endemic wildlife,” he says, “and may even contribute to extinction.” There are some reports in Japan of feral cats reducing the population of wild birds, and they are suspected of spreading disease to the endemic wildcat, the Iriomote yamaneko . Japan deals with the issue by euthanizing kittens. In 2012 in Japan, some 120,000 cats were euthanized. In some European countries, the problem is tackled by trapping and neutering cats, and then releasing them, but while some local governments have recommended this in Japan, it hasn’t caught on. For Yamane the issue encapsulates other societal problems in Japan. In the olden days, he says — in the Edo Period (1603-1867) and Showa Era (1926-89) — people did not have enough surplus food to feed stray cats. Now they do, and they feed feral cats. We can’t go back to the olden days, but it is easy to stop feeding cats, he says. “A problem is that aged people living alone tend to constantly feed feral cats, because they have little contact with other people and feel lonely,” Yamane says. One of the consequences of a society where older people are lonely is that cats are overfed and reproduce at high rates, and their kittens have to be euthanized. For my part, I love cats, because despite the millenniums of domestic life, they retain impressive predatory characteristics. They are only a whisker away from being wild animals. Yamane feels the same. In his book, he outlines the characteristics of cats that we find so attractive: beauty, adaptability, a capricious nature, a sense of mystery, independence. Each of them, he says, are byproducts of evolution, the force of natural selection that created an efficient killer.",

    "source": "Can simplicity survive contact with complexity? <eos> “In the past this spacious Hokkaido was our ancestors’ world of freedom. Living with ease and pleasure in the manner of innocent babes in the embrace of beautiful, vast nature, they were truly beloved children of nature. Oh, what happy people they must have been!” “They have no history, their traditions are scarcely worthy of the name, they claim descent from a dog, their houses and persons swarm with vermin, they are sunk in the grossest ignorance …” “It is a great insult for the people of our prefecture (Okinawa) to be singled out for inclusion with Taiwanese tribesmen and (Hokkaido) Ainu. … We are being portrayed as an inferior race.” Hokkaido and Okinawa, poles apart climatically, have in common the sort of past that begs the question: Can human simplicity survive contact with human complexity? Both territories having failed to do so, and being now part of Japan in consequence, the answer seems clear. Maybe it is. Let’s explore it anyway. Related questions come to mind: Can weak nations coexist with strong ones? Does strength confer rights to which weakness must (and, therefore, should) yield? Is savagery a viable, even preferable alternative to civilization? If so, “savagery,” with its pejorative connotations, hardly seems the right word. What then? “Innocence?” Were Hokkaido and Okinawa “innocent” before Japan got its hands on them? Would they have been better off had Japan never encroached on them? If so, was Japan’s encroachment a crime? A sad truism: nations commit acts in the name of honor, glory and prosperity that, committed by individuals, would be judged criminal, if not monstrous. But nations are not individuals. Does that absolve them? Let’s consider Okinawa first, if only because Okinawa to this day harbors grievances whose modern manifestations have ancient roots. In 1591, Japan’s supreme warlord, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, having united most of his fractious country under his personal rule and feeling unabashedly omnipotent, wrote to the Ryukyu court as follows: “Throughout our nation of more than 60 provinces, I have pacified all people and governed with mercy and affection. … Consequently it is my desire to spread my administrations to other regions. … Henceforth, even if a land be thousands of miles distant, I shall … build with foreign lands the spirit of the four seas as one family.” Ryukyu, Okinawa’s original name, means “circle of jewels,” an apt description of a sprawling and lovely archipelago of 160-odd large and small islands, 48 of them inhabited. Agriculture came late — not before the 10th century. Local potentates ruled locally until the 15th century when one, stronger than the others, forced unification on recalcitrant former peers, somewhat staining a claim to moral superiority. Yet early in the 20th century the folklorist Kunio Yanagita (1875-1962) professed to see in Okinawa the pristine and divine purity that Japan proper had thrown away in its hell-bent drive to modernization. Traders the Ryukyuans were, their seaborne commerce mainly with China but extending all over East and South Asia. Hideyoshi, boundlessly bumptious, conceived a desire to conquer China. Why? Why not? A letter he wrote in1591 reads, “My country is secure. Nonetheless, it is my intention to govern China,” a feat “as easily done as pointing to the palm of my hand.” From the Ryukyus he demanded troops and provisions. Not daring to refuse outright, the Ryukyu king extended grudging and minimal cooperation — trade with China was his kingdom’s lifeline, after all — no doubt rejoicing when the expedition came to grief. It mattered little in the end. Ryukyu was doomed. It was too prosperous and too feeble to be left alone by a Japan whose newfound unity and burgeoning strength demanded an outlet. In 1609 came the almost effortless invasion — the end (in fact though not in name until 1879) of Ryukyu’s independent existence. Ironically, 30 years after the invasion, Japan, feeling threatened by Western powers, turned deeply inward, not emerging from its shell until the mid-1850s, when those same Western powers, led by the United States, treated Japan much as Japan had treated Okinawa. So that’s power politics. When has it ever been different? Well, take Hokkaido for instance. How could Yanagita have missed it? Here if anywhere primitive simplicity, noble savagery, natural goodness (is there is such a thing?) had a chance. If the ancient Ryukyuans were slow or reluctant to develop agriculture, Hokkaido’s Ainu were much more so, preserving a prehistoric hunting and gathering economy until well into the 19th century. Yukie Chiri, the early 20th-century Ainu writer quoted above (she died of heart disease at 19) was born too late to taste the primordial happiness she wrote about, but the oral tales on which she based herself (she is remembered as the first to have preserved them in writing) are too beautiful and too transparently joyful to be disregarded as evidence of the possibility that civilization may be more corrupting than beneficial — Isabella Bird notwithstanding. Bird is a fine observer, but she wouldn’t have known the tales, and her feelings in any case were mixed; she could not deny that there was something very fine about the Ainu after all. “They are uncivilizable and altogether irreclaimable savages,” Bird writes, “yet they are attractive and in some ways fascinating, and I hope I shall never forget the music of their low, sweet voices … and the wonderful sweetness of their smile.” Is this paradise lost? Were the Ainu “innocent babes,” as Chiri thought, or vermin-ridden savages, as they appeared to Bird? “Inferior race,” said the Ryukyu Shimpo — yet who today doesn’t see something admirable in their loving symbiosis with nature, their lack of greed, their ability to live in peace with one another? Hopeless, doomed. In the 16th century rumors swirled of gold to be found in the far north, and Japanese prospectors poured in. The rest, as they say, is history.",

    "source": "Importance of China trade not lost on Kansai leaders <eos> Judging by the frequent overheated rhetoric coming out of parts of the Japanese media, you’d think Japan and China were heading toward war. Of course, none of those now beating the drums for war will ever be drafted to fight. They are confident that, whatever happens, they’re part of the privileged class that will still be alive, and prospering, when the shooting is over. This is not to imply the warmongers are correct. However, given the rise in alarmist rhetoric of late, it’s clearer than ever that relations with China are far too important to be left to the likes of the Foreign and Defense ministries, let alone politicians or the media. For historical and cultural reasons, this is something Osaka understands. Anyone who deals with official Osaka will notice that the kind of crude, intense hatred toward China one finds in other parts of the country is often muted, or lacking entirely. Indeed, it’s more likely that opinions in Kansai on China and the Chinese people are more nuanced and subtle. Given China’s economic importance to the Kansai region as a whole, this is not surprising. It’s the destination of nearly a quarter of Kansai’s exports, and the source of nearly a third of its imports. One-third of Kansai International Airport’s 900-plus international flights this past summer went to China, whereas a mere 5 percent headed to the United States and Europe. Rule No. 1 in business is that you do not antagonize your best customers. Politically, local leaders have always had an “Asia first” policy, and you don’t get elected without the support of the China-centric, or at least Asia-centric, business community. Both the Kansai Economic Federation and the Kansai Association of Corporate Executives regularly send trade missions to all corners of China. Osaka Gov. Ichiro Matsui and Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto have made numerous trips to China and hosted senior leaders at home. New Komeito, which is quite strong in Osaka, has long pushed for good relations with China. Liberal Democratic Party politicians and their supporters in the region are often silent or accent the positive aspects of China. There is not, it seems, much political advantage in being seen as rabidly anti-China. What this means is that, despite the media rhetoric, Kansai leaders remain committed to better relations through trade, negotiation and compromise. They usually avoid provocative political statements and actions, instead engaging in behind-the-scenes discussions among Japanese and Chinese business partners who can then pressure their political leaders to tone things down. Yes, Hashimoto may at times make insensitive remarks about historical issues. But, compared with the more extreme members of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Cabinet, Hashimoto’s record shows he is not instinctively anti-China. Given that many of his supporters are upper-middle-class Japanese in their 30s and 40s who are frustrated with the old men who run the nation and look upon the success of young Chinese entrepreneurs with envy, this is hardly surprising. Is this “Osaka method” of China diplomacy doomed to failure, a victim of its own naivety, an amateur production of merchants who think that because they sell products to China they can run the Japan-China relationship better than the professional diplomats? Perhaps, but one needs to start somewhere. Many hope the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Beijing this November will include a summit between Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping. APEC is a forum ostensibly about trade, the perfect pretext for a businesslike tete-a-tete between the two leaders that can be built upon by those in Osaka and elsewhere who would rather talk about the benefits of trade and investment than the possibility of conflict. View from Osaka is a monthly column that examines the latest news from a Kansai perspective.",

She was 85. Doi, who served as a Lower House member for 12 terms from 1969 to 2005, led the predecessor of the SDP from 1986 to 1991 as the first female leader of a major Japanese political party. She again took the helm of the party in 1996, when it renamed itself, and continued in the post until 2003. A constitutional scholar, Doi was regarded as one of the highest-profile female pioneers in the male-dominated field of Japanese politics. In the July 1989 House of Councilors election, she played a key role in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party losing its majority in the chamber, as her tough, straight-talking manner appealed to voters, especially women. In that vote, Doi spearheaded a campaign opposing the introduction of the unpopular consumption tax that year, at a rate of 3 percent. “The mountain has moved,” she said after the election, a phrase that would be widely circulated among the public and symbolize the emerging power of women in politics and the weakening of the LDP. “Ms. Doi has passed away. . . . (She) persuaded me to run (for a Diet seat) in 1998, and I decided to run to defend the Constitution,” Mizuho Fukushima, an Upper House member and former SDP chief herself, tweeted Sunday. “It’s really shocking, as if my mother in politics has died.” Doi graduated from Doshisha University’s Graduate School of Law and was the first woman to become speaker of the powerful House of Representatives, a position she served in from 1993 to 1996. In 1996, she again became head of her party, but resigned in 2003 to take responsibility for the its trouncing in that year’s general election. After failing to win a seat in the 2005 Lower House election, Doi retired from politics. The SDP, once the country’s most powerful opposition party, was a driving force behind social democratic and pacifist movements, but its fortunes have waned in recent years and it is now a minor opposition party with just a handful of Diet lawmakers.",

Prosecutor Claudio Orellana said the unknown young man “had been manipulating a homemade explosive artefact, and in those circumstance, it blew up on him” at about 1 a.m. Witnesses posted online photos of the man in flames before he was taken to an emergency clinic where he died. Doctors at the clinic said the man was gravely injured as well as burned. He was not identified, but was believed to be about 30 years old. Officials say anarchist cells have planted some 200 bombs around Santiago over the past decade, and 30 so far this year. The only other fatality was also a man believed to be planting an explosive. President Michelle Bachelet, who was visiting the United Nations, described the bombings as “terrorist acts, but isolated.” The explosion comes two days after three alleged anarchists appeared in court and were ordered held on suspicion of planting at least four bombs, including one that injured 14 people at a shopping area near a subway stop this month. Interior Minister Rodrigo Penailillo said that the design of new bomb appears to differ with that used in the subway blast.",

    "source": "Mihama viewed as test case for Japan's aging nuclear reactors <eos> In recognition of Japan’s rapidly aging nuclear plants, Kansai Electric Power Co. has begun discussing the possibility of decommissioning the Mihama No. 1 and No. 2 reactors, now more than 40 years old, in Fukui Prefecture. While Kepco officials insist no decision has been made, scrapping them instead of applying for a two-decade extension could set a precedent for other prefectures where older plants that went online in the 1970s and early 1980s, like the ill-fated Fukushima No. 1 plant, now face more stringent safety regulations, posing huge expenditures for any utility interested in keeping them. The two Mihama reactors in question went into service in 1970 and 1972 and generate a combined 840,000 kw, a small amount compared with modern atomic units, which can generate over 1 million kw each. Japan’s maximum operating life span for a reactor stands at 40 years. After that, utilities can apply for a one-time, 20-year extension or commence a decommissioning process that can take up to three decades. It’s a tough choice, one that effects not only consumers, but also the municipalities hosting the plants and the utilities running them. Keeping reactors online beyond 40 years is expected to become extremely expensive. In addition to the basic costs of meeting the new safety standards that took effect last year, the places hosting them are sure to place additional demands on utilities and the central government — demands that will require further funding and negotiations that will further delay reactivation. In the case of the Mihama reactors, though, even if a 20-year extension were granted, it’s unclear whether the cost of running them would be recouped by the time the reactors reach the age of 60. If not, that means more red ink on Kepco’s bottom line, and pressure on the government to pass off the losses to the end users in the Kansai region. Time is running out to make a decision. Accordng to the government, any utilities wishing to continue running reactors past the 40-year threshold as of July 2016 will have to undergo an extra inspection, for which applications must be submitted by July 2015. Utilities that apply will have to calculate the financial and political costs over the next two decades. If they end up receiving state approval for an extension, they have to hope that the electricity from the reactors will generate enough revenue to cover all of the additional costs, both projected and unforeseen, without significantly denting their bottom line. Otherwise, they will have to start the dismantling process. Yet decommissioning also involves big money. Utilities estimate that scrapping a single reactor will cost at least ¥50 billion, assuming that all goes as planned. By 2016, all three of Kepco’s Mihama reactors, as well as two of its four reactors at the Takahama plant, also in Fukui Prefecture, will be over 40 years old. This means Kepco must choose whether to dismantle or try to extend the lives of five of its 11 operating reactors. On top of that, its No. 1 and No. 2 reactors at the Oi power station in Fukui will reach the 37-year mark in 2016, requiring another decision in the next couple of years. For its part, the government has said it will provide some form of financial support to the utilities if reactors become subject to decommissioning or fail safety inspections and remain shut down. “The utilities will decide whether to decommission individual reactors, but the government will support a smooth decommissioning process along with the restart of reactors whose safety has been guaranteed,” new economy, trade and industry minister Yuko Obuchi said earlier this month. Whatever decision Kepco arrives at, it will have a huge impact on Fukui Prefecture, where all 11 of the utility’s reactors are situated. Since the mid-1970s, Fukui has received around ¥400 billion in nuclear power-related subsidies from the central government. Of this, about ¥190 billion has gone directly to towns such as Mihama that rely on the money to build roads, bridges, dams and sewage systems as well as community centers and other social welfare facilities. Officials visiting the host municipalities for regular inspections by the Nuclear Regulation Authority, the industry’s new watchdog, as well as utility personnel, help fill local hotels, inns and restaurants, and support a variety of local service industries. Concerned about what a future without nuclear subsidies might mean, Fukui Gov. Issei Nishikawa met with Obuchi on Sept. 9, just days after she was appointed industry minister, and asked her for additional funding for a variety of infrastructure projects, as well as a guarantee that atomic-related funding would ensure that reactors are completely decommissioned and removed. “It’s up to the central government to explain how it will take responsibility for securing a storage facility for the spent fuel from decommissioned reactors, for building a disposal facility for their radioactive waste, for ensuring the physical safety of the area hosting the reactor, and for dealing with the industrial and economic effects of decommissioning,” Nishikawa said. While Fukui is concerned, others in Kansai who have long worried about the reactors, especially their age, greeted the news of possible decommissioning with relief. Aileen Mioko Smith of Kyoto-based Green Action, an anti-nuclear group, said tearing down the reactors would set a good precedent but added that it is critical to include local participation in the process. “Local communities should be given the opportunity to enter the decommissioning business rather than again become subcontractors to huge conglomerates,” she said, referring to the general contractors that built the plants.",

    "source": "Politicians discuss plan B in nuclear power push: underground reactors <eos> For more than four decades, the Kansai region has relied on Fukui Prefecture’s nuclear power plants, including 11 operated by Kansai Electric Power Co. (Kepco), to keep the region powered up. But now that a growing number of plants are nearing or have reached the end of their 40-year life cycle, the question is: What’s next? While most of the discussion is focused on whether to continue running or decommission them, there is an interesting — to be polite — school of thought among certain politicians that says they should be replaced with underground reactors. Don’t laugh (or cry). The idea has intrigued some very influential people, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He, along with several other prominent politicians from the Liberal Democratic Party, the Democratic Party of Japan, and Nippon Ishin no Kai (Japan Restoration Party), formed a Diet group in May 2011 to study the issues involved. One of the most ardent backers is LDP Lower House member Taku Yamamoto. He represents Fukui Prefecture’s second district, where several towns host nuclear power plants. His wife, Internal Affairs and Communications Minister Sanae Takaichi, has also participated in the Diet group on underground reactors. “The accident at Fukushima No. 1 wouldn’t have occurred if the plant had been underground,” Yamamoto told a press conference in June 2011. “Even if we suppose it had occurred, the damage would have been minimal. Natural energy is ideal, but we can’t guarantee sufficient electricity generation with it using today’s technologies,” he continued. “In order to maintain Japan’s international competitiveness, underground nuclear reactors are necessary.” Aside from the obvious questions — such as “Are these people crazy?” and “Who are the contractors specializing in underground construction that are funding them?” — lies the question of whether the idea is even remotely realistic. Technologically, the answer seems to be yes. In an interview with The Associated Press in April, William Magwood, new head of the Paris-based Nuclear Energy Agency, an intergovernmental entity organized under the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, suggested using small underground reactors to produce fractional amounts of electricity at a much cheaper cost. In the United States, the Energy Department has spent $450 million trying to convince U.S. firms to develop small underground reactors, and the idea even has the support of people like Microsoft founder Bill Gates. But concerns about funding, regulation and fears of nuclear proliferation have all slowed the effort. All of these issues, and more, apply to Japan, and the conventional wisdom might be that the idea is far too bizarre to be taken seriously. But given the interest in the Diet, the fact that many important people in Fukui and Kepco want to keep nuclear-related subsidies flowing, and given that other prefectures with aging plants are also worried about the future, underground nuclear power plants might just become one of those crazy ideas that find enough influential backing to become reality. What could possibly go wrong?",

The three cities have produced a total of 526 tons of such waste, according to NHK. While the central government is supposed to build final disposal facilities for designated nuclear waste, the prefectural government is also asking the three cities to bring the waste back to their own municipalities and dispose of it on their own, if the central government fails to build a disposal facility by next March, the broadcaster reported.

To make matters worse, there is no natural shelter for the ships near the zone of the blockade, so that they have to be kept at a fixed point and held steadily to windward to avoid being caught by the strong gales from either side. The destroyers are engaged in their blockade duty amid intense difficulties, seeming to an untrained eye to be almost at the mercy of the angry waters. It is all the more satisfactory, therefore, to record that not one of the vessels has suffered any damage to speak of. The seas have been swept of mines to within 10,000 meters of Kiaochou (Jiaozhou) Bay, so that the bay is within range of the Japanese guns, the Tokyo Mainichi reports. The Siege of Tsingtao, in which Japan and Britain attacked the German-leased territory of Kiaochou Bay, marked Japan’s entry into World War I. The Japanese and British forces prevailed on Nov. 7, 1914. 75 YEARS AGO Sunday, Sept. 3, 1939 German Army enters Poland, controls air The General Headquarters of the German Army at 5:45 p.m. today announced that German troops from East Prussia had advanced deep into Poland, while the Reich air force is in complete mastery of the air. The advance of German troops in Silesia, Pomerania and East Prussia is proceeding according to all expectations, the communique said. Troops entering Poland through Silesia are advancing near Czestochowa, approximately 20 miles (32 km) from the border, while German units are nearing Nake, on the Nteze River, 80 miles inside the frontier. Heavy fighting is going on near Graudenz, while forces advancing from East Prussia are fighting far into Polish territory, the communique stated. Meanwhile the German air force has bombed and destroyed numerous airports. With normal transportation at a standstill and the streets empty of people, complete darkness reigned over Berlin tonight as protection against surprise foreign bombings. Officials of the German Air Raids Precautions, while issuing instructions in the event of bombings, announced that all those who failed to obey instructions would be arrested. The Ministerial Council for Defense tonight issued its first decree prohibiting the population from listening to foreign news broadcasts under penalty of hard labor. 50 YEARS AGO Wednesday, Sept. 16, 1964 Olympic Village opens ahead of 1964 Games The main Olympic Village in Yoyogi and four branch villages opened Tuesday morning. About 1,300 Japanese and foreign Olympic officials, athletes and interpreters were present at the official opening of the main village. The Olympic fanfare was sounded under the flags of the 98 nations taking part in the games, which will commence next month. Speeches were given by Daigoro Yasukawa, secretary-general of the Tokyo Olympic Organizing Committee; Ichiro Kono, state minister in charge of Olympic affairs and others. Seven helicopters loaded with photographers droned overhead during the ceremony, often drowning out the speakers. Among those attending the ceremony were 51 foreign Olympic delegates, who were the first to enter the 66-hectare main village. Eventually, some 8,000 foreign and Japanese Olympic athletes and officials will live there for the games. The main village, which had been occupied by the U.S. Forces in Japan as one of their housing areas (Washington Heights) for 17 years until last December, is only a stone’s throw from the Olympic Indoor Stadium and about 2 km from the main stadium in Yoyogi. The village will remain open until Nov. 5. After the opening ceremony, participants had an “Olympic lunch” at the village’s Fuji Dining Hall to get a taste of what Olympic athletes will eat during the games. At noon, the Olympic Milk and Ice Cream Bar was formally opened at the village. The first Olympic Milk and Ice Cream Bar was established at Squaw Valley during the 1960 winter Olympic Games. Simultaneously with the Olympic Village opening, the Metropolitan Police Department opened its special Olympic security headquarters within the MPD office Thursday morning. During the 52-day period the village is open, the MPD will mobilize an average of 5,000 policemen for security and traffic control for the Olympics. 25 YEARS AGO Friday, Sept. 1, 1989 Agency seeks funds to compile Imperial annals The Imperial Household Agency will request nearly ¥47 million in fiscal 1990 to start compiling the official biographical record for Emperor Hirohito (known posthumously as Emperor Showa). Officials said the official biographical record will take 16 years and will be completed in 2005. The record will consist of 18 volumes and will cover all 87 years of his life. Emperor Showa reigned for 62 years until January 1989. Ten officials of the Compiling Division of the agency’s Archives and Mausolea Department will interview people who were close to Emperor Showa and use various documents in the possession of the agency to write the record. Compilation work for the official record of Emperor Meiji, who reigned 45 years from 1867 to 1912, started in 1915 and ended in 1933. The 13-volume record was published in 1967. The first eight years in the project will be spent gathering former chamberlains’ diaries, court physicians’ medical records and the records of Emperor Showa’s travels. The next five will be dedicated to writing the record and the following three years to editing and revisions. After two extensions, the annals were completed this year and are due for disclosure in September.",

    "source": "Obama: No nation gets 'free pass' on climate change <eos> UNITED NATIONS - In a forceful appeal for international cooperation on limiting carbon pollution, President Barack Obama warned starkly on Tuesday that the globe’s climate is changing faster than efforts to address it. “Nobody gets a pass,” he declared. “We have to raise our collective ambition.” Speaking at a United Nations summit, Obama said the United States is doing its part and that it will meet its goal to cut carbon pollution 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. He also announced modest new U.S. commitments to address climate change overseas. The summit aims to galvanize support for a global climate treaty to be finalized next year. But Obama’s strongest comments came as he sought to unify the international conclave behind actions to reduce global warming. “The alarm bells keep ringing, our citizens keep marching,” he said. “We can’t pretend we can’t hear them. We need to answer the call. We need to cut carbon emission in our countries to prevent worse effects, adapt and work together as global community to tackle this global threat before it is too late.” He said the U.S. and China as the largest polluters have a responsibility to lead. But, Obama added, “No nation can meet this global threat alone.” More than 120 world leaders gathered on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to organize support for a global climate treaty to be finalized next year in Paris. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the summit’s host, asked representatives of nations to come to New York with specific pledges in hand to mitigate climate change, as a way to show they’re serious about ambitious emissions reductions in the treaty. Obama’s goals at the summit: to convince other nations that the U.S. is doing its part to curb greenhouse gases, and make the case that other major polluters should step up, too. “It’s very clear to the international community that the president is extending considerable political capital at home in order to implement his climate plan, and that’s true,” said Nigel Purvis, a U.S. climate negotiator in the administrations of presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. “The hope is that when we take action, others will do so as well.” Some of the tools the U.S. will offer developing nations were developed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey and are intended to help communities use data modeling, forecasting and science to anticipate the effects of climate change and make decisions about the best way to deal with it. Secretary of State John Kerry also announced that the U.S. would contribute $15 million to a World Bank program designed to stimulate funding for projects that reduce methane pollution. But the commitments were modest compared to what some had hoped the U.S. would put forth to show its commitment. By midmorning, other nations attending the summit had pledged at least $5 billion to help the world become more sustainable. And the development organization Oxfam argued that the U.S. Agency for International Development already incorporates climate change resiliency in its programs. The one-day climate summit isn’t formally part of the ongoing negotiations toward the climate treaty, which leaders hope will be more muscular than a lackluster agreement reached in Copenhagen in 2009. The idea is that by involving heads of state early, rather than leaving it to negotiators until the very end, prospects will improve for reaching a strong deal. In another attempt to increase political pressure on leaders to take action, tens of thousands of activists, including prominent actors and former Vice President Al Gore, demonstrated in New York on Sunday.",

    "source": "Tokyo's storied Nihonbashi raises profile to promote historical role <eos> The Nihonbashi district prospered as Japan’s financial and trade center after shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital to Edo, the old name for Tokyo, in the early 17th century. Its geographical advantage contributed to fast-track development. Nihonbashi was the starting point of five major roads at the time, which linked the new capital to outlying regions beyond the Kanto plain, allowing the district to thrive as businesses built footholds in the area. Now that more than 400 years have passed, Nihonbashi is trying to maintain its relevance by making efforts to transform the old merchant center into a place where tourists can learn about Japanese culture and traditions. Coredo Muromachi, a shopping complex that opened this spring near Mitsukoshimae subway station, showcases outlets of long-established stores that market local delicacies and other merchandise from around the nation. The complex has foreign staff on standby to assist foreign tourists. On July 19, two of the guides, Alia Carter, a 26-year-old American, and Spaniard Paloma Free, 28, helped foreign tourists while dressed in traditional kimono. Carter is working after finishing her JET program, and Free is attending Japanese school. Three other foreigners are part of the team. Two of the visitors that day were Terrie Wright Chrones, a 62-year-old food writer, and English teacher Charles Robert Hixon III, 61, both from the United States. Both are fans of Japanese cuisine. After a 90-minute tour of the complex, each said the guides’ detailed explanations helped them better understand Japanese culture and get a feel for “omotenashi,” Japan’s brand of customer hospitality. The English tours of Coredo Muromachi start at 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Saturdays, cost ¥1,000 and last about 90 minutes. Souvenirs are included.

    "source": "Emperor, councilors weigh war declaration; simplified Japanese created for foreigners; Russian musicians defect; foreigners' office hears thousands of problems <eos> 100 YEARS AGO Sunday, Aug. 16 1914 Emperor, councilors weigh war declaration The Emperor of Japan, his councilors and his Ministers met yesterday in the Grand Council Chamber of the Palace to consider the most momentous question such august councils are ever called upon to decide. For the third time in the history of Japan, the discussion turned upon whether Japan should declare herself in a state of war or whether further effort should be made to find some honorable way to avoid it. For the last week, Dame Rumor has had the stage to herself. In official circles something more than what is commonly called a discreet silence has been maintained. The newspapers have openly stated that “on good authority it is said that Japan is going to declare war upon Germany,” but no confirmation or denial of those statements has been forthcoming. The grand council went into session at four o’clock, with the Emperor himself presiding. It adjourned around six o’clock. The faces of those who came and went were grave, but beyond this there was no indication that Japan is on the eve of a declaration of war. Japan officially entered World War I on Aug. 23, when it declared war on Germany, citing its commitments to Britain as set out in the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902. 75 YEARS AGO Friday, Aug. 4, 1939 Simplified Japanese created for foreigners A system of basic Japanese, employing 1,776 words, was recently evolved by linguistic experts at the National Language Society, enabling foreigners to learn the tongue with more ease. Almost anything can be expressed by the new system, though complicated matters have to be put in a roundabout way because of the limited vocabulary. Yoshimi Ishiguro, an Esperantist who is on the Basic Japanese Committee of the National Language Society, rewrote Kan Kikuchi’s famous play “Father Returns” using just 1,700 words. Dictionaries and other books are being edited under the new system by the linguistic society. Mr. Ishiguro considers it more advisable to send abroad books written in basic Japanese than translations in English or other European languages. Because the system is easy to learn for foreigners, books in basic will serve to popularize Japanese abroad as well as to acquaint the foreigners with things Japanese more directly than through translations. The Basic Japanese Committee was organized in March last year with the assistance of the Education Ministry. The 1,776 words were selected after a careful survey of words used in magazine, newspaper articles and books. The committee held discussions to select most representative words from groups of synonyms. 50 YEARS AGO Sunday, Aug. 16, 1964 Russians defect, seek help at U.S. Embassy Two Soviet musicians, missing since Friday, defected Saturday and asked the U.S. Embassy for help in seeking asylum. The two Russians, members of the Bolshoi Variety Troupe now touring Japan, were reported inside the U.S. Embassy, but an embassy spokesman would neither confirm nor deny this. Nathaniel Thayer, embassy press attache, said in a statement late Saturday night: “Two Soviet citizens, Igor Berucshtis and Boris Midney, have informed the officers of the American Embassy they do not wish to return to the Soviet Union and desire to seek refuge elsewhere.” Soviet Embassy officials went to the U.S. Embassy at about 8:30 p.m., Kyodo News Service reported, but neither embassy would comment on any conference that took place. This was the second defection involving a Soviet citizen in Japan since the end of World War II. In 1954, Yuri Rastvorov, considered the chief spy at the Soviet Embassy, sought asylum at the U.S. Embassy and was taken out of Japan secretly, which caused an uproar here. The U.S. later offered apologies. The two men were reported missing early Saturday morning by the Cultural Exchange Association, the private organization sponsoring the Bolshoi Variety’s tour here, to the Takanawa Police Station. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department identified the two men as Igor Berecshtis, 31, contrabassist, and Boris Midney, 28, drummer. There was no known reason for the defection. The men were granted asylum and issued travel documents with which they left Japan, bound for Europe, on Aug. 16, 1964. 25 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Aug. 1, 1989 Foreigners’ office hears thousands of problems The Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s foreign residents’ advisory center received a total of 2,173 inquiries in the year since it was set up in July 1988. By the end of June, foreigners from 56 countries had come to the center with their problems. Among the foreigners who sought advice from the center by telephone, mail or visit, 537 were Americans, 172 were Chinese and 95 were Canadians. The center also handled the inquiries of 148 Japanese who had problems with foreign residents. Common inquiries brought to the center concerned immigration regulations, job contracts, driver’s licenses, the tax system, housing regulations, Japanese-language schools, and marriage and divorce, according to a spokesman for the center. Sachiko Yamamoto, an English-language advisor, said language-school teachers are prone to encounter problems involving job contracts because “many of them make contracts carelessly and assert many rights once a problem occurs.” “They should accept the Japanese way of giving in and not asserting their rights all the time. Otherwise, it makes the matter worse,” she said.",

    "source": "How much do you know about dengue fever? <eos> The health ministry has confirmed the first domestic dengue fever case in Japan in nearly 70 years. A Saitama Prefecture teen girl was found Wednesday to have contracted the virus through a mosquito in Japan, followed by news that two more people — a man and a woman in Tokyo — have also been infected. More than 200 dengue cases are reported in Japan each year, but those are of patients who contracted dengue virus abroad. The World Health Organization estimates the number of infections across the globe to be 50 million to 100 million per year. While the news has led to widespread fears that a pandemic outbreak might have arrived, experts are quick to deny such a scenario, while offering some advice on what measures people can take to minimize their exposure. Following are some basic questions and answers regarding the infectious disease and measures that can be taken to prevent infection. What is dengue fever and what causes it? Dengue fever is a tropical viral disease, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever or break-bone fever, which is caused by dengue virus. It is said that dengue fever can be caused by any of the four closely related types of dengue virus: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4. So far, it is not clear which of the four types that the three latest patients in Japan contracted, though the three probably came down with the same virus type, according to Koichi Morita, professor of virology at the Nagasaki University’s Institute of Tropical Medicine. While its origin remains unclear, the disease was named “dengue” as early as in 1801, according to Scitable, an online science education portal run by the Nature Publishing Group. The word dengue is Spanish for “affectation,” “careful,” or “fastidious,” and was probably used to describe the cautious, stiff movements of patients suffering from the muscle, bone and joint pains, Scitable said. How is the virus transmitted? Dengue viruses are carried and transmitted to humans by several species of female mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is found mainly in tropical and sub-tropical climates, is deemed the primary vector of dengue. It can be transmitted by Aedes albopictus, also called the Asian tiger mosquito, which is prevalent in Japan. Although the viruses cannot be transmitted directly from humans, transmission is possible through the bite of an infected mosquito. What are the symptoms? The main symptoms observed in patients diagnosed with dengue fever are high fever, joint and muscle pain and rash. They can be accompanied by headache, weakness, nausea, vomiting and bleeding. The incubation period ranges from two or three days to two weeks, but in most cases symptoms develop within a week after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Because the symptoms are often confused with those caused by influenza or other viral infections, milder symptoms in patients can go unnoticed, Morita said. A 46-year-old woman from Tokyo, who was diagnosed with dengue fever about 20 years ago upon returning from a trip to Thailand, said it is vital for people who travel abroad not to neglect symptoms and, upon their return, to undergo quarantine checks at the airport in Japan if they are feeling sick. Because she waited until she came back to Japan to see a doctor, she said she suffered from severe symptoms and needed to receive a blood transfusion. She said she now regrets not visiting a doctor in Thailand while she was there. What treatments exist? Currently no vaccines or effective drugs exist, and most patients are only given drugs to lower their fever. Morita said, however, the recovery from infection by one of the virus’ serotypes provides lifelong immunity against that particular serotype. If patients are left unattended, they could later develop more severe symptoms, such as internal bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage. What are the measures to prevent from infection? Given the significant increase in dengue infections worldwide plus the number of imported cases, Morita emphasized the importance of defending against dengue-carrying mosquitoes on an individual basis. Because transmission is likely in all areas of the country, it is important to protect one’s skin with long-sleeved shirts and full length pants, or by using insect repellent.",

    "source": "What kind of life could live in the clouds? <eos> Do you remember seeing clouds from an airplane for the first time? Even if that first time was as an adult, you were probably struck by the appearance of solidity. Seen from above, a cloudscape looks like a landscape — it looks like a place where things might live. At school we learn that clouds aren’t solid: They are just made of water vapor. And when the amount of water in a cloud reaches a certain point, it becomes too heavy to stay suspended in the air, and falls down: It rains. The process, we are told, is a physical one. Condensation, cooling, saturation, precipitation. How thrilling, then, to learn that the world is a more complicated place. To a whole range of organisms, clouds are places to live. To microbes, clouds are not just landscapes: They are ecosystems. Even more than that, precipitation — the act of rain and snow falling out of the sky — seems to be biological. Rain, you could say, is bacteria’s way of getting out of the sky. Kim Prather at the University of California, San Diego, studies these aerial ecosystems. She and her team fly in special research planes over the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of the United States. You may have seen biologists chasing butterflies and dragonflies with insect nets; what Prather is doing is the equivalent in a cloud. Her team takes samples of clouds and analyzes the content. “We’re seeing lots of biological components such as bacteria and molecules associated with microbial life,” she says. It’s not the first time microbes have been found to be present in the atmosphere. A few years ago I interviewed Brent Christner of Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge. He had collected fresh snow from diverse locations in the United States, France and Antarctica, and in all samples he found evidence that bacteria were not only present, but that they had been influential in actually causing the snow to fall in the first place. How on Earth can that be? Rain falls when something “seeds” the development of ice crystals in a cloud. Tiny particles cause ice to form and grow, and eventually it will fall. If it warms up enough as it falls, it will be rain. Sometimes ice crystals themselves are the catalyst for growth, and sometimes ice grows around tiny particles of dust. Prather’s group is directly sampling from the clouds over the Pacific to find out more details. Last week she presented her work at the American Chemical Society meeting in San Francisco. Her starting point is the understanding that the atmosphere is chock-full of dust and other particles, and that bacteria, algae and fungi live there too. Understanding the exact chemical makeup of the dust and the biological molecules on it helps understand and predict how rain and snow fall from clouds. How, when and how much — crucial information for farmers, and for us all. “The standard belief is the more ice you have in a cloud, the more likely you will get precipitation out of it,” Prather says. “Our goal is to catch the first stages of ice forming and find out what exactly the chemical constituents are that the ice is forming on.” What they have found is that the ice crystals have biological markers. They have proteins that can’t be derived from dust particles in the air, but that are signatures of bacterial life in the atmosphere. “We’ve learned that not all of the particles in the air at high altitudes have the same influence on clouds. We’re starting to think that these differences contribute to how rain gets distributed,” says Prather. Most of the dust that Prather’s team detects in clouds and precipitation originates in deserts in Asia. It gets swept westward by the jet stream, where it mixes with other airborne particles, including smoke and spray from the sea. Prather says that each of these types of particles — collectively known as aerosols — has its own, distinctive impact on clouds. But living on the particles are varieties of microbes. The microbes make proteins, which lace water molecules together. The water forms a pattern similar to an ice crystal’s lattice, which encourages ice to form. Ice crystals then grow in the normal way, and rain — or snow — falls. A long-term goal of Prather’s research is to improve cloud-seeding technology. This was most publicly used just before the Beijing Olympics in 2008 to ensure clear skies for the opening ceremony. But the techniques are not always reliable. “Mother Nature has developed very effective ways to seed clouds, so perhaps we could take some tips from her,” says Prather. Evidence, if any more was needed, of the extraordinary power of natural selection. All organisms need to be able to disperse and find new areas to live. After staying alive and reproducing, dispersal is the third most important item on any organism’s to-do list. It seems a range of organisms have found a way to manipulate weather systems to help them do that. There are occasionally reports of masses of frogs raining out of the sky, or of fish falling in the desert. In Kerala, in southern India, there was an infamous occurrence of red rain, which had some people speculating that alien life forms had rained down from space when a meteor exploded in the atmosphere. It turned out to be red algae that had been swept into the air after a storm, just like when frogs and fish are swept up on freak air currents. But the finding that there are organisms that live for at least part of their life cycle in the atmosphere — that is as wonderful as stories about magical creatures that live in the clouds, and all the more impressive for being true.",

    "source": "Kepco: the monstrous 500-pound gorilla of Kansai <eos> Last month, Chimori Naito, a 91-year-old former vice president at Kansai Electric Power Co., admitted what was hardly a secret but which put the utility under intense media scrutiny. Naito said in a series of interviews with the Asahi Shimbun that he supervised under-the-table cash payments to seven prime ministers and key politicians in the ruling and opposition parties between 1972 and 1990 to ensure favorable policies, especially nuclear power policies. Naito guessed Kepco’s annual payoffs were in the hundreds of millions of yen. Kepco got its money’s worth. Prior to March 11, 2011, Japan relied on nuclear power for about a third of its electricity needs. But half of Kepco-supplied electricity came from nuclear power. Fukui Prefecture became home to 11 Kepco reactors, the largest concentration in the country and, perhaps, the world. And it was Kepco’s two Oi reactors that were switched back on in the summer of 2012 despite massive public opposition. In terms of local economic presence, Kepco is the 500-pound gorilla. The company employs more than 22,000 people directly (and, indirectly, thousands more), has nearly 40 affiliated firms, and owns shares in about a dozen local public-relations facilities. These often take the form of “educational museums” that promote nuclear power. It also has small investments in Kansai-area television and radio stations. All of this makes Kepco similar to Japan’s other utilities. But over the past two decades, as other Kansai firms moved to Tokyo or overseas, Kepco has consolidated its power and influence over regional politics and policymaking to a degree unprecedented elsewhere, and in ways not always obvious to outsiders or Kansai residents. Senior Kepco officials serve as top representatives of hugely influential organizations such as the Kansai Economic Federation, which draws up regional political and economic strategies, and serves as a de facto political lobbying group in Tokyo. A Kepco chairman has led the federation for 27 of its 68 years, and Shosuke Mori, Kepco’s current chairman, presently heads it. Many of Kansai’s failed public works projects funded by Osaka were strongly backed by the federation. In addition, why was the barely used second runway at Kansai airport constructed despite criticism it was a waste of public funds? You can thank a local airport promotion group headed by Kepco’s chairman. Given that Kepco has long provided direct election support, in the form of company “volunteers,” to local LDP candidates, the fact Kepco-favored plans usually become reality is hardly surprising. Ideas promoted by Kepco-led organizations have several common traits. First, they tend to result in massive physical structures (buildings, transportation systems) that, obviously, require Kepco-generated electricity to run and maintain — nuclear-generated electricity, of course, not renewables. Second, they are often based on the “Kepco School of Management,” a mixture of top-down, centralized planning among a select few men over the age of 60 who decide what’s best for the local economy — and for themselves. The result of this Kepco-influenced Kansai economy since the mid-1990s has largely been one of stagnation, an accelerated shift to Tokyo of local money and talent, and a sense the gap between Kansai and other regions in East Asia in particular is growing. This is a major reason why Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto hates Kepco and publicly criticizes it. But Kansai’s 500-pound gorilla remains as strong as ever, and despite the recent media attention, looks set to remain so for years to come. Which makes one wonder: Will we be reading, in 30 years, about how some Kepco official paid off Liberal Democratic Party officials to help ensure the return of Shinzo Abe and the LDP? View from Osaka is a monthly column that examines the latest news from a Kansai perspective.",

Myanmar, which only recently emerged from a half century of military rule and self-imposed isolation, started sending contestants to international beauty pageants for the first time in decades in 2012. May Myat Noe was crowned Miss Asia Pacific World in Seoul in May 2014. But, according to David Kim, director of media for the Seoul-based pageant, the 18-year-old was a disappointment from the start. Attempts to reach May Myat Noe for comment were unsuccessful Friday and her Myanmar phone was switched off. According to the online edition of Eleven Media, a Myanmar newspaper, she was back in the country and would address a news conference soon, although it wasn’t clear when. Following her success, the organizers said they were arranging singing and video deals for her. But they also wanted to change the looks of the 5’7″ (170-cm) teen, Kim said. “We thought she should be more beautiful . . . so as soon as she arrived we sent her to the hospital to operate on her breasts,” he said. “It’s our responsibility,” he said, adding that sponsors picked up the $10,000 tab, as they have for past winners. “If she has no good nose, then maybe, if she likes, we can operate on her nose. If it’s breasts, then breasts.” Kim said that the troubles started from there. The beauty queen brought her mother with her to Seoul for what was supposed to be a 10-day visit, but that quickly turned into three months, incurring extra costs for the organizers, he said. She “lied” and “never had respect for the main organization, the national director, the manager, media or fans who made her the winner,” organizers said in a statement. May Myat Noe was notified earlier this week that she would have to give up her title and the crown, Kim said. She was also given an airplane ticket back to Yangon, but never showed up, with Eleven Media reporting that she got on an earlier flight. Kim said she absconded with the bejeweled Swarovski tiara — valued anywhere between $100,000 and $200,000. “Everyone knows she is no longer the queen, but she thinks as long as she keeps this crown she’s the winner,” he said. “She’s not.”",

The challenge, going viral on social media, involves donating a bucket of rice to someone in need and clicking a picture to share online, with a tag #RiceBucketChallenge, to raise awareness. Started by 38-year-old journalist Manju Latha Kalanidhi in the southern city of Hyderabad, the movement’s Facebook page ( on.fb.me/1tASxph ) defines it as a “local challenge for local needs” and has clocked more than 52,000 ‘likes’ so far. The inspiration was drawn from the “ice bucket” challenge, in which people pour a bucket of ice-cold water over their heads to encourage donations for research into Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a neurodegenerative disease. Celebrities such as software tycoon Bill Gates and tennis great Roger Federer have participated. “I felt (the ice bucket challenge) was a little bizarre … hunger is a disease anybody would connect with,” Kalanidhi told Reuters. Kalanidhi’s project has started to draw mass support. Students of the Indian Institute of Management in the southern state of Kerala posted a video ( bit.ly/1pp3uer ) after donating rice, while budget airline AirAsia India said its chief executive and senior management will participate on Monday. Mass hunger, much of it poverty-induced, continues to haunt India. The country last year ranked 63rd on a list of 78 countries tracked by the International Food Policy Research Institute’s Global Hunger Index. China ranked sixth. Tackling poverty is high on new Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s agenda. On Thursday, he launched a banking-for-all scheme that he said should end “financial untouchability” and help lift people out of poverty. India is the world’s second-biggest rice consumer, with reserves of 21.2 million tons of the grain by July 1. It was the world’s biggest rice exporter last year.",

But back in Osaka, he, and his local political group Osaka Ishin no Kai (One Osaka), the largest party, find themselves unable to make headway on the very reason for Hashimoto’s political existence: the integration of the Osaka municipal and prefectural governments. Last month, angry at the way Hashimoto was attempting to override opposition in both the city and prefectural assemblies, where the opposition parties hold the majority, both legislative bodies passed resolutions that effectively declare Hashimoto’s merger proposal null and void. Without the assemblies’ cooperation, putting the merger plan to a public referendum is impossible. The staunch opposition of the other parties, including the Liberal Democratic Party and New Komeito, Osaka Ishin’s nominal coalition ally, creates a bind for the pro-merger camp, especially the younger legislators in Osaka Ishin who entered politics because of Hashimoto and rode his coattails to victory. Lacking deep connections, a popular base of support, name power and, most importantly, big war chests, many of Hashimoto’s young municipal and prefectural assembly members face tough re-election bids next spring unless a referendum on the merger — or a clear schedule for one — can be set by then. One of the fundamental problems for the local opposition parties, especially the LDP and New Komeito, is that a merger is certain to redraw electoral districts, creating uncertainty locally and in the Diet. Meanwhile, opinion polls are split, with some saying a slight majority of the public favors the merger and others showing most Osakans are uncertain how the plan will affect their lives. Hashimoto, in other words, heads into autumn faced with the monumental task of convincing voters, and the opposition, to agree to his plan even as he makes attempts to return to the national stage.",

Deputies, state troopers, forest rangers and U.S. Border Patrol agents were part of the ongoing search for 7-year-old Delila Miller and 12-year-old Fannie Miller, St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells said. Officials issued special alertt for the two girls after they were abducted around 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in the rural town of Oswegatchie. The girls went to wait on a customer at the family’s roadside stand, officials said. A witness saw a passenger in a vehicle put something into the back seat, and when the vehicle drove off the children were gone, police said. Both girls were wearing dark blue dresses with blue aprons and black bonnets. Because the Amish tend to shun modern technology, police had no photographs of the girls, Wells said. The rural county is home to New York’s second-largest Amish population, which has grown by some 10,000 upstate over the past decade, drawn by productive land and property prices lower than in Pennsylvania. Wells said the local Amish community was helping law enforcement by getting the word out despite a culture that avoids modern conveniences. “You’d be surprised how quick word spreads,” Wells said. The sheriff said police are looking for a white four-door sedan a witness reported seeing at the farm stand when the girls disappeared.",

    "source": "‘People’s Pope’ takes to streets in Kia Soul, fascinates South Koreans <eos> SEOUL - Pope Francis’ choice of wheels during his five-day South Korean visit has surprised many in this painfully self-conscious country, where big shots rarely hit the streets in anything but expensive luxury cars. After his arrival Thursday, the pope left the airport in a compact black Kia that many South Koreans would consider too humble a conveyance for a globally powerful figure. In a live television broadcast, the pope climbed into the backseat of the boxy Kia Soul, rolled down the window and waved. Surrounded by a few bigger black sedans, the pope’s compact car headed toward Seoul. Francis’ frugality and humble demeanor have received wide coverage in South Korea, a fiercely competitive country that celebrates ostentatious displays of status and wealth. This national trait can be seen in booming industries such as private tutoring and plastic surgery. The images of the smiling pope in his little car struck a chord online, with many playing on the car’s name. One South Korean user tweeted: “The pope rode the Soul because he is full of soul.” For the man called “The People’s Pope” the choice makes sense. He has eschewed the bulletproof “popemobiles” that his predecessors used on foreign trips and urged priests around the world to travel in low-key cars. Inside the Vatican City, the pope prefers a blue Ford Focus, or when he’s out in St. Peter’s Square, a white open-topped vehicle that allows him to literally reach out and touch the masses. South Korean media widely reported that the pope requested the smallest South Korean car during his visit. The Soul is Kia’s second-smallest model and reportedly provides more leg room than other compact cars. Though not everyone loves the Soul’s funky design, it appeals to a niche of young, practical drivers. It has never, however, been a car of the rich and powerful. Already bubbling with excitement over the first papal visit in 25 years, South Koreans appeared fascinated by the humble papal car. “I feel honored that Pope Francis will not be in a bulletproof vehicle,” said Shon Cho-eun, a 22-year-old Christian student. “I hope he arrives safely and delivers good messages to us.”",

The 41-year-old teacher allegedly told his second-grade student on July 17, “Do you have (a purpose to) live? If not, then jump from the window,” sources familiar with the matter said Thursday. The teacher at the city-run Shirawaki Elementary School also reportedly physically abused the 8-year-old boy by grabbing his arm and pushing him. The boy hit his back against another pupil and fell to the floor, the sources said. The Hamamatsu board of education is considering punishment against the teacher, determining that an apology he offered to the boy and his parents isn’t enough, the sources said. The teacher reportedly told the board that he became angry with the boy because he didn’t follow instructions. Board member Yasuo Sasahara said the city is taking the matter seriously and is investigating the teacher’s past behavior as well. According to other sources, he once reportedly told a non-Japanese pupil to “go back to your country.”",

    "source": "Robin Williams fondly remembered by Japan's film industry <eos> It was an open secret among Japanese film distribution companies that Robin Williams, who died at his California home on Monday in an apparent suicide, was a “yobitai sutaa” (“a want-to-invite star”). Unlike other Hollywood celebrities, Williams was famed for two things: He never complained, and he was always appreciative. Add to this a deep and sincere love for Nintendo (Williams even named his daughter after Princess Zelda from Nintendo’s “The Legend of Zelda”) and what the distributors had was a Hollywood guest from heaven. “Honestly, he was the nicest guy, ever,” says Atsushi Hirayama, who looked after Williams when he came to Tokyo on a promotion tour for “Bicentennial Man” in 2000. At the time, Hirayama was working for a major film distribution and advertising company. He recalls that of all the A-list stars he encountered between the mid-1990s and 2004, when he left the industry, “Robin-san was the most gracious person you could ever hope to meet. He was totally different from everyone else. “He never put on airs or made impossible demands or anything like that. In the mornings when I picked him up at his hotel, he was always spruced up, ready to go and concerned about how I was feeling that day. A real gentleman,” he said. One legendary Robin Williams episode goes like this: On one of his promotion tours, he was driven around Tokyo for a week by the same chauffeur. At the end of his stay, he presented the man with a pair of Louis Vuitton leather driving gloves because he loved the fact that “all the drivers in Tokyo wear white gloves. I can’t imagine anyone in the U.S. doing such a thing. You people live in an amazing country!” The chauffeur was so moved by Williams’ gesture that he wept. Williams also went out of his way to delve into Japanese culture, particularly anime. In an interview he gave The Detroit News in 1996, Williams talked about how taken he was with Japanese animation, specifically “Akira” and “Ghost in the Shell.” He had already seen “Princess Mononoke” in Japan, and described it as a picture “almost Greek in sophistication,” though it would be another three years before it opened in the U.S. “Japanese culture can be very dark,” Williams said in a Tokyo press conference in 2000. “It’s the contrast between the darkness and the brightness and humor and precision that I see so much of, that’s what makes it thrilling for me to be here.”",

    "source": "Kagoshima volcano erupts, warplanes fly over Tokyo, exhibit shows Okamoto's bold side, Emperor dies <eos> 100 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Jan. 13, 1914 People flee as volcano erupts near Kagoshima A terrible eruption on Sakurajima, an island in Kagoshima Bay having an active volcano, occurred yesterday at 10 a.m. Up to that time, since the night of the 10th, more than 70 earthquakes had been experienced in Kagoshima. With thundering sounds, the eruption was visible from all sides of Kagoshima. Columns of dark smoke cover the sky over the island. It would seem the people in the island are flying to the seashore for their lives. The latest report from the Home Ministry says that telegraphic communications between Kagoshima and Sakurajima have been cut off as the result of the eruption, and nothing can be known of the conditions in the volcanic isle. The eruption of Sakurajima on Jan. 12, 1914, caused 58 deaths and the destruction of more than 2,000 houses. 75 YEARS AGO Friday, Jan. 6, 1939 Warplanes to fly in formation over Tokyo More than 400 airplanes of the Imperial Army and Naval air forces will fly over the capital Friday morning and afternoon in spectacular formation. The epochal undertaking, it is stated, was planned by the authorities in order to respond to the earnest support rendered by the people on the so-called “home front” as well as to demonstrate the activities of the military air forces. According to an announcement by the Information Bureau of the War Ministry Wednesday afternoon, approximately 240 craft of the Army air force will gather over the Telegraphic Corps in Nakano in a great formation at 11:15 a.m. After appearing over Yasukuni Shrine, Kudan, via the Akabane and Fukagawa aerodromes, the participating machines are expected to circle over the city for about half an hour. 50 YEARS AGO Wednesday, Jan. 22, 1964 Exhibition shows Taro Okamoto in full force Open and direct expression of idea and personality is still a rarity in Oriental art. Still rarer are exuberance and humor in any art that aspires to “seriousness” and monumentality. The fact that Taro Okamoto’s art contains the qualities of exuberance and bold expression is not to be attributed to his decade of studies in Paris, for many other Japanese artists have returned from France without such liberation. His character is more likely derived from his parents, from a father who was a renowned cartoonist and a mother who was a poet. If Taro does not fit the Japanese pattern, neither does he conform to any precise category or styles. His Parisian studies took place in the 1930s, in the decade of fashionable surrealism. Everything Taro says is emphatically delivered. There is much to anger him in this troubled, confused, stupid, irrational, belligerent yet cowardly world. He senses the surrounding chaos with an artist’s sensibility and the soapbox orator’s vehemence. The years immediately after the war aroused his greatest indignation. The very titles of his paintings are embattled — as in “Man Atomized,” “The Disfigured One” and “Law of the Jungle” — or else sardonic, as in “Sunrise” (over chaos) and “Blue Sky” (with only a smidgen of blue in evidence). The long-awaited peace had brought new terrors, keener competition, aggravated hates, more powerful modes of destruction, and against these threats Taro finds only hypocrisy, shilly-shallying, cowardice. He strides forth to combat these devils, singlehandedly if need be. His tools are strident color, dynamic rhythms, violent oppositions, sharp contrasts, complex entanglements and diagonal crossings. Taro Okamoto is thus a “rara avis” among Japanese decorative artists. He has something to say and insists on being heard. Taro Okamoto’s giant mural “The Myth of Tomorrow” (1969), an imagination of the moment the atomic bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is installed at Tokyo’s Shibuya Station. 25 YEARS AGO Sunday, Jan. 8, 1989 Emperor dies of cancer at 87; Heisei Era begins The Emperor — who personified Japan during its conquest of its Asian neighbors and its surrender to the Allied powers, during war-inflicted devastation and the dramatic postwar economic recovery — died of cancer Saturday at the age of 87. His death, at 6:33 a.m. in Fukiage Palace of the Imperial Palace, ended the Showa Era. The 55-year-old Crown Prince immediately succeeded to the Chrysanthemum Throne in accordance with the Constitution and the Imperial House Law. The late Emperor reigned just over 62 years after acceding to the throne Dec. 25, 1926. He reigned far longer than his grandfather, Emperor Meiji, whose reign of 45 years and seven months had previously been the longest in Japan’s history. At an extraordinary Cabinet meeting later Saturday, the government chose “Heisei” as the new era name. It takes effect today. In announcing the name, Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi explained that it was taken from the Chinese classics and meant “achievement of peace both at home and abroad in heaven and earth.” The Emperor’s death was announced by the Imperial Household Agency at 7:55 a.m. Shoichi Fujimori, grand steward of the agency, made the first official announcement of cancer as the cause of death. He told reporters the late Emperor had been suffering from glandular cancer of the duodenum, with complications including inflammation of the bile duct, obstructive jaundice and uremia. Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita issued a statement of mourning. The statement expressed the hope that with the new Emperor’s ascension to the throne, the bonds that bind the Imperial Family and the people will become even stronger and good will towards other nations deeper.",

    "source": "Expiry dates <eos> Dear Alice, My teenage daughter recently turned into a food-label tyrant, apparently convinced that her doddering old parents aren’t up to the job of maintaining a safe kitchen. She patrols our refrigerator daily, fiercely checking every label. If the date on a package has passed, she tosses it in the trash. We’ve had fights about this. I’ve explained that manufacturers set those dates conservatively, so food is still safe to eat for a while past expiry. She insists we’ll die if it’s even one day over. So, what’s the truth? What the heck do those dates really mean? Sam T., Kumamoto Dear Sam, It’s hard when our children decide we’re past our prime, but old dogs can learn new tricks. Let’s prove we’ve still got a little shelf life by sorting out an admittedly tricky subject. First of all, there are two distinct types of dates used on food packages in Japan: shōhi kigen (消費期限) and shōmi kigen (賞味期限), which mean different things and are used on different foods. The two look confusingly similar in roman letters but are a little easier to distinguish when written in Japanese. For reference, both are visible in the photograph accompanying today’s column. I started my research at the Consumer Affairs Agency in Tokyo, where officials were sympathetic about your troubles. “Date labeling is confusing for Japanese consumers, too,” one assured me. “Many people don’t understand the difference between sh ō hi kigen and sh ō mi kigen, and they don’t know how to use the information.” That’s partially because the system is relatively new. Until 1995, companies were required to label foods with the date of manufacture. But consumers had no way of knowing how long after manufacture a product was safe to consume, and a lot of perfectly good product was returned or discarded. The current labeling was adopted to address that problem and to bring Japan’s labeling into line with international standards. Now, as part of an effort to reduce shokuhin rosu (food loss), various government agencies are making a renewed effort to help consumers use date-labeling correctly. Let’s do our part by learning the terms, starting with “sh ō hi kigen,” which you can see on the rice ball in the left side of the photo. It’s the four characters in front of the date. It means “limit for consumption” and is equivalent to the “use by” wording on food labels in English. “Sh ō hi kigen” is used for highly perishable products, including bento box meals, sandwiches and cakes made with fresh whipped cream A sh ō hi kigen should be taken seriously, because any product that warrants this labeling goes bad quickly after its “use by” date. The government states it this way: “ Kigen ga sugitara, tabenai hōga yoi .” (“If the date has passed, it’s better not to eat it.”) Adjusting for the less forceful way of expressing things in Japanese, they’re telling you to pitch it. Now look at the four characters on the snack package on the right in the photo. They read “ shōmi kigen ,” which corresponds to “best by” and “best consumed by” in English. The government defines “sh ō mi kigen” as, “ Oishiku taberu koto ga dekiru kigen” (“The limit for best taste”) adding, “ Kono kigen o sugitemo sugu taberarenai toiu koto wa arimasen .” (“That doesn’t mean the product can no longer be eaten as soon as the date has passed.”) This labeling is used on products with a long shelf life, including potato chips, instant noodles and canned food. Here, the date is more a reference to quality than safety. You might find the flavor off in out-of-date product, and the nutritional value may not be what it once was, but you’re unlikely to come to any harm if you consume it. But be aware that there are also moderately perishable foods, including milk, eggs, ham and tofu, that are labeled with sh ō mi kigen (“best by”) rather than sh ō hi kigen (“use by”). All these products are safe to eat for some days after the date on the package. It’s difficult to say exactly how long, but fortunately it’s pretty obvious when one of these foods goes bad. The government advises you to rely on your senses, checking for off colors and smells, and even taking a little into your mouth to make sure it’s right. You are absolutely correct that manufacturers set their “best by/use by” dates conservatively. In fact, government guidelines tell them to do so. The industry term for this is “ anzen keisū ,” which is expressed as “factor of safety” in English. The guidelines don’t specify what factor of safety should be used, but most food manufacturers in Japan use a 0.8 or 0.7 factor of safety. Here’s how that works, using an example I found on an industry website. If, for example, testing on a product shows that bacterial levels are within safe limits even five days after the date of manufacture, a company may use a 0.8 factor of safety (five days × 0.8 = four days) to set the sh ō hi kigen at four days. Throwing out good food is not only hard on your pocketbook, it’s also bad for the environment and a shame when so many people in the world are hungry. And given that Japan depends on imports for 60 percent of its food, it could be dangerous in times of crisis. Nevertheless, every year Japan produces more than 18 million tons of food waste, much of which is believed to still be edible. Some of this waste originates in industry practices, but an estimated half comes from households who buy more than they need and throw out food that is still safe to eat. So, is this enough information to convince your daughter to relax her guard? I do hope she’ll work with you to strike a balance between safety and the wise use of food. And maybe she won’t put you out to pasture just yet.",

    "source": "Cooperation vs. competition in space <eos> Shadows of winter clouds Run over the ocean Just before sunset It’s a pretty haiku, but it becomes quite extraordinary when you learn that it was written aboard the International Space Station (ISS) by astronaut Koichi Wakata, who tweeted it to his 50,000 followers on Jan. 9. That’s the same Wakata, of course, who spoke with his companion Kirobo on the ISS in December last year in what was the first human-robot interaction in space. In 2000, Saitama-born Wakata — whose Twitter alias is @Astro_Wakata — flew on the 100th mission of NASA’s Space Shuttle, and was the first Japanese to help build the ISS. Perhaps less notably, he revealed on returning from a monthlong Shuttle mission in 2009, he wore the same underpants the entire time. To be fair, they were a high-tech pair designed for long-term use. Right now, the extraterrestrial celebrity is nearly halfway through a six-month stay at the ISS as its first Japanese commanding officer. No doubt he welcomed the U.S. announcement last week that it intends to extend the life of the ISS until 2024. It’s an expensive commitment — costing NASA $3 billion a year — and the Americans are hoping other countries will pitch in. Science and Technology Minister Hakubun Shimomura said Japan — which, with the European Space Agency and Canada, is a major supporter of ISS funding — should positively consider the U.S. proposal. If the life of the ISS is not extended past its current end date of 2020, then in six years time it will be “de-orbited” and allowed to crash into the South Pacific. By most measures, the Americans don’t want that to happen. Quite apart from the scientific and engineering work conducted on the ISS, there is national pride. Or, put another way: If the U.S. winds down the ISS, the Chinese will take control of space. Some U.S. politicians view this as a national-security issue. That was one reason the U.S. blocked China’s initial approaches to join the ISS project: It feared it would improve China’s ability to develop space weapons. Tokyo may also prefer to continue supporting the U.S. effort in order to stop China making the running. But it’s only a matter of time — and Beijing is arguably already making the running. Last month it landed a rover on the moon — the first such “soft” landing there for 40 years. And the Chinese want to establish a space station by 2020. All astronauts speak in similar ways about how it made them feel to look down on Earth from space. They talk of a new and profound understanding of the fragile beauty of our planet, and of the need for different nations and religions to work together for the greater good. Canadian Chris Hadfield, who also commanded the ISS and has spent 166 days off-planet, said being in space “helps you recognize the unanimity of our existence.” Grimy politics usually gets in the way of such ideals. In 2011, the U.S. Congress passed a law prohibiting NASA from, among other things, hosting Chinese astronauts and scientists at its facilities. But there are signs that relations are thawing. On Jan. 11, Xu Dazhe, the new boss of China’s national space agency, said he wants to encourage international cooperation in space. And a few days earlier, at an International Space Exploration Forum at the U.S. State Department, Deputy Secretary of State William Burns expressed hope that the countries could work together. “The question is whether we can muster the courage and political will to advance space exploration and ensure cooperation continues to trump competition,” he said. As a strong Chinese presence off-planet looks certain, it makes sense to cooperate — and for inspiration we need look no further than at Ants in Space, an experiment that has just been delivered to the ISS by a rocket, Cygnus, operated by private company Orbital Sciences. It aims to research how ants — which in nature have no master plan or commanding officer — cooperate to explore new territories and work together to forage and build a nest. Entomologist Deborah Gordon of Stanford University in California has designed an experiment involving a capsule of worker ants delivered by the Cygnus craft that school students worldwide can take part in. The ants will be allowed to forage in special arenas on the ISS and schoolkids will be able to see how they operate in micro- gravity and test theories about the deceptively simple rules ants use to work together. Sounds like a promising metaphor for space cooperation among nations. Just beware one thing: The ant species being used is the Pavement ant (Tetramorium caespitum) , a nasty and invasive pest.",

    "source": "In Jomon and Heian, the times weren't a-changin' <eos> “Man the change-maker.” That is one definition of Homo sapiens. Other creatures are changed — by Nature, by evolution — over vast expanses of time measured in hundreds of thousands or millions of years. Humankind consciously generates change. We innovate, build, invent, destroy, build again. Even our earliest civilizations, ploddingly slow by present standards, far outpaced Nature as agents of change. Modern change, of course, knows no bounds; there’s never been anything like it. Last week’s science fiction is yesterday’s reality and today’s artifact. We’ve conquered space, conquered time — very soon, say some futurists (Raymond Kurzweil, most famously), we’ll conquer death, translating our mortal “selves” into immortal algorithms living on into cybereternity. To some this is exhilarating; to others, harrowing. Even the most progressive among us must at times long for a little rest, a brief pause, a quiet interval of contemplation: Where are we going? To what purpose? Are we headed in the right direction? Japan today is as frenetic as any other advanced society, but its past is long, and long stretches of it were surprisingly — astonishingly — changeless. Time stood almost still. Hundreds, thousands of years went by without life altering its course sufficiently to startle an imaginary observer who, having known the beginning, returned to see the end. Two periods in particular come to mind: the Jomon and Heian. They are not usually thought of together. The Jomon Period began roughly 12,000 years ago and lasted until about 300 B.C., making it one of the most enduring cultures in world prehistory. The Heian Period (794-1185) is an eye-blink in comparison, but by civilized standards long enough — and yet 794 and 1185 seem, culturally, economically and technologically, more similar than different. Nothing in 1185 would have left anyone in 794 speechless. What can neolithic hunter-gatherers, locked in a brutal and often losing struggle for mere survival in a harsh and untamed world, have in common with the dandified aristocrats of the urban, literate, musical, indolent, elegant, hyper-refined Heian Period? A few things. Changelessness, for one. We can’t penetrate the Jomon mind as we can, to some extent, the Heian. Jomon people left us no writing, as Heian people did, in profusion — “The Tale of Genji” most notably. “Genji” is a long (1,000-page-plus) novel, arguably the world’s first, by a sometime court lady called Murasaki Shikibu (born circa 975, death date unknown). Her prime concern was with the thoughts and feelings (mostly feelings) of her characters, some 430 of them. We get to know them and their small, narrow world very intimately. Of how many ancient societies can we say the same? They had everything, those Heian grandees — wealth, leisure, love, art, exquisite sensitivity, all the material satisfactions — and yet they were not happy. The dominant mood was melancholy. Their overdeveloped sensitivity was the problem. It showed them beauty’s beauty — but also its poignancy. Beauty blooms but also fades. The cherry blossom was Heian’s symbol par excellence — so beautiful and yet so fleeting! That visible truth reinforced their one overriding philosophical concept, derived originally from Buddhism — that the world was illusory. It was smoke; it was a wisp of cloud; you clung to it in vain. Better let it go — “leave” it if you can, not by suicide but by taking holy orders and becoming a monk or a nun, absorbed in prayers and visions of the next world, hopefully a more “real” world than this one. If this world is not real, why, or how, strive to change it? Not once does even a single character in the vast and populous “Genji” reflect on the possibility that human energy and creativity can change the world for the better. The Heian people were not change-makers. They were, ideally, world-transcenders. How different in that respect from us! We too have everything and are not happy — but we will be happy, so we seem to believe, if we can only produce just a little more of everything … and then a little more still. Heian Japan knew no corresponding hope. Jomon folk were artistic too. They produced not literature but pottery and sculpture — wildly primitive, shockingly beautiful ceramic sculpture, much of it representing pregnant women. The earliest figurines, called dog? , are some 12,000 years old, and thousands of years passed from then before experts can point to changes in style and technique. A nonexpert might sum up one change thus: For the first several thousand years, what seems most expressive in the dogū are not their faces but their bellies, source of life and sole defense against rampant, ever-present death. The odds of a newborn surviving infancy were surely very low and maybe, some archaeologists hypothesize, the dog? were a form of prayer on behalf of fertility and life. Conditions eased little by little across the millennia, accounting perhaps for an apparent shift in emphasis from belly to facial features. Though inconceivably harsh by civilized standards, the Jomon environment was not unkind as prehistory went. Archaeologists have discovered some 600 types of Jomon food, including a “bread” made from bean skins. Most neolithic cultures graduated from hunting and gathering to agriculture. Jomon didn’t. Why not? Evidently starvation, though widespread, was never urgent enough to demand or stimulate radical improvement. Contentment with the status quo — or perhaps an instinctive certainty that the status quo is all there is and all that is possible — infuses both the cultures of the Jomon and Heian. Their inertia baffles and disconcerts us, whose insatiable craving for change, for more, for better, hurtles us forward into an unknown future. Would they have envied us? Do we, in some secret corner of our 21st-century hearts, at odd moments in our busy, harassed, restless days, envy them?",

    "source": "Ishin's Osaka wing hopes Tamogami loses in Tokyo <eos> To the frustration — and rising panic — of nuclear village chieftain and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Tokyo’s gubernatorial election next month is shaping up to be a contest not about “local” issues like the 2020 Tokyo Olympics or even perennial complaints such as the lack of economic reform. Barring some last-minute change or surprise, it’s now a contest about the future of nuclear power in Tokyo and Japan. But in Osaka, the real question is what effect the entry of an old far-right-wing nationalist known for his inflammatory comments — who has the support of an old, far-right-wing nationalist also known for making inflammatory comments — will have on the political fortunes of Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto and Nippon Ishin no Kai (Japan Restoration Party). In one corner of the campaign, we have former health minister Yoichi Masuzoe, considered a moderate but, in reality, a conservative who, prior to March 11, 2011, argued for nuclear power. Since then (surprise, surprise) he has kept rather quiet. In another corner sits former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. He’s backed by former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Both oppose nuclear power, and Hosokawa is under attack by Abe and the most entrenched members of the nuclear village, particularly economic and fiscal policy minister Akira Amari. Among older Osakans, Hosokawa is known less for his stance on nuclear power and more because he hails from Kumamoto Prefecture, where, as governor, he learned firsthand how impoverished Japanese politics and society had become in a Tokyo-centric nation — a message that resonates well in Osaka and Kansai. Meanwhile, Masuzoe appeals to younger Osakans who are less-focused on a rivalry with Tokyo and more interested in a TV-friendly candidate with a slight populist bent who seems like a rich, successful version of themselves. However, it’s a third candidate who is getting the most attention in Osaka’s political world, especially because his entrance may further drive a wedge between the Tokyo and Osaka factions of Nippon Ishin: Toshio Tamogami. The former chief of staff of the Air Self-Defense Force, fired in 2008 for defending Japan’s wartime aggression, advocates a nuclear-armed Japan against China and all of the usual political and social agendas favored by ultranationalists and right-wingers. Needless to say, Tamogami’s biggest political supporter is Nippon Ishin co-leader and former Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara. Earlier this month, Ishihara hinted he would support Tamogami’s bid, but only personally. Hashimoto and most in Nippon Ishin’s Osaka faction have no use for Tamogami. Younger Osaka party members derisively refer to Ishihara and the elderly Tokyo nationalists as “old garbage,” and Hashimoto is not pleased with Ishihara’s latest move. He and the Osaka faction wanted the party to back someone more in tune with Nippon Ishin’s local economic and bureaucratic reform agenda, but couldn’t find anyone. Thus, the party will not officially endorse a candidate. However, ideology aside, the move by the Osaka faction is good politics. With the Olympics coming, the same Tokyoites who didn’t much care when Ishihara, as their governor, made racist comments and provoked the United States, China and South Korea by trying to purchase the Senkakus are suddenly all nervous smiles, anxious to forget the past and move on by electing a governor who will not embarrass them internationally over the next four years. Hashimoto, and the Osaka faction, know Abe and the central government feel the same way. Even if many around Hashimoto share Tamogami’s views privately, they recognize that, politically, the smart move now is to keep quiet and not upset the ruling party. Ishihara and his allies can be dealt with once Tokyo voters chose either Hosokawa or Masuzoe.",

While 210,000 children under age 10 accounted for almost a third of the 660,000 flu cases reported in the week of Jan. 13 to 19, another 200,000 patients were made up of people in their 30s and 40s, according to data released by the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry. Following are questions and answers on how to prevent the flu and what measures to take if you do come down with it: How does influenza differ from a normal cold? A cold is generally triggered by different kinds of viruses, and involves such symptoms as sore throat, nasal discharge and coughing, but normally these aren’t severe, and a fever, if present, isn’t so high. Influenza is caused by the influenza virus and normally comes with a fever of over 38 degrees and the sudden appearance of systemic symptoms such as a headache and joint and muscle pain. People who develop any of these symptoms should consult a doctor as soon as possible, as the flu can sometimes cause complications such as acute encephalopathy in children and pneumonia in the elderly or those with low immunity to diseases. Does the flu vaccine prevent infection? The vaccine reduces the chances of getting sick after infection. It can also reduce the severity of symptoms when a person does come down with the flu. As the vaccine doesn’t take effect for about two weeks after inoculation, the best time to get a shot is around mid-December. What measures can be taken to prevent infection? Lately, products have come on the market billed as having “a chlorine dioxide generator” with the ability to kill viruses and bacteria. The products include room dispensers, devices you wear around your neck and sprays for face masks. More orthodox measures are washing hands after going out, sanitizing hands using an alcohol formula, spending as much time as possible in adequate humidity (50 to 60 percent) and avoiding crowded places. What should you do if you’re diagnosed with influenza? Take adequate medication prescribed by a doctor, get plenty of rest — sleep is especially important — and try to take lots of liquids.",

    "source": "Number of influenza patients rising rapidly <eos> With the influenza season approaching its peak this winter, the number of patients reached about 660,000 nationwide in the week of Jan. 13 to 19, almost doubling the 340,000 tallied the previous week. The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry issued a warning last week that the outbreak has reached epidemic proportions and that the peak won’t be reached until early February. The health ministry said Okinawa Prefecture, followed by Miyazaki, Gifu, Oita and Fukuoka, are the hardest-hit areas. Close to 700 schools for all age groups were closed from Jan. 13 through 19, and the number is expected to rise. Although the epidemic has spread mainly in western Japan, it was also expanding in the Kanto region, including Tokyo and Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama prefectures. Large numbers of cases appeared in early December in Saitama and then spread to Tokyo, Kanagawa and Chiba in the week of Dec. 16 and expanded through the third week of January, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Infectious Disease Surveillance Center. “The epidemic is bound to spread even further in the next few weeks,” said Yoshiyuki Sugishita of the center. Although the flu peak varies from year to year, it usually occurs between late January and early February. The health ministry said that during last winter, the number of patients increased from 800,000 in the week of Jan. 7 to 13 to 1.4 million the following week and then to 2.14 million in the week of Jan. 21 to 27. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases said that almost 50 percent of the cases were due to Hong Kong A-type virus, followed by H1N1 swine flu, accounting for about 30 percent. Sugishita said the reason for the resurgence in swine flu, which became a worldwide epidemic in 2009, has not yet been discovered. “Influenza is expected to approach its peak in the next week or two, so countermeasures such as not getting close to anyone who has the flu, washing your hands thoroughly and wearing a mask become necessary,” he said.",

For the talks, the 600,000-member Japanese Electrical, Electronic & Information Union, or Denki Rengo, said Tuesday it will demand a monthly pay-scale hike for the first time since 2009 of ¥4,000 or more for engineers. The 63,000-member Toyota Motor Worker’s Union is expected to decide Feb. 6 on a bonus demand equivalent to 6.8 months of wages, up ¥300,000 from the previous year, along with an average ¥4,000 hike in the pay scale. The electric industry union, comprising workers of mainly electric machinery makers, is a key member of the nation’s largest labor union federation, the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo). It has decided to demand a hike in the minimum monthly wage by ¥3,000 to ¥158,000 for an 18-year-old worker in the industry. “A basic pay hike is necessary for these (spring) talks. Otherwise, it won’t contribute to a virtuous cycle in the Japanese economy,” said Shoji Arino, leader of the industry union. Last year it demanded only the maintenance of the pay scale, under which individual workers get seniority-based raises without an increase in total labor costs for the industry.",

    "source": "Shift to isle defense requires upgrade of all three branches <eos> The Cold War ended about 20 years ago and Japan is finally trying to execute a drastic transformation of the Ground Self-Defense Force by shifting its focus from the north to the southwest — effectively relaxing its guard against Russia and bolstering it against China. Facing China’s growing military power, the new 10-year national defense guidelines the Cabinet endorsed in December spell out plans to bolster the defense of islands to the southwest, most notably Okinawa and the disputed Senkaku chain in the East China Sea. The GSDF will procure 17 MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and 52 amphibious vehicles and create new units dedicated to defending “remote islands” like the Senkakus, which are controlled by Japan but claimed by China and Taiwan. The GSDF plans to remove all of its tanks from Honshu and leave only about 300 on Hokkaido and Kyushu. The Defense Ministry will meanwhile procure 99 faster, more maneuverable combat vehicles that will be capable of reaching speeds of 100 kph and can be airlifted to remote islands. Experts are skeptical about the need for amphibious units to defend the Senkakus, arguing the GSDF might be just trying to secure budget allocations at a time when the debt-ridden government has little room to increase the defense budget further. Without air and maritime superiority, an amphibious unit would have little chance of prevailing in a battle over a remote island. Thus the Maritime Self-Defense Force and Air Self-Defense Force need to be reinforced before amphibious units are introduced, said Shunji Taoka, a noted military journalist and former senior writer for the major daily Asahi Shimbun. “If you maintain air and maritime superiority, no (enemy) force could approach (a remote island). If you lose it, you cannot send an amphibious unit there. “So it is air and maritime superiority that matters. You don’t need a landing force” to defend the Senkakus, Taoka maintained. Toshiyuki Shikata, a professor of Teikyo University and former commanding general of the GSDF’s Northern Area Army, agreed that the most important element in defending an island is air superiority, and then to win control of the seas. “Given that (improving) the MSDF and ASDF is the priority now, the GSDF is in a difficult situation” when it comes to budget allocations, Shikata said. But he stressed that the creation of an amphibious unit that includes Ospreys will greatly enhance the GSDF’s capabilities and be useful if a remote Japanese island needs to be recaptured, like one of the Senkakus. The Osprey flies twice as fast as the aging CH-47 helicopters long used to transport GSDF troops. Shikata estimates that an Osprey could carry SDF troops from a camp on Okinawa Island to the Senkakus in an hour, whereas it would take some 10 hours if they went by ship. “The great thing about (Osprey) is its speed,” said Noboru Yamaguchi, a former lieutenant general of the GSDF who is now a professor at the National Defense Academy of Japan. Ospreys have a range of around 600 km and can be refueled in flight. The islands of Okinawa could even be defended by MV-22s based in Honshu, Yamaguchi said. He emphasized it is urgent for the operations of the ASDF, MSDF and GSDF to be integrated in order to defend remote islands. As it is, joint operations for the three branches are key elements of the new national defense guidelines, which call for bolstering the network data linkage among the ASDF, MSDF and GSDF. The Defense Ministry plans to purchase six U.S.-made AAV-7 amphibious assault vehicles to study their performance before making a final decision on which equipment to procure.",

    "source": "Tokyo, Washington agree to stay course on sealing TPP <eos> DAVOS, SWITZERLAND - Japan and the United States have agreed to continue to work closely on speedily concluding the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade talks, trade minister Toshimitsu Motegi said after meeting Saturday with the U.S. trade chief on the fringes of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Motegi, the Economy, Trade and Industry minister, said he urged Washington to show more flexibility in his meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman. Froman called on both sides to do so, Motegi said. The 12 TPP countries bordering the Pacific Ocean have been struggling to seal a pact at an early date after missing a much-touted 2013 deadline for an agreement at their last ministerial meeting in December in Singapore. Tokyo and Washington have been at odds over how to deal with tariffs that Japan seeks to retain on five “sacred” farm product categories. The U.S.-led TPP aims in principle to abolish all tariffs. Farm minister Yoshimasa Hayashi also met separately with Froman and said they discussed tariffs on the five sensitive categories, which are rice, wheat, beef and pork, dairy products and sugar. He declined to elaborate. The U.S. government, which hopes an outcome can be reached before midterm elections in November, is proposing convening the next 12-country ministerial meeting in late February, but it has yet to be confirmed. TPP nations initially sought to hold such a meeting in January, but decided to delay it because there was little chance of overcoming the huge gaps over such issues as tariffs, intellectual property rights as well as reform of state-owned firms. In a separate meeting of trade ministers, meanwhile, chiefs of the world’s biggest economies pledged to broaden a deal to boost global trade, with the U.S. saying nothing is off-limits. At a Swiss-hosted meeting on the sidelines of the WEF, ministers from China, the European Union, Japan, the U.S. and 15 other nations agreed to build on the “positive momentum” of a World Trade Organization summit last December in Bali where its 159 member economies agreed to cut customs red tape. Motegi said Saturday’s discussion focused on “how to go forward with the WTO” while also implementing the red tape-cutting provisions previously agreed to in Bali. Japan, he said, has shown “a considerable amount of flexibility” during the talks and hopes the U.S. will be similarly flexible. The ministers agreed to address the most difficult remaining negotiating topics of agriculture, market access and services that eluded an agreement last month in the first WTO deal since the global trade body was formed in 1995, said Swiss Economics Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann, who hosted the meeting. BOJ’s Kuroda cautious Jiji Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda expressed cautious optimism on the global economy at a discussion in Davos, Switzerland, on Saturday. The U.S. economy is “likely to grow by 3 percent this year and next year,” and the European economy is “finally recovering and growing,” Kuroda said. Japan is also making “significant progress” and can get out of deflation, he noted. “We have to be always mindful of” downside risks, Kuroda said, but added, “I think we can be cautiously optimistic about the global economic outlook.” “There is still a long way to go” before the central bank reaches its 2 percent inflation target, the BOJ chief said.",

    "source": "No plan best plan in Kansai nuclear disaster <eos> Ten months after regional governments were required to submit nuclear disaster evacuation plans, a lack of central government guidance and local-level cooperation is generating concern that Kansai will be ill-prepared to respond if any of Fukui Prefecture’s 13 commercial reactors suffers a meltdown. Questions remain about how fleeing Fukui residents who pass through neighboring Kyoto would be stopped and screened for radiation, and how residents in the rural northern areas closest to the reactors would be gathered and evacuated in a timely manner. Evacuating the elderly, young mothers and the pregnant is also a serious concern. There is also the question of what to do if Shiga’s Lake Biwa, which supplies drinking water to about 14.5 million people, gets contaminated with radiation. Citizens’ groups have posed these and other detailed questions to prefectural officials in Kyoto and the Union of Kansai Governments, a loose federation of seven prefectures and four major cities in the region. But Kansai officials reply that, on many issues, there is little they can do because the central government hasn’t drafted specific guidelines. For example, while Tokyo will order residents within 30 km of a nuclear plant to evacuate in a crisis, winds could stretch a radioactive plume well beyond that range. Detailed plans based on wind projections during a radiation leak continue to be discussed, but there is little in the way of concrete proposals. It is also unclear how evacuations would be carried out if a storm, blizzard or other natural disaster on the Sea of Japan coastline of Fukui or Kyoto ends up closing access roads within 30 km of a power plant. Local disaster response plans have yet to spell out how people in northern Kyoto, which is rural and lacks the wide thoroughfares of the capital, can be effectively evacuated. “Kansai authorities have admitted that many towns and cities are not ready to receive evacuees. Authorities admit that the evacuation of pregnant women, young children and others who need care should be a priority, but no such plans are in place,” said anti-nuclear activist Aileen Mioko Smith of Kyoto-based Green Action, following meetings with Kyoto and Kansai officials late last year. Under a Union of Kansai Governments agreement, Hyogo Prefecture is in charge of coordinating disaster response policy for the union’s seven prefectural members, although Fukui is not one of them. Last year, Hyogo officials carried out a simulation of what would happen just to Hyogo if a Fukushima-like event were to occur at one of the four reactor sites in Fukui. They concluded that the town of Sasayama (population 43,832) would be exposed to a maximum of 167 milliseiverts over a seven-day period, three times an international level that triggers the use of iodine tablets. Guidelines established by the Nuclear Regulation Authority call for iodine tablets to be distributed to those within 5 km of a nuclear plant. While there are discussions about extending the radius to 30 km, no final decision has been made. “I don’t think that stockpiling and dispensing iodine tablets is particularly difficult compared with, say, stockpiling Tamiflu for avian flu. Plans need to be revised quickly,” Hyogo Gov. Toshizo Ido said when the results were announced. Under the Hyogo simulation, parts of Kyoto Prefecture would be in even greater danger — a point Smith and other Kyoto citizens have made to local officials. In Kyoto, there are now specific emergency drills based on what would happen in a nuclear disaster. The most recent exercise was conducted on Jan. 17, the 19th anniversary of the Kobe earthquake. The small drill involved about 20 prefectural and Self-Defense Forces officials responding to reports of radiation in the air following an earthquake and tsunami. The drill assumed that critical information from the national SPEEDI network, which assesses radiation levels in real time, would be conveyed to them quickly. There are seven SPEEDI monitoring spots within 10 km of the power plants in Fukui that collect data on Fukui and Kyoto prefectures, and another six within 30 km, including one in Shiga. Kansai leaders recognize that more monitoring stations, particularly in northern Kyoto and Hyogo, are needed, but without guidance from the central government, as well as funding, there is little they can do. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government has made restarting the nation’s nuclear reactors a primary goal. The discussions have focused mostly on the technical issues related to the plants and whether the fault lines surrounding them, or in some cases under them, are active. Given the widespread concerns, Smith says such thinking puts the cart before the horse. “It’s a very serious problem that Japanese nuclear power regulation does not require evacuation plan approval as a prerequisite for restarting nuclear power plants,” she said.",

    "source": "Jury still out on Kansai union's worth <eos> OSAKA - A useless talk shop that will ultimately be remembered as a massive waste of taxpayer money, or a farsighted experiment that will someday be seen as the forerunner of a fundamentally new system of central government? That’s the question that supporters and critics of the Union of Kansai Governments are asking three years after seven Kansai prefectures and four major cities banded together to increase cooperation in everything from disaster planning to tourism promotion and standardized testing and licensing. Due to geography, Kansai’s main cities of Osaka, Kyoto, Nara and Kobe are no more than an hour apart by limited express trains. It’s possible to travel to all four in under 2½ hours, which is less than the time it takes to travel by shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka. But familiarity often breeds contempt. Kansai’s local governments have a long history of not cooperating with each other, resulting in rival plans to attract businesses and tourists. They’ve also been plagued by traditionally limited communication or mountains of bureaucratic red tape when it came to things like dispatching emergency vehicles and personnel across prefectural borders. Over the past three years, progress has been made toward removing some of the barriers. The governors and mayors meet on a regular basis and draw up plans in areas they specifically agree to coordinate for the entire union. Hyogo, having suffered the 1995 Kobe earthquake, is in charge of coordinating disaster relief measures. Kyoto is in charge of tourism promotion for the region, while Osaka is in charge of economic development. Their most visible success to date has been agreeing to get the entire region to cut back on electricity usage in 2011 after the nuclear power plants were shut down, resulting in expeditious, coordinated action that prevented rolling blackouts during the peak summer months. But while demonstrating some ability to react to outside events, the union has been poor at being proactive, partially because of the limited local powers under the prefectural government system. Advocates of the union point out that it’s too early to issue a final report card on how useful it is, and that its ultimate goal is to replace the Meiji Era prefectural system with a series of semi-autonomous regional blocs and a weak central government. Needless to say, that idea is met with open hostility in Tokyo, which fears it would lose power and prestige. Critics come in two types. The first consists of those who see the union as a good idea being poorly executed because of central government regulations, entrenched local bureaucratic rivalries and differing attitudes among the political members about the wisdom of drawing too closely together. The second group, even as they agree with the first group about the problems, sees the union as fundamentally anti-democratic, a creation of Kansai’s corporate lobby that is more interested in taking away local rights to, for example, block construction of an airport, dam or power plant. The union is not about smaller government, they say, but about creating a Kansai fiefdom that would be run as a giant corporation where efficiency trumps local democracy. To what extent the union’s political leaders will be willing to spend political capital to enact ideas has always been the question. As efforts to formulate a detailed, unionwide disaster response plan in the event of not only an earthquake and tsunami, but also a nuclear disaster demonstrate, however, local politicians and bureaucrats are hard-wired to deal with the problems in front of them, not those on the horizon, however imperative it may be to address them before they become disasters.",

    "source": "Japan, Russia discuss territorial issue <eos> The deputy foreign ministers of Japan and Russia met Friday in Tokyo to resume talks for settling the long-standing territorial dispute over the Russian-held islands off Hokkaido. Deputy Foreign Minister Shinsuke Sugiyama is representing Japan while the Russian delegation is led by Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov. Similar talks were held last August in Moscow. Since the summit last April between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Vladimir Putin, Tokyo and Moscow have moved closer, with the two countries reinforcing common interests in areas such as energy and security. Several summits and talks between top officials have followed. Tokyo hopes to grab the momentum to break the territorial stalemate and conclude a peace treaty with Russia. Japan has said that if Russia acknowledges the four islands as belonging to Japan, Tokyo is prepared to respond flexibly to the timing and manner of their actual return. But Russia has shown no signs of recognizing Japanese sovereignty. After day-long talks at the Foreign Ministry’s Iikura guesthouse, Sugiyama said the two had practical and meaningful discussions on the deadlocked territorial dispute. “We discussed (the territorial dispute) from historical, legal and many different aspects. We’ve spent the whole afternoon on this matter, talking to the extent that I’ve become bit exhausted,” Sugiyama told reporters after the eight-hour meeting, of which five hours were dedicated to the territorial issue. “We had talks last August (in Moscow), but this was the first for me to have such earnest discussions using hours covering various issues (on the territorial dispute),” Sugiyama said. But holding such meaningful discussions just one time is not enough to resolve the long-standing issue, he said, adding that Tokyo and Moscow will arrange to schedule the next negotiations. Along with the territorial dispute, the two discussed economic cooperation and cultural exchanges as well as the situation in North Korea, the Middle East and Central Asia, he said. The meeting precedes talks Saturday between Foreign Ministers Fumio Kishida and Sergey Lavrov in Germany, Abe’s attendance at the Feb. 7 opening ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics and an expected visit to Japan by Putin this year. The dispute over the islands, called the Northern Territories in Japan and the Southern Kurils in Russia, has prevented Tokyo and Moscow from concluding a peace treaty for World War II. The four islands — Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai islet group — were seized by Soviet forces in the closing days of World War II after Japan’s surrender on Aug. 15, 1945. Abe and Putin agreed in their April meeting in Moscow to resume the sovereignty negotiations. Since then, the two leaders have held four meetings and are expected to hold another one in February when Abe visits Sochi. “Although there still remains a wide gap between the positions of Japan and Russia concerning the issue of the Northern Territories, the main pending issue, Japan will persistently engage in negotiations in order to resolve the issue of the attribution of the four islands and conclude a peace treaty with Russia,” Kishida said Jan. 24 in an address on the first day of the current Diet session.

The planned deal will help Tokyo-based Lixil achieve its target of increasing sales from emerging markets to more than 30 percent of its revenue, from about 20 percent now, Chief Executive Officer Yoshiaki Fujimori said in an interview Monday. The company could spend tens of billions of yen on its next takeover, Fujimori added. Since Fujimori joined the company in June 2011, Lixil has spent $5.3 billion buying companies in the U.S. and Europe to counter slowing demand at home amid the shrinking population. It is now seeking acquisitions that can help increase revenue from Southeast Asia, South America and Africa, he said. “2014 will be the year for Lixil to start full-fledged efforts to globalize itself with the brands we have created and gained through acquisitions,” said Fujimori, who formerly worked for General Electric Co. “We’ll seek a two-digit percentage growth in revenue by expanding sales from emerging markets.” Fujimori declined to identify any targets, saying only that a deal would be “water-related.” Besides bathroom fixtures, Lixil also manufactures building materials for housing as well as doors and windows. To keep pace with its global shift, Lixil plans to reshape management for some of its departments, including human resources, marketing and business development, Fujimori said. The company will hire an American lawyer fluent in Japanese, Chinese and English to head its legal department starting in April, he said, without identifying the person. In September, Lixil and Development Bank of Japan agreed to acquire an 87.5 percent stake in Germany’s Grohe, a maker of high-end faucets and other bathroom fixtures, for €2.94 billion ($4 billion). The deal is expected to close by June 30. It earlier bought the maker of American Standard toilets for $542 million and has also purchased Permasteelisa SpA, which made walls for the Guggenheim Museum and Sydney Opera House. Lixil’s revenue for the year that ended in March 2013 rose 11 percent to ¥1.44 trillion, while net income jumped more than elevenfold to ¥21.3 billion. It forecasts profit of ¥41 billion for this business year, on revenue of ¥1.6 trillion, Lixil said in its Nov. 5 earnings statement. Fujimori said he almost pulled out of early negotiations to buy Grohe after disagreeing on price and will always keep the option of walking away from an acquisition. “You don’t put yourself in a position that you must make a deal no matter what,” he said.",

Yuan Zai’s debut had long been anticipated on this island of 23 million people. With delighted visitors passing in front of her cage at the rate of 40 per minute, Yuan Zai showed off her climbing skills before retreating to mother Yuan Yuan’s embrace, and then heading off for a nap. She currently sleeps 20 hours a day. Zoo officials say they will be able to accommodate 19,000 visitors a day to see Yuan Zai, whose mother and father came to Taiwan from China in late 2008. Their arrival was seen at the time as a high water mark in Beijing’s use of “soft power” in Taiwan, which split from the mainland amid civil war in 1949, and remains the object of unwavering Chinese attempts to bring it back into the fold — by persuasion if possible, by force if necessary. But politics seemed to be about the last thing on the minds of Yuan Zai’s fan base Monday as again and again visitors’ faces lit up with broad smiles amid giggles of glee and repeated cries of “how cute” or “how beautiful.” Chinese giant pandas have been a hit all around the world, but they seem to have a special cachet in Taiwan, where animal figures are so much in vogue that Taiwanese airline company Eva Airways has found that festooning its aircraft in the livery of fictional Japanese character Hello Kitty provides a powerful boost to sales.",

The labor union, however, opposes the plan. The move by the labor side could make it difficult for the company to carry out the personnel cuts. Renesas aims to achieve an operating margin of 10 percent in fiscal 2016. It cut about 3,000 employees last fall after the third round of calls for early retirement, but it has been forced to consider additional restructuring measures as it fell short of its goal. The semiconductor maker has been rebuilding its management after seeing its business deteriorate due to the strong yen in the past and intensifying competition from overseas rivals. During the three calls for early retirement since its launch in 2010 through the merger of Renesas Technology Corp. and NEC Corp.’s semiconductor unit, more than 11,000 workers left the company. After announcing the closure of some production bases, Renesas received ¥150 billion in investment from the government-backed Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and eight Japanese companies, including Toyota Motor Corp., last September. Renesas intends to further slash its fixed costs to improve profits as its profit plan does not see sales increasing, the sources said. As for the envisioned personnel cut, the company plans to introduce a new program to encourage employees to transfer to other companies in addition to soliciting early retirements, the sources said. PCs tumble in Asia Singapore AFP-JIJI Sales of personal computers fell 10 percent in the Asia-Pacific region last year due to sluggish economic growth and tough competition from mobile devices, an industry analyst said.

Sea Shepherd, best known for its anti-whaling activities, said that of roughly 250 captured dolphins, the fishermen first selected 52 to keep alive for sale to aquariums and other customers. They included a rare albino calf and its mother. Of the rest, about 40 were killed, one became stuck in a net and drowned, and the others were released, it said. A video released Tuesday ( apne.ws/1hIC1xm ) by Sea Shepherd shows dozens of fishermen on boats surveying the dolphins after they were confined to a cove with nets. Divers can be seen holding the dolphins selected for sale and guiding them to nets hanging off the boats. While other dolphins have been killed since the hunting season began in September, Sea Shepherd said the 250 herded into the cove last Friday was the largest group it has seen since it began monitoring the hunt. The annual hunt in the village of Taiji received high-profile criticism when U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy tweeted last weekend that she was deeply concerned about the practice. The fishermen say the hunt is part of their tradition and call foreign critics who eat other kinds of meat hypocritical. A government spokesman defended the annual dolphin hunt on Monday, saying it is carried out in accordance with the law. The hunt was the subject of the Academy Award-winning 2009 film “The Cove.”",

Many thanks to the friend for some highly toe-curling and blood-curdling entertainment. Much effort must have gone into achieving that overall effect. Gripping as the performance was, the temptation to hide behind the couch for sheer embarrassment was rather great. Apart from the entertainment value, there were a number of points that I felt compelled to comment on regarding the content of Abe’s speech. Three to be precise. For one, the gent doth protest too much, methinks. I have discovered that Wikipedia has some interesting things on this point. Let me quote them verbatim: ” ‘The lady doth protest too much, methinks” is a quotation from the 1602 play Hamlet by William Shakespeare. It has been used as a figure of speech, in various phrasings, to indicate that a person’s overly frequent or vehement attempts to convince others of something have ironically helped to convince others that the opposite is true, by making the person look insincere and defensive.” To my mind, the above sounds like the live commentary on that Davos speech of Abe’s. There was much protestation concerning the robustness of the Japanese economy, of the new industries that were about to spring to life, of the vibrancy that defies the concept of twilight. All this is great stuff insofar as rallying cries go. But are they true? More to the point, why so much emphasis on health and well being? Such excess protestation tends to sow seeds of doubt. Does he know something we don’t? Are things so bad that he has to go to this extent to protest against reality? Is he in denial? And so forth. Of course, it could well be that he believes he can walk on water anyway. In which case woe betide those who are on board when his ship starts sinking after all. The second issue is one of positioning. Abe was supposedly given the honor of delivering a keynote speech for the Davos gathering. Putting aside for the moment the issue of what on earth these meetings are for in the first place, keynote speeches are surely not about posturing. Nor are they about parading one’s perceived achievements. Keynote speeches, as I understand them, should set the tone for the questions that need to be addressed in the discussions that are about to take place. Such speeches ought to inspire. They should get people thinking. They should stimulate minds. They should give rise to discourse of a high intellectual caliber. High octane was much in evidence in the Abe speech, but to what keynote end was not at all evident. The third issue is one of semantics. The prime minister and his cohorts seem eager to make the phrase “ganban kisei” catch on. “Ganban” is a thick slab of rock. “Kisei” is regulation. Japanese newspapers reported that the prime minister made much of this phrase in his Davos speech. What the prime minister actually said in English was that he will go ahead and destroy all “rock solid vested interests.” “Rock solid” is entirely acceptable as a translation for ganban. But what about vested interests? Are all rules and regulations actually vested interests? Should all regulations be the target of ax-grinding and drill-wielding because they are by definition borne out of vested interests? Are there no regulations anywhere that are deemed legitimate because they protect the right kind of interests? In this day and age of “black” companies that exploit their staff, it could well be that we need more, not less, regulation. Of the right kind.

The preliminary tally represents a more than sevenfold increase from 230 cases during the same period a year earlier, and compares with 352 cases the previous week. The agency said casualties spiked Saturday and Sunday, when temperatures topped 35 degrees in some parts of the country. Of those taken to the hospital by ambulance, 425 people required hospitalization and 41 required stays of three weeks or more. More than 40 percent of those hospitalized were 65 or older. The heat showed no signs of easing Tuesday as the town of Bihoro in Hokkaido recorded an all-time high of 37.2 degrees by early afternoon. It was the fourth consecutive day in which temperatures in Japan topped 35. The Meteorological Agency issued a heat alert for most of Hokkaido and for nearby Akita Prefecture, and urged the public to take precautions against heatstroke. The agency reported the start of the rainy season in the Shikoku region in western Japan, two days earlier than normal. The rainy season usually ends in Shikoku around July 18",

    "source": "When a physical wasteland bred a moral wasteland <eos> He lived by fire and he died by fire. He was vile — coldblooded, amoral, ruthless. He was the man his time called for, and the man his time called forth — a vile time, by most standards. Its name is Sengoku Jidai, a period of prolonged civil war. Oda Nobunaga (1534-82) is its most representative character — a military genius and a moral monster. He was a visionary, a shaper of the future, to which, if necessary — and it was — he would sacrifice the present. Or was he simply power-mad? The central government, long impotent, had collapsed altogether, leaving Japan a confused welter of domains ruled by ungovernable warlords — some 260 of them as of 1467. The Onin War that began that year dragged on for a decade, reducing Kyoto, the ancient capital, to a smoldering ruin. The Zen poet Ikkyu (1394-1481) wrote: “One burst of flame and the capital — gilt palaces and how many mansions — turns before one’s eyes into wasteland.” Physical wasteland breeds moral wasteland — a morality of the sword. “As the cherry among blossoms, so the warrior among men,” goes an old saying. No saint, the warrior. “The path of the soldier is a deceitful one,” wrote the Confucian scholar Kaibara Ekiken (1630-1714). Bored with the peace of his own time, Ekiken looked back with nostalgia on Nobunaga’s era, perhaps on Nobunaga himself. “Depending on the circumstances of the moment,” he wrote, “one might trick or betray one’s allies, usurp the spoils won by others or throw the land into turmoil and seize it from those above: As a matter of military tactics, there is nothing wrong with this. It is the way of warfare in Japan.” The end of the Onin War brought not peace but fighting under different names, or under no names, for causes that defy attempts to make them sound noble. Or, perhaps not. For beneath the sordid land hunger and lust for power, amid the carnage, the disdain for life, the shifting alliances and betrayals and breakdown of even a semblance of moral decency as anyone now living understands the term, an idea was taking shape, vague at first, clearer as time passed. Nobunaga, with what mixture of idealism and cynicism it is impossible to know, was among the first to articulate it. His motto, tenka fubu (“the realm, ruled by might”) meant, in effect, national unification, under a ruler strong enough to quell chaos and impose order on fierce local lords. He was the man and his the might, he thought. So it might have proved, had he lived. He was born in 1534, son of a minor samurai in a minor province, Owari, roughly today’s Aichi Prefecture. His father’s death in 1551 left the family headship in dispute, and the first act by which we know Nobunaga is his murder, by a foul stratagem, of a younger brother asserting rival claims. The second is more significant — stunning, in fact. With 3,000 soldiers he crushed an army of 25,000 — probably the largest army in Japan at the time — led by a neighboring lord en route to Kyoto to press his own version of something like tenka fubu. If you’ve never heard of the Imagawa clan, it’s because Nobunaga effectively wiped it out — otherwise you might have. He was suddenly much sought after as an ally. Alliances were customarily sealed with marriages. Nobunaga’s younger sister, Oichi, symbol to later times of the samurai woman quietly enduring the unendurable, around 1565 was given in marriage to a son of the Asai clan. In 1570, the Asai broke with Nobunaga and joined his enemy, the Asakura clan. Didn’t they know who they were dealing with? Defeated, a surviving Asai-Asakura remnant sought refuge in the Enryakuji, one of thousands of Buddhist temples on Mount Hiei overlooking Kyoto. Buddhist monks then were not what they are now. They were armed and dangerous. Here was Nobunaga’s chance. His soldiers set fire to the surrounding dry fields. Thousands burned to death. “Everything, everywhere,” says a contemporary chronicle, “from the central cathedral to the 21 shrines of the Mountain King, the bell tower and the library, were burned to the ground.” Buddhism in Japan never recovered its dominating influence. Oichi was permitted to return to her brother’s castle with her three daughters. Her infant son, however, was put to death. By 1582, Nobunaga was master of Kyoto and of one-third of Japan. The nation’s future seemed his to mold. A resentful retainer turned on him, setting fire to the Kyoto temple in which he was hosting a tea party. Nobunaga’s body was never found. The future was his anyway — or was it? It was, in that within 30 years of his death tenka fubu was no dream but reality, Japan firmly united under the rule of Nobunaga’s ally, Tokugawa Ieyasu, first of a long line of Tokugawa shoguns stretching all the way ahead to 1867. In another sense, Nobunaga was less successful. Not he but his treacherous assassin was the hero of 18th-century kabuki re-enactments. In one play, his killer declaims, “Heedless of remonstrance, Nobunaga destroyed shrines and temples, daily piling up atrocity upon atrocity. It was my calling to slay him for the sake of the warrior’s way, for the sake of the realm” Never mind that in the Sengoku Jidai there was no “realm” — and not much of a “warrior’s way” either, unless it was the “way” articulated by Ekiken, or by a warlord named Uesugi Kenshin (1530-78), a Nobunaga rival and a Zen man who succinctly summed up both Zen and his times: “Those who cling to life die. Those who defy death live.”",

    "source": "U.S. professors urge universities to sever ties with China's Confucius Institutes <eos> BUFFALO, NEW YORK - University professors in the United States have joined their Canadian counterparts in urging universities to cut ties with Confucius Institutes unless the agreements that bring them to campus are reworked to guarantee academic freedom. A report by the American Association of University Professors said universities “have sacrificed the integrity of the university and its academic staff” by allowing the Chinese government to supervise curriculum and staff at the institutes it has established on more than 100 North American campuses to promote Chinese culture and language. “Allowing any third-party control of academic matters is inconsistent with principles of academic freedom, shared governance, and the institutional autonomy of colleges and universities,” the report by the association’s Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure said. The Canadian Association of University Teachers raised the same issues in December following an instructor’s human rights complaint alleging discrimination based on her belief in Falun Gong, a spiritual group that has been banned in China. The complaint led McMaster University in Ontario to close its Confucius Institute last year after the complaint was settled through mediation. The Beijing headquarters for the Confucius Institutes, the Office of Chinese Language Council International, known as Hanban, did not respond to requests for comment. However, the Communist Party’s flagship newspaper, People’s Daily, ran an article Friday seeking to refute the AAUP report’s claims, quoting representatives from foreign institutions from Germany to Thailand who called them unfounded. When reached, directors at several Confucius Institutes in the U.S. also defended the institutes, saying the AAUP doesn’t understand how they work. “The university comes first, and then the Confucius Institute, which must operate within the rules of the university,” said Xu Zaocheng, director of the institute at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. “It is true that it is a program under the Chinese Ministry of Education, but the accusations reflect the Cold War mentality,” Xu said. The Chinese “fund these activities, but they are not controlling them,” said Stephen Dunnett, chairman of the binational committee that oversees the University at Buffalo’s 5-year-old institute. “If they came here and said we will give you this money but we’re going to control it: We’re going to pick the curriculum, we’re going to pick the teachers by ourselves, and we’re going to teach or not teach what we want. . . . What U.S. university would ever do that?” he said.",

    "source": "Doctor admits trying to murder dialysis patient 'on impulse' <eos> A doctor has admitted trying to kill a dialysis patient by removing a tube and causing the man to bleed out, police said Friday. Internist Kenjiro Hashizume of Machida, western Tokyo, told investigators he went to his clinic and picked a victim at random after suddenly getting an urge to kill someone, officers at Machida Police Station said. Hashizume, 49, was arrested Thursday for allegedly removing a tube that controlled the blood flow of a patient undergoing dialysis the previous day. He appeared before the Tokyo Public Prosecutor’s Office on Friday. A specialist in internal medicine, Hashizume is director of the Akebono No. 2 Clinic, which specializes in kidney conditions. Police quoted him saying he felt a sudden urge to kill when calling at a convenience store on his way home from work at 7 p.m. Wednesday. He returned to the clinic at around 8:20 p.m. The 50-year-old victim realized he had been disconnected from the dialyzer when he saw blood spurting from a tube, police said. Hashizume then drove to Machida Police Station and turned himself in. The victim is described as being in a stable condition. Police suspect the physician may be mentally ill. Hashizume said he has been telling his family about problems at work and other worries for years, adding that he tried to kill himself a few days before the incident, the police said. “I tried to commit suicide but I failed,” they quoted him as saying. “I wanted to kill someone, then get caught by police and be put to death.” They added Hashizume reported having trouble sleeping and concentrating at work for about six months. During questioning, the police said Hashizume told them he picked the victim “because he happened to be near the entrance” of the dialysis room. About 10 patients were undergoing treatment at the time and were under the care of clinic staff on shift at that time.Toshiaki Nango, director of the Sanyukai group, which runs Akebono No. 2, apologized for what happened. The company also runs two other clinics and Akebono Hospital in Machida. A similar event at the same clinic resulted in the death of a woman in June 2010, investigators said. The patient died of severe bleeding after a tube was disconnected. Hashizume was the doctor who confirmed the woman’s death, but investigators concluded that one of the nurses, not Hashizume, was responsible and filed a case with prosecutors on charges of professional negligence resulting in death. Patients and neighbors expressed shock at the arrest of a man they had considered mild-mannered. “He looked really gentle and didn’t seem to be capable of doing such a horrible thing,” said a man in his 70s living near the clinic. Fujiko Kinoshita, 72, a Machida resident received dialysis treatment under Hashizume’s care, gave a similar impression. “He was very polite and always kind when he responded to my questions,” Kinoshita said.",

    "source": "The hormone behind man's best friend <eos> The other day I saw a picture of a dead dog on Twitter. Gross, right? Not at all, for this wasn’t just any old dog: This was Hachiko, perhaps the most famous dog in the world, and certainly the most famous in Japan. The tweet announced that it was the last photo ever taken of Hachiko. He is shown lying on a pallet, surrounded by the staff of Shibuya Station and his owner’s wife. It is 1935, and every day for the last 11 years Hachiko has been turning up at Shibuya Station to meet his master, a University of Tokyo professor called Hidesaburo Ueno. But unbeknownst to the dog, the professor died in 1925, so for 10 of those years Hachiko has waited in vain. Even when he was alive, Hachiko was a famous dog. People would come to see him, pat him and give him treats. But when he died (of cancer, not from a yakitori skewer as some legends have it), the fame just got bigger. A year before his death, a statue was erected outside the station in his honor. It’s obvious why he is so famous. It’s a touching story. People like to feel the sad warmth that comes from contemplating a story of death, loyalty and love. When I searched Twitter to find the photo I’d seen, I found lots of mentions of Hachiko, lots of stories about him and lots of retweets of “the last photo.” Dog lovers are a fierce tribe, and it may be reckless to even ask why dogs are so loyal, or seem coldly scientific to investigate the underlying cause. But getting on for 100 years since Professor Ueno’s death, fellow University of Tokyo scientists are doing just that. Teresa Romero, Miho Nagasawa and colleagues — all current or one-time dog owners — are looking at how the hormone oxytocin is involved in the way dogs form bonds with humans and other dogs. If Hachiko is the world’s most famous dog, oxytocin may be the most famous hormone. (Though adrenalin would put up a good fight.) Often introduced as “the cuddle chemical,” “the love hormone” or even “the moral molecule,” it is known to be involved in the formation of the bond between mother and child (the contractions of the uterus stimulate its production). It is behind the monogamous pairing of prairie voles, and it can also make people more trusting. Most research on oxytocin has been on monogamous animals, and in humans in a reproductive context. Romero and Nagasawa wanted to explore its possible role in other types of social relationships. Being dog people, they naturally wondered about dogs — canine relations with humans and with other dogs. How do dogs — which are pack animals, remember — form social bonds with their group members? “Oxytocin was an excellent candidate, since previous research has shown that it plays an important role in parental bonding and mating in both humans and other animals,” says Romero. And if oxytocin is involved, it makes sense to investigate its role in the relationship dogs form with humans. The team recruited 16 dogs. (It would be nice for my story if one of the subjects was an Akita dog, the same breed as Hachiko, but no: nine standard poodles, four Labrador retrievers, one German shepherd, one Shetland sheep dog and one border collie.) The animals were given oxytocin in a nasal spray, and their behavior was recorded for the next half hour. The team found that compared with dogs given only a saline nasal spray, the oxytocin-dosed dogs showed more positive social behavior toward other dogs and humans. They approached them more, looked toward them more and initiated social contact more. “Oxytocin plays an important role in how dogs form and maintain friendly relationships with both their owners and dog partners,” says Romero. The team conclude that oxytocin might be the way enduring cooperative bonds evolved. Dogs or other animals don’t need to understand that it will be in their genetic best interest to cooperate with each other, or even with other species — oxytocin does it for them. Dog people will often assert that their dogs have moods, and even that dogs are capable of love. Sometimes it’s hard to deny the idea. I read about a dog with a lifelong hatred of water, but which jumped into a lake to drag a fallen child to safety. But oxytocin can explain bonding without invoking love. Since the hormone enhances the feeling of reward that the animal receives, a dog automatically learns to associated the good feeling it gets from positive interactions with another dog or with a human. A positive feedback loop means that if it repeats something that has given it a rewarding feeling — such as waiting for its master at the train station for the pat on the head it receives — it will continue to perform that behavior. Or as Romero puts it: “Our results provide new insight into the mechanisms that facilitate the maintenance of close social bonds and complement a growing body of evidence that identifies oxytocin as one of the neurochemical foundations of sociality in mammals.” Her work is published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (DOI reference: 10.1073/pnas.1322868111). It makes me wonder about Hachiko. Why did he wait so long? Was he stuck in a hopeless feedback loop, waiting every day for a reward that never came? “It’s unknown if differences in the type and distribution of oxytocin receptors in dogs modulate their behavior,” says Romero. Surely in normal cases the loop wears out — dogs stop waiting, people stop loving. If you never stop loving and you never stop waiting, is something wrong? Actually, I think that’s something that no experiments on oxytocin will ever answer.",

    "source": "Is 'rational' Toru Hashimoto acting irrationally? <eos> Just how little influential political or intellectual opposition in Japan is there to fundamentally conservative politics and economic theories touting the wisdom of the corporate mentality? Well consider this: Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka and co-founder of Nippon Ishin no Kai (Japan Restoration Party), may soon start to look like a rational moderate. Yet that’s the Alice in Wonderland world we’re in, following Nippon Ishin’s split between Hashimoto and 37 of his mostly Osaka, mostly younger followers, and Shintaro Ishihara and the 23 mostly Old Men of Tokyo (at least at the top), who are by and large conservative or ultraright-wing in their views and supported by the more extreme elements of Japan’s electorate. After the split, “rational” was the word Hashimoto used several times to describe the character of his Osaka supporters. They are, he suggested, men and women more interested in practical issues than in refighting World War II or nursing a grudge over the U.S.-led Occupation. When it comes to China and South Korea, there’s something of an attitude in the Hashimoto camp of “business is business and politics are politics,” and the two can, and should be, separated (although they erred badly in assuming their Asian “friends” would feel the same way about Hashimoto’s “comfort women” remarks last year). As a politician, Hashimoto has visited China and South Korea (but hasn’t yet set foot in the continental U.S.) and was impressed by the energy — and comparative youthfulness — of local government and business leaders, how “rational” they appeared, and how Osaka needed some of their “pragmatic” leadership. Of course, the rationale behind Hashimoto’s use of the word rational is political and ideological. His economic advisers tend to admire the political-economic policies of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. The mostly older male corporate leaders and academics were studious young men during the 1980s, when such theories were in vogue. They learned their lessons well, even if most have learned little since. But the new version of Hashimoto and Nippon Ishin is drawing interest both inside and outside of Osaka. The Democratic Party of Japan’s Seiji Maehara, the darling of U.S.-Japan think tank experts and a China hawk, appears interested in a political alliance with Hashimoto. Maehara, from neighboring Kyoto, enjoys the support of many businesses there involved in renewable energy, a key Hashimoto goal. Since Hashimoto’s Nippon Ishin already plans to merge with Yui no To, which will add 14 members, an agreement with Maehara and his roughly 20 followers to merge or cooperate in the Diet would turn it into a powerful opposition party. If, as some in Osaka predict, the DPJ’s Goshi Hosono and his 15 followers also decide to tie up with Hashimoto, the Osaka mayor would again be one of Japan’s most influential politicians. However, the break with Ishihara and the political chattering about how many Diet allies Hashimoto will wind up with obscures a vital fact: Locally, he and his Osaka-based group Osaka Ishin no Kai (One Osaka) are in deep trouble. The plan to administratively merge the city of Osaka with the prefecture is all but dead due to opposition in both assemblies from New Komeito and the LDP. Osaka Ishin’s members are now nervously eyeing their prospects in the local elections scheduled for spring 2015, wondering if they’ll be voted out of office. So while many in Osaka are happy that Hashimoto ditched Ishihara and continue to back him during his attempt to recast himself as a rational opposition leader in the Diet, a growing number in Osaka are wondering if Hashimoto’s claim of rationality isn’t — politically at least — irrational. View from Osaka is a monthly column that examines the latest news from a Kansai perspective.",

But at this year’s G2E in the 3,000-room Venetian Macao resort, which boasts a shopping arcade mimicking the canals of Venice and acres of casino space large enough to host thousands of attendees from over 70 countries, it was Japan, the one major Asian country without casinos, that was on the minds of many attendees. “There are a couple of things that are different this time about the movement in Japan to legalize gaming through integrated resorts compared to past discussions. First, there is now political stability with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Second, there’s a renewed emphasis on the economy with ‘Abenomics,’ and this type of economic project fits in with those macroeconomic policies,” said Ed Bowers, senior vice president of global gaming development at MGM Resorts International, which is interested in building a casino in Osaka. Gaming professionals noted that, unlike Tokyo, Osaka government officials have been very proactive in courting international resort operators and interest in the city is high. However, Bowers and Japanese gaming officials present in Macau, while optimistic, were also cautious. “It’s going to take time. The IR promotion bill now being considered in the Diet has to be passed, probably in the autumn session. Within a year after that, the government has to draw up the legal framework for casinos and then amend or create new legislation necessary to allow casinos,” said Takashi Kiso, CEO of the International Casino Institute, a Japanese think tank and lobby group. Nobody in Macau was placing bets on whether casino gambling would arrive in Japan before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. But there was a general feeling that, when Japan does open its first integrated resort with a casino in Osaka or elsewhere, it will likely be a hybrid of the casino models found in Singapore and Macau. “The Singapore model restricts entry of locals, with controls such as entrance fees and third-party blacklisting (those on welfare or with bad financial records). At the Venetian in Macau, you have a casino right in the middle of the complex. But in Singapore, the casino had to be more hidden, and those wanting to go would have to find it themselves. There are also severe restrictions on advertising,” said Steve Park, managing director of KORE Co., a Seoul-based consulting firm to the international gaming industry. “The Macau model is freer but puts more responsibility on individuals to ensure they don’t end up in harm’s way. Singapore, though, is paternalistic,” Park said. “If you look at South Korea, a Confucian-based culture, or Japan, also very conservative, the paternalistic model of restrictions has to be to their nature. That’s probably why those countries’ officials like the Singapore model better than the Macau or Las Vegas model.”",

    "source": "Shark 'photo-bombs' competition for surfing mothers in Australia <eos> CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA - A jumping shark has “photo-bombed” a surfing competition off an Australian beach. Amateur photographer Steph Bellamy captured the image of the shark with her smartphone on Sunday as she was photographing mothers and their children paddling on their surfboards off a beach in the New South Wales state town of Coffs Harbour. Bellamy, 47, said Tuesday that she did not know that the splash in her viewfinder was a shark until she examined the image on her phone moments later. “He jumped twice, he photo-bombed big time, then he went on his way,” Bellamy said. “Photo-bombing” is a term for when someone jumps into the frame of a photo just before the shot is taken. The mothers, like Bellamy, had children in the Coffs Harbour Boardriders club and were taking part in a special mothers’ heat toward the end of day of a local surfing competition when the shark appeared a few meters away from the group. She photographed the second breach. Bellamy quickly showed the image to organizers, proving that the split-second disturbance had not been caused by a dolphin or tuna. The surfers were called out of the water. But about 15 minutes later, most returned and the completion continued, she said. “Nobody was rattled. Everybody was really cool and blown away that I got the shot,” Bellamy said. Colin Simpfendorfer, a James Cook University shark expert, confirmed that the image was of a shark. He said it was possibly a spinner shark, which is common in the region and is known to jump from the water. He estimated it was around 2 meters long. Lee Winkler, who was among the surfers near the shark, said he mistook it for a tuna. “It was having a bit of fun,” Winkler said. “It just jumped up and had a spin, then jumped up and had another spin, then went away.”",

    "source": "LDP campaign message diverges in urban, rural areas <eos> The Dec. 14 Lower House election is being billed as primarily a voter referendum on economic issues, especially “Abenomics.” But regardless of what the parties’ Tokyo headquarters say is official policy on various issues, it’s what the candidates and the local party chapters say, or don’t say, out on the campaign trail that wins or loses votes. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s national platform devotes one paragraph to the Trans-Pacific Partnership — that the party is pursuing the most favorable path for Japan’s interests based on previous LDP and Diet resolutions. But in those parts of the country where the free trade pact is a particularly sensitive issue, local LDP chapters have released their own interpretations. “We will not allow the abolishment of tariffs on important agricultural items, and that won’t stop us from withdrawing (from negotiations) if these sacred areas can’t be guaranteed. We’ll protect until the end the life and industry of the people of Hokkaido,” the LDP Hokkaido chapter campaign platform reads. In the Hokkaido No. 11 district, the LDP’s Yuko Nakagawa, 55, is seeking re-election in a district that includes the farm-heavy Obihiro and Tokaichi areas, where anti-TPP sentiment is among the strongest in Japan. She has repeatedly reminded voters of the prefectural chapter’s message, even though opinion about the TPP in Hokkaido as a whole is varied. “Eastern Hokkaido is generally more against TPP than western Hokkaido and the Sapporo area, which is more like Tokyo,” says Shoko Uchida, a Tokyo-based anti-TPP activist. “People just want cheap agricultural goods.” In early 2013, a Mainichi Shimbun survey of 480 Lower House members on their attitudes about participating in TPP negotiations revealed that 244 were opposed. The negotiations remain stalled, partially due to the inability of Tokyo and Washington to come to an agreement on agricultural products. Other issues high on voters’ minds are restarting the nation’s idled nuclear power plants to public concerns about collective self-defense and the new state secrets law. The national LDP’s platform is more detailed about nuclear power than it is on the TPP, calling it an important baseload energy source. It goes on to talk about the need to obtain local understanding for restarting reactors if they pass the new safety regulations. In Kagoshima Prefecture, where two reactors at the Sendai plant may be restarted early next year, the LDP’s prefectural chapter has similar language about the need to pass new safety standards. But it also says it will make the maximum effort to obtain the sufficient understanding of residents and local governments, which can be read as broader in scope than merely obtaining the permission of Satsumasendai, the city where the plant is located. The Sendai plant lies in the Kagoshima No. 3 district, where incumbent Takeshi Noma, who is running as an independent and is wary of the restarts. Noma is facing off against LDP and Komeito-backed Takuma Miyaji in a race that is expected to be close.",

In recent years, official manifests serve as TV talking points as pundits — be they boorish young comedians or serious, sober-minded, gray-haired fellows — debate at length each party’s stance on the economy, social welfare, constitutional revision, nuclear power, self-defense or the rural-urban divide. Invariably, reams of data are presented as insightful analysis, while no reporter wishes to be thought of as being irresponsible for depriving the citizenry of their right to know how many terms the candidate has previously won, or failing to show how they are all striving equally hard to win. But while the media focus on politicians and elected parties address the who, what, where and when of Japanese politics, it can fall short of providing a road map to understanding the “why.” That’s because, as any loyal Osakan will tell you, the country’s media tend to give the bureaucracy’s role in the political process something of a pass. One of the reasons Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto’s Ishin no To (Japan Innovation Party) is hated in Tokyo so much is that, among other things, it proposes some fundamental reforms that strike at the heart of the nation’s bureaucratic kingdom, and the cozy relations that exist between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito and the bureaucracy. It’s not just oft-heard demands such as cuts in civil-servant salaries that Ishin wants, but something much more frightening: accounting transparency. The Osaka lawyers and business consultant types who joined Hashimoto’s movement brought with them standards and practices from the corporate world that threatened the unwritten rules developed over decades of LDP cooperation with the bureaucrats. Osaka’s corporate world is hardly an international model of accountability. Yet, compared to the creative bookkeeping exercised by the central government and the Diet, it at least has a logic, and a clear goal — profit — that can be easily understood. However, because Ishin handled one of its key issues, the integration of Osaka city and prefecture, so poorly, running up against entrenched local political and bureaucratic opposition that it has yet to be overcome, it was no wonder that many Osaka voters cast their ballots for the LDP or Komeito in single-district seats, even as the party finished first in Osaka Prefecture for proportional seats. Of course, the former requires more votes to obtain than the latter. But the message out of Osaka seems to be that, while voters in certain districts personally preferred LDP Candidate A to Ishin Candidate B, the number of votes cast for Ishin’s proportional seats means many in Osaka have not given upon on the dreams of either Hashimoto or Ishin to achieve civil-service reform and, eventually, more autonomy for local government. This is because a lot of younger, ambitious Osaka voters don’t trust the LDP to do much more than maintain a good relationship with the bureaucrats — namely, maintain the status quo and not move forward with fundamental reform. Such an attitude could well be seen again in April, when voters go to the polls in local elections nationwide. Ishin does not have a majority in either the municipal or prefectural assemblies, and how the Lower House results will affect those campaigns is unclear. Of course, much of Ishin’s rhetoric about corrupt bureaucrats is just that, while what sounds like utopia to Hashimoto’s supporters sounds like dystopia to a lot of other people. But Hashimoto’s reform philosophy still resonates deeply in Osaka, even if voters went for the LDP this time due to Hashimoto’s personality and Ishin’s inability to translate rhetoric into reality.",

    "source": "Sea Shepherd protesters found in contempt of court for anti-whaling campaign <eos> SAN FRANCISCO - Radical environmentalists were found in contempt of court Friday for failing to heed an order to halt their relentless campaign to disrupt the annual whale hunt off the waters of Antarctica. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered a commissioner to determine how much Paul Watson and members of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society he founded owe Japanese whalers for lawyer fees, damage to their ships and for violating the court order to stop their dangerous protests. The Japanese whalers are demanding $2 million in addition to their lawyer fees and damage and cost to their ships for warding off the protests. Calls and emails to the Sea Shepherd U.S. office and its lawyer were not returned Friday. In 2012, the court ordered Sea Shepherd to stay at least 500 feet (150 meters) from Japanese whalers and to halt dangerous activities like attempting to ram the whaler and also throwing smoke bombs and bottles of acid at the Japanese ships. The crews of Sea Shepherd ships also drag metal-reinforced ropes in the water to damage propellers and rudders, launch flares with hooks and point high-powered lasers at the Japanese whalers to annoy crew members. The Sea Shepherd’s exploits have been documented on the long-running Animal Planet reality TV series “Whale Wars.” The Japanese whalers filed a lawsuit in Seattle in 2011 seeking a court order halting the Sea Shepherd’s campaign. The 9th Circuit in December 2012 ordered the Sea Shepherd’s to stop their dangerous harassment of the Japanese fleet and for the group’s four ships to stay at least 500 feet (150 meters) from the whalers. Watson then transferred all of Sea Shepherd’s U.S. assets to foreign entities controlled by the group. Sea Shepherd has organizations in Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Watson also stepped down from the board of directors of Sea Shepherd organizations in the United States and Australia. Sea Shepherd Australia took over management of “operation zero tolerance,” the group’s annual harassment campaign of the whalers in the Southern Ocean. Watson also resigned as captain of the Sea Shepherd’s flagship the “Steve Irwin,” but remained aboard as an “observer.” In February 2013, the 9th Circuit appointed a commissioner to investigate whether Watson or Sea Shepherd should be held in contempt of court. The commissioner concluded on Jan. 31 that the Sea Shepherds weren’t in violation of the court order because the harassment campaign was being managed outside the United States. That same month, the Sea Shepherd’s ship “Steve Irwin” with Watson aboard collided with a Japanese whaler. On Friday, a three-judge panel rejected the commissioner’s findings. The 9th Circuit ruled that the transfer of asset and control of the Sea Shepherd from the U.S. to Australia and other countries didn’t change its 2012 order to the group to cease its dangerous activities. Contrary to the commissioner’s conclusions, the 9th Circuit said that Watson and the Sea Shepherd’s U.S. affiliate could be found liable for aiding and abetting the organization’s foreign offices to violate the court’s injunction. “Sea Shepherd U.S. is liable because it intentionally furnished cash payments, and a vessel and equipment worth millions of dollars, to individuals and entities it knew would likely violate the injunction,” Judge Milan Smith wrote for the unanimous panel. The court ordered the case sent back to the commissioner to determine how much the whalers are owed.",

    "source": "State secrecy law takes effect amid protests, concerns over press freedom <eos> Japan’s controversial state secrets law came into effect Wednesday as hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets, saying the measure undermines the public’s right to know and demanding that it be scrapped. More than 300 protesters, including roughly 100 journalists, gathered in front of the prime minister’s office in Tokyo’s Chiyoda Ward, chanting slogans like “We oppose the secrecy law for going to war” and “Information belongs to citizens.” “We’ve seen more and more pressure on media organizations that are critical of the administration,” said Seigo Arasaki, who heads the Japan Federation of Newspaper Workers Unions, known as Shimbun Roren. “We will monitor how the law will be applied, and raise questions,.” Under the law that cleared the Diet in December 2013, the heads of 19 government ministries and agencies can now designate as state secrets information deemed to be sensitive in the areas of diplomacy, defense, counterterrorism and counterespionage. A recent Kyodo News survey covering the 19 government offices showed the number of state secrets will likely be around 460,000. Civil servants or others who leak the secrets will face up to 10 years in prison, and those who instigate leaks, including journalists, will be subject to a prison term of up to five years. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who established the National Security Council to speed up decision-making on diplomacy and defense, has said the law will help Japan to promote exchanges of sensitive information with other countries and forge closer ties with them. State secrets are defined in 55 categories, including information about the development of submarines, aircraft, weapons and ammunition. Intelligence and images obtained via radio waves and satellites and provided by foreign governments and international organizations could be withheld from the public. The initial five-year-designation period for a state secret can be extended for up to 30 years. But state secrets can be classified for a maximum 60 years if approved by the Cabinet for security reasons. The law takes effect just as Abe appears to be seeking greater influence over the nation’s media, according to Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo. The LDP sent a letter to Japan’s five biggest broadcasters last month to demand “neutral” reporting on the election. Abe told reporters on Dec. 1 he didn’t order the party to send the letter, though he hoped the election would be covered “fairly and impartially.” The Japanese Federation of Bar Associations said on its website the new act opens the door to the government arbitrarily designating secrets. “The definition of secret is very vague, and people, including myself, are wary of misuse,” said Kaori Hayashi, a professor at Tokyo University’s Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies. The Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association said in a Dec. 8 statement the maximum sentence for leaks was too harsh and could damage reporting activities and the public’s “right to know.” Criticism has also been directed at the absence of an independent watchdog, as oversight entities will be placed under government control. To ease such public concerns, the Cabinet approved guidelines on the handling of state secrets, pledging that it will keep “the minimum amount of information as secrets for the shortest period of time possible” as the public’s right to know should be “greatly respected” in a democratic society. “We will make sure that the people’s right to know will not be hurt,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Tuesday. It has been revealed, meanwhile, that the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office, which holds jurisdiction over the secrecy law, had warned government offices in 2011 that people who have studied or worked abroad have a higher risk of leaking state secrets. Under the secrecy law, security clearance is required for officials to handle state secrets, and the government will set up hotlines so officials can report suspicions about arbitrary classification or declassification of state secrets. The prime minister is also required to make an annual report to the Diet on the designation, safeguarding and disclosure of state secrets. After the passage of the secrecy bill last year, Japan fell six places to 59th out of 180 nations in Reporters Without Borders’ 2014 World Press Freedom Index, below such nations as Serbia and Botswana. “Investigative journalism, public interest and the confidentiality of journalists’ sources are all being sacrificed by legislators bent on ensuring that their country’s image is spared embarrassing revelations,” the group said.",

    "source": "Digital tack taken to revive interest in New Year's cards <eos> The tradition of sending “nengajo,” or New Year’s postcards, has been in decline as people turn to the Internet, social networking and digital gadgets like smartphones instead of putting pen to paper. Japan Post Co., the postal arm of government-owned Japan Post Holdings Co., is thus hoping to get younger generations interested in writing paper greeting cards this year by introducing a digital feature known as augmented reality, or AR. “Young people are using smartphones now, and we hope to attract them to the New Year’s greeting card tradition through those smartphones,” said Hiroyuki Sugita, senior manager at logistics and sales at Japan Post. “By connecting digital to tradition, we want them to discover the fun of sending New Year’s greeting cards,” he said. Numbers tell the story about the decline in nengajo. Japan Post’s issuance of New Year’s cards peaked in 2003 at 4.45 billion. The number has been falling every year since 2008, and only 3.3 billion have been issued this year. In a bid to revive interest in the New Year’s tradition, Japan Post this year is selling cards that offer virtual character content, including Hello Kitty and Japan Post’s Poskuma bear mascot, via augmented reality. Japan Post said all plain New Year’s greeting cards, which account for about 80 percent of the 3.3 billion copies, have an AR feature provided by Sony Corp. The AR feature is viewable via a special app downloaded on smartphones. The stamp locations on the cards have an embedded AR code that, when viewed through a smartphone, displays Poskuma mascot offering a greeting. Japan Post will update the special AR content on New Year’s Day so it features the pop idol group Nogizaka 48. Japan Post has produced various New Year’s greeting card designs over the years, but they never offered digital elements, Sugita said. “This time, we have blended (digital elements in the paper cards) with smartphone applications, so that customers can enjoy a different experience,” he said. Japan Post has also prepared 15 million copies of Hello Kitty-themed New Year’s cards with an AR feature provided by creator Sanrio Co. “We’ve surveyed people about (greeting card) characters and Hello Kitty is popular every year. Kitty is also popular with younger generations of women that we’d like to target for New Year’s cards,” said Shuichi Adachi, assistant manager of the postage stamp and postcard division. Naturally the AR content of the Hello Kitty cards boasts the feline character, which will appear on card recipients’ smartphone screens, clad in kimono and offering a greeting. People can also touch and move the AR Kitty around on the screen and adjust its size. Recipients can also take a picture with the AR Kitty and use it on return greeting cards. Adachi said just offering an AR feature that offers virtual content wouldn’t be very interesting, so Japan Post made it possible to take pictures with the character and use them to design New Year’s cards. Still, it is unclear how AR content will help motivate people to get back to the paper tradition, as many young people now use SNS services like Facebook , Twitter and Line to greet friends over the holidays. Japan Post offers Line nengajo services, too. While the Internet and smartphones have contributed to decline in nengajo writing, Sugita and Adachi also mentioned that Japanese people are generally becoming more sensitive about giving out their home addresses as they become increasingly aware of the need to protect personal information. This trend is also cooling people to the traditional New Year’s greeting cards, upon which they provide their address and personal notes, they said, in the belief that going digital is somehow safer. Also, “people can easily contact their friends with smartphones, so they don’t need to know their address,” Sugita said. Sugita noted that while young people nowadays rarely write and send New Year’s greeting cards, the tradition is also on decline among older generations.",

    "source": "Ishin-DPJ tieup, Kepco's greed to play key roles in April polls <eos> The Dec. 14 Lower House election was many things. But in terms of domestic politics, it was merely a prelude to something far more important: the nationwide local elections next April. Even as debate continues about whether the election weakened Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, strengthened coalition partner Komeito, showed Ishin no To (Japan Innovation Party) could still garner support, reinvigorated the Japanese Communist Party or sounded the death knell for extreme right-wing parties and politicians, all eyes have turned to April 12 and 26, 2015, when nearly 1,000 local governments, from prefectural assemblies to small villages, hold elections for governor, mayor and their legislative bodies. National-level politicians have had their eye on the April elections for a while now. Since September, Abe and his Liberal Democratic Party in particular have been talking up and promising assistance to different regions, at the sometimes nervous insistence of local LDP leaders worried that the party’s Diet members have paid insufficient attention to Japan outside of Tokyo and the bread-and-butter (or perhaps rice-and-miso soup) issues local voters expect politicians to address. For Kansai, Sunday’s Lower House election result and what it means for next April likely depends on three things. First, whether the unexpectedly strong showing of Ishin no To, co-headed by Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, will also benefit his local political group Osaka Ishin no Kai (One Osaka). Before the election, Ishin no To was widely predicted to lose as many as half of its 42 Lower House seats to LDP or Democratic Party of Japan candidates. But voters returned 41 Ishin members to the Diet. Osaka Ishin members hold pluralities in the Osaka Municipal and Prefectural assemblies. Hashimoto, and Osaka Ishin, have staked their entire existence on being able to merge the city and prefecture. However, opposition from all of the other parties, including Hashimoto’s nominal local partner Komeito, has prevented this from happening. With the LDP and Komeito agreeing to field candidates locally against Osaka Ishin in April, the party could find its strength further reduced. According to a Mainichi Shimbun prediction, 31 of the 53 single-seat districts in Osaka Prefecture will be up for grabs in April, but, thanks to the LDP-Komeito cooperation agreement, Osaka Ishin will only win only two, with the other 29 going to the ruling coalition. The second factor in who wins what in Kansai is related to the first. Hashimoto wants to tie up with those from the DPJ’s more conservative wing — especially those who are not beholden to the Rengo trade union confederation or strong unions in general. Prominent DPJ politicians mentioned by pundits as possibly joining Hashimoto include Seiji Maehara, who represents Kyoto, as well as Goshi Hosono, who represents Shizuoka but was born, raised and went to school in Shiga and Kyoto prefectures. “We’re happy to cooperate with those DPJ members who share our goals. But not DPJ members like Kiyomi Tsujimoto,” said Osaka Gov. and Ishin Secretary-General Ichiro Matsui during a recent television appearance with Tsujimoto, a liberal Lower House member from Osaka who is strongly backed by workers’ unions. The DPJ and Ishin are already working to forge a cooperation agreement for at least some races in Kansai next April. In Kyoto, where Hashimoto and Ishin are generally unpopular because they’re seen as crude loudmouths from neighboring Osaka, the two parties are plotting a strategy that would ensure no Ishin candidate runs in the same district as a DPJ candidate for the Kyoto Municipal and Prefectural assembly elections. If this “Kyoto connection” by the DPJ and Ishin produces satisfactory results, it would likely lead to other efforts by the parties’ leaders to cooperate, at the local level at least. Finally, the other issue likely to play a major role in the April elections, and one the newly elected, or re-elected, Lower House members from Kansai will have to carefully manage, is the question of reactor restarts and electricity supply. With the announcements last week that the Nuclear Regulation Authority had cleared reactors 3 and 4 at the Takahama plant, helping smooth the way for Kansai Electric Power Co. to restart them next year, and that Kepco is planning to raise prices by as much as 10 percent next April not because of a projected rise in fuel costs, but to improve its bottom line, local voters are angry at the utility. The Takahama reactors are unlikely to be restarted until after the April elections. But the NRA decision has put the problem in a political spotlight the LDP had hoped to avoid.",

    "source": "In no-surprise poll, parties' main players re-elected in Kinki <eos> In an election that produced no surprises, it’s little wonder the biggest political names in the six prefectures that make up the Kinki region (Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Nara and Wakayama) were all returned to the Diet, though one or two had a close call. No doubt Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was especially happy with the result in the Nara No. 2 district, which includes the prefecture’s eastern edge along the border with Osaka and the city of Nara. There, his close friend, the ultra-right wing Sanae Takaichi, his internal affairs and communications minister, easily defeated a candidate from former Liberal Democratic Party heavyweight Ichiro Ozawa’s latest political incarnation, Seikatsu no To (People’s Life Party). Takaichi, who in 2003 lost her seat in the district and was forced to relocate to a more conservative, rural part of the prefecture, bagged over 96,000 votes, one of the highest totals among Kinki bloc winners and about 58,000 more than her Seikatsu no To rival. The man who unseated Takaichi in the city of Nara 11 years ago also had a big night. Sumio Mabuchi of the Democratic Party of Japan, the main opposition force, served in the DPJ Cabinet of Naoto Kan from 2010 to 2011 as transport minister and minister for Okinawa and the Northern Territories, and then as a special adviser to the prime minister following the March 2011 quake, tsunami and nuclear crisis. Mabuchi had a brief scare, running neck and neck with the LDP candidate for a couple of hours after the polls closed last Sunday. But he ended up with 79,000 votes, about 12,000 more than his rival. The other prominent DPJ candidate to win re-election was Kiyomi Tsujimoto, who took Osaka’s No. 10 district, which includes the city of Takatsuki, after a three-way battle involving a candidate from the LDP-Komeito ruling coalition and one from Ishin no To (Japan Innovation Party). Kenta Matsunami, the 43-year-old Ishin candidate, comes from a long line of Osaka politicians dogged by allegations of close ties to organized crime. But Matsunami is also a favorite of Ishin leaders Toru Hashimoto and Ichiro Matsui. Both campaigned hard on his behalf. He just managed to squeak back into the Diet under the proportional representation system. The other prominent DPJ member who cruised to victory was former Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara, from Kyoto’s No. 2 district, which includes much of the eastern part of the city of Kyoto. Maehara, who beat the ruling bloc-backed candidate by nearly 30,000 votes, enjoys the support of Kyocera Corp. founder Kazuo Inamori, who was appointed chairman of then-bankrupt Japan Airlines in 2010 after Maehara, who was then transport minister, pushed for him. But Kyoto was also where two of the LDP’s biggest heavyweights were returned to the Diet. Sadakazu Tanigaki, the party’s secretary-general, easily won re-election. He represents the Kyoto No. 5 district, a large, rural area in the northern part of the prefecture along the Sea of Japan. Extending from Hyogo Prefecture in the west to Fukui Prefecture in the east, it includes the port of Maizuru, likely to be a major evacuation point if disaster strikes Fukui’s Mihama nuclear power plant, which lies 5 km from parts of the city. Meanwhile, former LDP Finance Minister Bunmei Ibuki trounced his Japanese Communist Party candidate in the Kyoto No. 1 district, which includes the more central and western parts of the city of Kyoto, by a margin of 20,000 votes. With big local names from both the LDP and the DPJ back in the Diet, Kansai remains well-represented by the most powerful established parties. Despite the rise of Hashimoto’s Ishin no To these past few years, these parties remain as strong in Kansai as they are elsewhere.",

    "source": "'Right to be forgotten' on the Internet gains traction in Japan <eos> The Internet has made fact-checking easy and people routinely use it for this end, for example, to Google client names and personal backgrounds before their first business meeting, or to take a quick glance at a potential new hire’s reputation. But such information may become harder to acquire and background searches may someday yield little information. An increasing number of people are demanding that unflattering personal tidbits about them be deleted from online search results, especially in Europe, where moves to protect the “right to be forgotten” have gained momentum. At the same time, search engines are coming under greater pressure to act on such demands. Following are questions and answers regarding the legal issues surrounding the right to be forgotten: What is the “right to be forgotten” and how has the term come to be used? The right to be forgotten — an individual’s right to be freed from perpetual online stigmatization as a result of some past action — is stipulated in a draft version of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which the European Commission is trying to introduce to unify regulations on data protection within the EU. The term “right to be forgotten” became widely known worldwide following a May ruling by the European Court of Justice involving a Spanish man who demanded his past debt record be removed from the Internet. The court said a Spanish newspaper that carried articles about the man can leave them on its website, but Google must remove links to them, citing his “right to be forgotten after a certain time.” The court also said individuals have the right to demand that search engines, including Google, remove results that are deemed “inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive.” How has Google responded? California-based Google Inc. set up a special Web form for people in Europe to file requests for removal of search results. As of Dec. 2, Google had received 178,609 requests covering 630,919 Internet addresses. It has deleted some 60 percent of all considered for removal to date but refuses to remove the rest. Google’s action, however, means that only the links to the articles are deleted, not the websites themselves. Therefore, people can still access such sites if they know the URL. Has the European decision influenced Japan? Yes. In a possible first in Japan, the Tokyo District Court in October issued an injunction ordering Google to remove the titles and snippets to websites revealing the name of a man who claimed his privacy rights were violated due to articles hinting at past criminal activity. Tomohiro Kanda, who represented the man, said the judges clearly had the European court’s ruling in mind when they ordered Google to take down the site titles and snippets. Google has since deleted search results deemed by the court as infringing on the man’s privacy, Kanda said. But generally speaking, Japanese judges have yet to reach a consensus on how to balance the right to privacy and the freedom of expression and of information. Last January, the Tokyo High Court reversed a lower court ruling that forbade Google from showing predictions in its search bar. In that case, a man sought an injunction, saying searches of his name would turn up words that suggest his involvement in a crime he did not commit. Presiding Judge Kenta Suzuki turned down the request, saying the damage the man suffers from such searches “does not outweigh the damage that Google and other Internet users would suffer (from losing that function).” The man has appealed the case to the Supreme Court. Then in September, the Kyoto District Court rejected a suit filed against Google’s Japan unit by a man in his 40s seeking to have his arrest record removed from its search results. The judges said the case lacked legal grounds and sided with Google Japan’s position that it is the U.S. parent company, not the Japanese unit, that is responsible for managing searches and therefore it is not obliged to supervise them. In the absence of regulations, Yahoo Japan convened a panel of outside experts last month to discuss the issue. Yahoo Japan, which, according to a 2009 report by U.S.-based comScore, had a 51 percent share of all search inquiries in Japan, followed by Google’s 38 percent, aims to come up with its own criteria for removal of search results by the end of March. How are privacy rights defined in Japan? Does excessive protection of those rights hurt people’s right to know and the free flow of information? Privacy rights are not clearly written into Japanese law but have been established through court precedents as part of personal rights, said Kenta Yamada, a professor of media law and journalism at Senshu University. He said that the 2003 Personal Information Protection Law only stipulates what businesses should do in handling personal information and does not spell out individuals’ rights to privacy. Yamada said he is worried the October injunction by the Tokyo District Court “will pose a huge danger to the freedom of expression,” as it could be abused by politicians or others to silence critics. “Japan is unique in the world in that politicians are quick to sue the media for defamation,” he said. “It does not matter whether they win the cases or not. It is a form of threat, and can easily lead to self-censorship on the part of the media. The October injunction could fuel that trend.” But Yamada also said that from a purely legal standpoint, Japan’s protection of free speech is among the strongest in the world. Article 21 of the Constitution places no conditions on the freedom of expression, declaring that “freedom of speech, press and all other forms of expression are guaranteed” and that “no censorship shall be maintained.” Will Japan have more court cases brought by individuals? Undoubtedly. Attorney Kanda said he has been bombarded with requests from people wanting him to represent them. Also, the Tokyo District Court has seen a sharp increase in petitions for injunctions against malicious Internet postings, with the number of such petitions handled by the court growing more than 20-fold in four years, from 33 in 2009 to 711 in 2013, according to a recent report by Kyodo News citing court sources.",

    "source": "Obscenity arrest may be hiding dirty politics <eos> What constitutes obscenity in Japan? The term, both legally and morally, has different meanings in Japanese, just as it does in English. In a strictly legal sense, the Japanese word for obscenity, waisetsu , refers to something that maliciously stimulates sexual desire in an inappropriate and immoral manner. There are plenty of widely available publications nationwide that would appear to fall within this definition: manga that depicts incest, gang rape and sexual abuse of children, as well as magazines and newspapers that publish illustrated stories or photo shoots on similar themes. Some people might even be offended by the fact that sexual services not only appear to be legal, but they are advertised. You don’t have to look too hard to find clasifieds advertising rates for fellatio or anal sex — both of which are legal — and yet actual intercourse is only legal in some situations. Heavens, child pornography is still technically legal, or at least until the grace period for possessing such material runs out in the middle of next year. Which, again, begs the question: What constitutes obscenity? As far as the Metropolitan Police Department appears to be concerned, a plaster cast of a woman’s vagina is most certainly obscene. On Wednesday, police arrested artist Megumi Igarashi, who calls herself Rokudenashi-ko (“good-for-nothing girl”) on suspicion of sending a link “that shows her plan to create a boat using three-dimensional obscene data to a large number of people,” a police spokeswoman said. Sex toy shop manager Minori Watanabe, 44, was also arrested for “displaying obscene goods in her shop window in collusion with Igarashi” from around October 2013 until July, police said. It was the second arrest for Igarashi who was taken into police custody in July for distributing data that would allow people to make a 3-D replica of her vagina. The arrest in July garnered international attention, with rights groups accusing police of censorship and discrimination. So why did police officers arrest Igarashi again last week? In an article titled “Suppression of free speech: arrested author vanguard of Abe criticism” on Dec. 4, the Nikkan Gendai went as far to suggest the target this time was Watanabe, an author who works under the name Minori Kitahara. Kitahara has also been an acerbic critic of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The newspaper implies that the arrest may be a warning to other critics who have questioned the timing of the upcoming elections. The implication is perhaps not as whacky as it sounds. In an interview with the Asahi Shimbun in June, Kitahara dumped some fairly hefty criticism on Abe and his cronies. “I want to say to Abe, ‘Eat a strawberry in one bite (without a fork). Conduct politics like an adult,'” Kitahara said. “Since Abe came to power, the state secrets law has been passed and the Diet has reinterpreted (the principle of) collective self-defense,” she said. “It’s not a coincidence. We live in a world where hate speech flourishes and we’re closer to going to other countries to kill people. I feel as if we are no longer allowed to criticize the state. It’s scary.” Japan’s security forces have arrested opposition leaders and suppressed dissent before. On April 22, 2002, Tamaki Mitsui, former head of the public security department at the Osaka High Court Prosecutor’s Office, was arrested on corruption charges — the same day he was going to appear on television and expose prosecutors for using investigative funds for wining and dining. It’s not a secret that Abe hates criticism just as much as he hates the Asahi, the country’s liberal paper. When the Asahi admitted errors in past reports on “comfort women,” he publicly accused them of “shaming Japan.” Is it possible that someone in the Abe administration put pressure on the Metropolitan Police Department to silence Watanabe? Theoretically, yes. Abe himself gets to appoint the head of the Public Safety Commission that oversees the National Police Agency. Moreover, the police are almost obligated to make an arrest if a crime has been committed, however minor. I personally don’t believe Abe would ever put pressure on the police department himself, but his loyal posse? Maybe. With the state secrets law coming into effect on Dec. 10, it’s unlikely we’ll ever know. The new law stipulates that asking questions about a state secret — whether or not you even know it’s a secret — is a felony that may earn violators up to five years in jail for “instigating” a leak. This brings us back full circle to the original question: What constitutes obscenity? Some would argue that the state secrets law the Abe administration passed in December 2013 despite overwhelming public opposition is obscene. What’s more, it’s equally obscene to stifle any last-minute debate on its enactment by making sure that the press are occupied with election coverage. On this note, it’s also offensive for Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga on Nov. 19 to tell reporters that “we shouldn’t question the details of the secrecy laws one by one. The ruling party decides what the vote of confidence is all about. This election is about ‘Abenomics.'” That’s Liberal Democratic Party freedom of the press principles in a nutshell: We tell you what the election is about, don’t introduce other issues. Shortly before her arrest, Watanabe posted “Sayonara Abe government”in a tweet and then recommended 100 LDP politicians who should be defeated in the next election. In hindsight, was this a mistake? Perhaps Watanabe’s real mistake was questioning the reason for the election in the first place. Those of us who are not incarcerated can still ask such questions — at least until Dec. 10. After Dec. 10, asking such a question may itself be a crime. Whatever punishment is meted out for asking such questions, the answer is always going to be the same: “We are not able to answer that question; it’s a secret.” In a free and democratic society, that’s really obscene.",

    "source": "Opening WWI naval operations ended; U.S. architect plans Manchuria housing; Tokyo smog more poisonous; Ebola monkeys spur warning <eos> 100 YEARS AGO Saturday, Dec. 5 1914 First part of WWI naval operations successful The Navy Department yesterday published a survey of the operations of the different squadrons and divisions of the Imperial Navy since the outbreak of the world war, and announced that the first part of the operations has come to an end. In the early part of November, the survey noted, Germany’s warships in Kiaochou Bay, Hawaiian waters and the Indian Ocean all came to grief at the hands of the Imperial Navy. The rest of the enemy’s fleet are now known to have fled toward Chilean waters, thus marking the beginning of a new phase in operations. 75 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Dec. 10, 1939 U.S. architect plans housing for Manchuria Dwellings for Japanese residents in Manchurian cities should be remodeled, in consideration of the colder climate and their traditional living habits, says Dr. W.M. Vories, a noted American architect who plans to build a model Manchoukuo apartment house in Mukden. Dr. Vories stated that a better ventilation system for houses in Manchuria is urgently needed as the Japanese people, mostly unused to such severe winter conditions as they find there, are too frequently inclined to shut themselves tightly indoors during the lengthy cold season. As a result, they contract pulmonary ailments, noticeable among the second generation. The veteran architect has devised an inexpensive system of indirect ventilation that he will install in the projected Mukden apartment building. The architect plans to open a branch office in that city, and believes the prospects for the success of his new Manchurian venture are good. Having lived and prospered for 35 years in Nippon and being a sincere well-wisher of the Japanese people, he said he would like to build comfortable, healthy buildings suited to this country for the Japanese and Manchou residents. Referring to his recent trip to America, he was at first amazed and almost dismayed by the intensity of the anti-Japanese sentiment there, he remarked. He found such regrettable feeling very strong among the church folk also. They alleged that the Japanese were trying to wipe out Christianity in East Asia, the same as the Nazis and Soviets have done in their countries. However, Dr. Vories thinks the arrival of Mr. Horinouchi as ambassador to Washington has had a salutary effect upon the American churchgoers, as the envoy is reputed to be a sincere Christian. The saner part of the population are beginning to see the issue of (the ongoing war in) China in a true light, he said. 50 YEARS AGO Thursday, Dec. 10, 1964 Tokyo’s smog whiter, far more poisonous For many Tokyoites, the acrid, dishwater-gray smog that often blankets the world’s largest city in winter has become almost a way of life. But year in, year out, the contents of toxic gases in the pallid veil known as smog are on the rise, despite a sharp decrease in smoke and soot particles in it. And in these days, it is not only the downtown area that suffers; it is seeping deep into suburbia. A survey by the Metropolitan Government’s Public Nuisance Department indicates: • Tokyo smog is becoming increasingly white. In downtown Tokyo, soot particles in the air have decreased by half since 1959. • The sulphurous acid gas content in the air has increased more than nine times since 25 years ago. The nitrous acid gas level is now as high as in Los Angeles. All this means the air looks cleaner but is actually getting dirtier and more toxic. “Air pollution in Tokyo could soon become as bad as that in London,” Yoshiaki Kawanami of the Public Nuisance Department said. The Metropolitan Government has been trying for years to get rid of air pollution. It extinguished dump fires, went after more than 12,000 factory smoke stacks and enforced stiff regulations on power plants and steel mills. Still, the progressively worsening smog is believed attributable to ever-increasing automobiles in the nation’s capital. More than 5 million automobiles now run in the city daily. One solution to the auto intoxication may be to equip all automobiles with “afterburner” devices, which are claimed to help eliminate hydrocarbons from exhaust gas. Still, they would be expensive — costing around $120 per vehicle. Another factor in the deterioration may be the fact that industrial plants are switching from coal to oil for fuel. It is still technically difficult for oil-burning facilities to prevent generation of gases. 25 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Dec. 10., 1989 Ebola monkeys in U.S. spur import warning An emergency advisory urging Japan to restrict importation of monkeys for research reached the National Institute of Health Thursday from the World Health Organization. It said a deadly virus never before found in animals has been discovered in rhesus monkeys shipped from the Philippines to the United States in November. The virus causes Ebola hemorrhagic fever, whose symptoms are acute headaches and internal bleeding. According to the WHO, Ebola disease was found among rhesus monkeys that died at a private research center for animal testing in Virginia. According to the National Institute of Health, the virus is easily transmitted to humans, but Japan has no quarantine system to block such diseases from abroad. Japan imports about 3,000 monkeys annually, mostly for experimental use. The quarantine of experimental monkeys is done voluntarily by dealers. Pet monkeys do not go through any checks. The monkeys were later discovered to have been infected with what became known as Reston virus, which is related to Ebola.",

What little they have is carried in plastic bags. They camp in abandoned homes, followed by stray dogs hoping to snag a morsel. Tens of thousands of migrants from the Middle East, Africa and Kosovo have been flooding in a torrent this year to Serbia’s border with Hungary, hoping to cross illegally into the European Union nation and flee west to a better life. Many have been on the road for months. The 180-km-long (111-mile-long) border between Serbia and Hungary is flat farmland. Sometimes the migrants camp in the border area for days, hiding amid the crops, playing hide and seek with border patrols. Graffiti in Arabic, torn transit papers, ragged shirts and garbage litter the fields. Serbian and Hungarian border teams carry night-vision equipment as they patrol the border night and day. The situation has become so bad so quickly that German police have recently come to help. Hungary is part of the European Union’s Schengen passport-free travel zone but many migrants are seeking to reach Germany and wealthier EU nations. Groups of five or six migrants, all in hoods, walk slowly along the highway or the rail tracks in Serbia, patiently waiting for the best time to try to cross. If they are caught, they are either sent back to Macedonia or they seek asylum in Serbia, which buys them more time. Others make it across only to run into Hungarian authorities — some 25,000 migrants have been detained in Hungary so far this year alone, compared to nearly 45,000 last year. This week, a van packed with more than 40 migrants swerved off the road in southern Serbia, injuring half of them, some seriously. The driver ran away.",

However, the result of the fast food chain’s latest experiment isn’t exactly edible. Starting in April, the company will launch a fragrance that will allow fast-food lovers to smell just like their beloved burgers. The perfume, named “Flame Grilled,” will be sold for one day only and exclusively at Burger Kings in Japan. A free Whopper is included in the purchase (at the high price of ¥5,000), so now you can eat your meal and smell like one too. The scent will be sold starting at precisely 10:30 a.m., just in time for an early lunch. As only a limited amount of bottles are being produced, Burger King fans will only be able to mist themselves with one bottle per customer. Many media outlets say they smell a long-game April Fool’s joke, but we’re tempted to believe that their aim is true. Burger King has even petitioned the Japanese government to make April 1 the unofficial “Whopper Day,” a move that suggests this may not all be pure mischief. Still skeptical? This isn’t the first time Burger King has tried to appeal to a sense other than taste. In 2008 the chain released “Flame,” a cologne hooked as “the scent of seduction with a hint of flame-broiled meat.” Take a look at its disturbing video as proof.",

    "source": "Police who stand with big sticks <eos> Dear Alice, I have noticed whenever I pass a police station in Japan, that there is almost always a policeman standing out front holding a pole. Is this some form of punishment? If not, what the heck is the rationale for using manpower in this way? It would seem a better use of taxpayer funds to have the officer doing something more useful. Nick T., Tokyo Dear Nick, When I got your question, the first thing I did was stroll over to my local police station to see if I could confirm your observation. Sure enough, right there at the front stood a handsome young officer, holding a very big stick. Sometimes the best approach is the direct approach, so I marched up and asked if he was in some kind of trouble. “Me?” he said, obviously taken aback. “No, not at all.” He then assured me he was engaged in official police business called ritsuban . Now before you add that to your flashcard pack, I should caution that it’s not exactly standard vocabulary. It’s not even listed in my big green Kenkyusha dictionary. And while it’s written with relatively easy characters— the ones for “stand” and “guard” — the Japanese friends I tried that combo on all misread it as “ tachiban .” I did find “ritsuban” in a bilingual glossary of police lingo, but the English equivalent offered was “point duty,” which is a term I’ve never heard before and probably doesn’t communicate much to the average English speaker. “Ritsuban” basically means to “stand guard.” It’s a practice that dates back to the early Meiji Era (1868-1912), when Japan set up its modern police system. But it’s important to understand that the officers you’ve seen outside police stations are doing more than protecting the facility and watching out for trouble. They are also making themselves visible to reassure citizens and deter those with criminal intent. Most importantly, though, they are making themselves accessible and available for anything that might come up, whether a true emergency or a simple request for directions. In effect, it’s like moving the front desk out onto the street. Some readers might appreciate a word, at this point, about the officer’s stick. It is called a keijō and isn’t meant to support the body while standing, as people sometimes presume, but rather to fend off possible attackers. It originates in a martial art developed centuries ago by samurai of the Fukuoka clan to subdue enemies with a minimum of bodily harm. The keijō was adopted as standard equipment by the Tokyo police around 1930, and it soon spread to police forces around the country. Today, Japanese police do carry guns, but whenever possible they respond with less deadly weapons first. You may have also noticed that police often stand out in front of kōban , the one or two-room substations found in neighborhoods throughout Japan. They are conducting ritsuban, too, even if they aren’t holding a stick. To get the facts on this, I requested an interview at the National Police Agency, which is the central coordinating agency and sets standards and policies for police forces throughout the country. Hiroki Okita, assistant director of the NPA’s Community Police Affairs Division, explained that ritsuban is one of the most basic tools in Japanese-style community policing. “Every police officer in Japan, regardless of rank or specialty, has conducted ritsuban at some point in his or her career,” he told me. “In Japan, our emphasis is on early intervention and crime prevention, through vigilance and close engagement with residents. The kōban is the center of that activity, and the first assignment for every graduate of the police academy is to work at a kōban as a chiiki keisastukan (community police officer). There are more than 87,000 officers — about one third of the national force — currently working at the kōban level, about 7 percent of whom are women. The main responsibilities of a community police officer, as mandated by law, are to conduct patorōru (patrols on foot or bicycle); go out on junkai renraku (routine visits to homes and workplaces to offer crime-prevention advice, listen to residents’ concerns and take down emergency contact information); and, of course, to conduct ritsuban. At kōban, officers can decide for themselves whether or not to hold a keijō while on ritsuban duty. Often they do without, in order to appear friendlier and more approachable. Visible policing makes residents feel safer, according to Okita, and acts as a deterrent to crime. It’s difficult, obviously, to quantify either factor, but communities do lobby regularly for increased patrols as well as keeping kōban staffed around the clock. And every year there are cases when an officer on ritsuban catches a criminal or stops a crime before it can happen. Okita shared one arresting example of an officer who was doing ritsuban duty outside a kōban at a busy Tokyo intersection. He noticed an elderly lady passing by who looked tired and disoriented, so he approached her and offered her a seat inside. As she was resting, he engaged her in conversation and learned she had just come to Tokyo and was on her way to deliver money to her son. The officer immediately suspected one of the so-called “ Ore, ore ” (“It’s me”) scams, in which fraudsters telephone elderly people and pretend to be a relative in urgent need of money to help them out of a jam. (Last year, such scams bilked unsuspecting Japanese of more than ¥40 billion). He convinced the woman to let him help her call her son, who, it turned out, had not contacted her and had no idea she was in Tokyo. The fraud might well have succeeded if the officer hadn’t been outside and noticed the woman appeared stressed. “Ritsuban teaches an officer to be observant, and to become sensitive to even small changes that signal that something is not right,” Okita explained. “It’s the very basis of Japanese police work — the starting point from which everything else evolves.”",

The Kumkop General Foodstuff Factory for Sportspersons, which was established in 2011, sent its pastry chefs to train in France last year as part of a drive to become a world-class food plant, the Choson Sinbo said. The daily, published by the association of North Korean residents in Japan, said in a report from Pyongyang that the wholewheat baguette had proved a hit. The North’s leader, Kim Jong Un, personally visited the factory in January. “He said that the factory should wage a dynamic drive for developing and producing foodstuff including chewing gum which is badly needed by the sportspersons and suited to the constitution of the Koreans,” the North’s official KCNA news agency said.

    "source": "Will Line put the brakes on Uber with its taxi app? <eos> In the not-so-distant future, it might be considered quaint to hail a taxi with your hand instead of using a smartphone app. Line Corporation, after expanding its mobile business with game apps and online purchases, is expanding its smartphone messaging platform with a new service called Line Taxi for users to book cabs in Tokyo via its app. Launched in January, users simply type their address into the app and, with GPS, the taxi’s dispatch time appears on the map. The taxi ride is automatically paid for using a pre-registered credit card, so there is no need to worry about having cash on hand. Line hopes the app will be useful for people who don’t want to fight over cabs during rush hour. Competitor Uber, a taxi booking app that’s already available in 55 countries , already expanded its service to Tokyo last spring and has many similar features to Line Taxi. However, along with Uber’s global expansion has come a series of huge bumps in the road, including an Uber driver being accused of raping a passenger in India in December 2014, and in the same month in Australia, Uber was harshly criticized for jacking up prices during the hostage situation in downtown Sydney . (They quickly apologized for the snafu .) Uber has also come under fire after testing out its services in Fukuoka. The government told the company to suspend its pilot project as the Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry believes that the smartphone application service likely violates the Road Transportation Law prohibiting unlicensed taxi services. Although Line Taxi doesn’t have the premium service of luxury cars like Uber, the face that Line’s partner is Nihon Kotsu, Japan’s largest taxi company, means there might not be a big gap between the two. More than 3,000 taxis will be connected to Line, and the company plans to include more than 23,000 taxis for its service nationwide. Currently Line Taxi is only available in Japanese and the fare has to be paid with a Japanese credit card, but the app is expected to become more foreigner-friendly in the future and expand coverage throughout Japan. The company first said that they wanted to take their taxi service global since previewing it last October. So what’s it going to be? Will you get in Line?",

    "source": "India asks Saudi to help evacuate citizens from grave situation in Yemen <eos> THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, INDIA - India asked Saudi Arabia on Monday to help evacuate its citizens from Yemen, where more than 4,000 Indians, over half of them nurses, are caught up in fighting. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office said he had spoken by telephone with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and requested Riyadh’s “support and cooperation in the evacuation of Indian citizens from Yemen.” King Salman assured Modi of all possible assistance to help them leave, it said in a statement. Two Air India planes on standby in neighboring Oman were unable to fly in to the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Monday despite what Indian officials said earlier were Saudi assurances that an air corridor would be opened. The nurses, mostly from the southern state of Kerala, are often hired on harsh terms with middlemen taking up-front fees. Hospitals are reluctant to let them leave because they would have to close without foreign staff. Sajeesh Mathew’s wife, 29-year-old nurse Asha, has worked for three years at the Al-Naqib Hospital in the port city of Aden, scene of fighting following the flight of Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi last week. “The areas around the hospital are now under the control of the Houthi rebels,” said Mathew, whose wife is one of 35 Indian nurses at the hospital. Although no Indian casualties have been reported, the nurses’ predicament in Yemen recalls the ordeal suffered by 46 Indian nurses kidnapped in Iraq last year as Islamic State militants advanced on Tikrit. The nurses were freed in June, in an early diplomatic triumph for Modi, but the fate of 39 Indian building workers captured in Mosul remains unclear. Eighty Indians were flown out on Sunday to Djibouti, on the opposite shore of the Gulf of Aden, but no evacuation flights were possible on Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said. He said 400 Indians were being evacuated by sea from Aden and would reach Djibouti on Tuesday. They will be flown home by the Indian Air Force. New Delhi has issued a series of warnings this year to Indian nationals to leave Yemen, the last of them shortly before Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes on March 26 against Iranian-allied Houthi militiamen. Ruben Jacob Chandy heeded the call, taking a flight out of Sanaa and arriving back in the Keralan capital Thiruvananthapuram on Monday with a handful of other Indians who escaped the fighting. “The situation is critical,” said Chandy. “The Saudis are carrying out a lot of air targeting — it starts from 6 p.m. until almost 6 a.m.” An Indian navy patrol vessel involved in anti-piracy operations was heading for Aden, and would be joined by two more navy ships. Two passenger ships with the capacity to carry 1,100 people had also set sail from India, Akbaruddin said. Indians returning from Yemen said the situation, especially in Aden, was grave. “They cannot go out of their residences. Many are running out of water and food,” said Lijo George, an IT worker who returned to Kerala on Monday from Sanaa. Speaking from the Military Hospital in Sanaa, paramedic Ranjith Cheerakathil said he and his wife, a nurse, had decided to stay. Most of the 240 Indian staff were waiting for a flight out. “Most of the operations in the hospital will be shut down when they leave. There will not be anybody to care for those who suffer injuries in the attack,” Cheerakathil said by telephone. “This is cruel. My conscience does not allow me to leave them like that.”",

    "source": "Foreign tourists posing nude at temples infuriate Cambodians <eos> SIEM, REAP CAMBODIA - Cambodia’s most popular tourist attraction — the complex of ancient temples that includes Angkor Wat — is suffering from a form of overexposure: At least five foreign visitors have been arrested and deported this year for taking nude photos at the sacred sites. Authorities have no tolerance for people stripping down at Angkor Archaeological Park, a sprawling, centuries-old UNESCO World Heritage Site that drew 2 million visitors last year. The incidents are also upsetting to ordinary Cambodians, for whom the Khmer-era complex holds enormous spiritual and historical significance. “Angkor Wat is the most famous sacred … temple in Cambodia, where everyone — not only tourists but also Cambodians themselves — has to pay respect,” said Rattanak Te, an administrative assistant who lives in Phnom Penh, the capital. “It definitely upsets me and all Cambodians, because outsiders will think we — Cambodian people — are careless and do not take good care of this World Heritage (site) by allowing these tourists to do such an unacceptable act.” This month, guards arrested two American sisters after seeing them snap photos of each other’s naked backsides in the temple of Preah Khan, said Kerya Chau Sun, spokeswoman for the Apsara Authority, which manages the temple complex in Siem Reap, in northwestern Cambodia. Lindsey Adams, 22, and Leslie Adams, 20, both of Prescott, Arizona, were each sentenced to a six-month suspended sentence, a fine of 1 million riel ($250), deportation and a four-year ban from the country. In January, three French men in their 20s were deported after they were caught taking nude photographs at Angkor complex. Another photo showing a topless woman at the site has circulated on social media, but officials believe it is fake, according to Chau Sun. Three tourists were also caught riding a motorbike naked near Phnom Penh in January, according to local media. Reached via email, one of the Frenchmen, Rodolphe Fourgeot, said he did not want to talk about the case. He said it demonstrates “endemic corruption” in Cambodia but did not elaborate. A message on a cellphone listed for Lindsey Adams said the voicemail was full and not accepting messages. She also didn’t respond to a Facebook message. A message was left on a cellphone number listed for the sisters’ mother. This year’s incidents were not firsts for the Angkor temples, but Chau Sun said earlier attempts by tourists to get naked were thwarted. Signs at the temples and ticketing booths urge visitors to behave respectfully, and Chau Sun said the Apsara Authority plans to add posters warning them that taking nude photographs can lead to arrest and deportation. “As a Cambodian, I am hurt … I think especially to the poor Cambodians saving to be able to come across the country to pray at Angkor,” she said. “They don’t understand why people could behave like that.” Angkor Archaeological Park is the biggest tourist draw for this Southeast Asian country, which still feels the effects of the Khmer Rouge, the fanatical communist regime behind a reign of terror that left an estimated 1.7 million people dead from 1975 to 1979. The massive Angkor complex is in a sense a proud counterpoint to that painful legacy. It contains the remains of capitals of the Khmer Empire, which existed from the 9th to the 15th centuries and at its peak controlled most of Southeast Asia. For a time, Angkor was among the world’s biggest cities. The temples are renowned for their architecture and art, with countless intricate carvings, including semi-nude spirits known as apsaras. Angkor Wat is the largest and best preserved of the structures. The temples are much more than stone ruins for most Cambodians, said Trevor Sofield, a professor of tourism at the University of Tasmania in Australia. They are places of Buddhist worship as well as a symbol of the Khmer heritage, he said. He added that the Apsara Authority and UNESCO should focus on educating the public about the living sacred nature of the site in addition to its historical characteristics. Angkor is not the only world-renowned site that has had to deal with nude tourists. In 2014, officials at Peru’s Machu Picchu said they were increasing surveillance after visitors were caught taking nude photographs or running through the ancient site naked. Amichay Rab, a 32-year-old accountant from Tel Aviv, was one of those tourists who posed in the buff. Rab documented his nude escapades while on a nine-month trip through Central and South America on his blog. Many of the photos were taken early in the morning before there were crowds, he said, and local residents often snapped the photos for him. “I was anxious sometimes but was never afraid (of) getting in trouble as I was very discreet,” he said. “I was waiting for the right moment in order to avoid hurting someone’s feelings.” Cambodian Mollyda Keo said people there recognize that different cultures and societies have differing views on the body and what is deemed acceptable. Cambodian women, for example, will only swim in a T-shirt and shorts but are used to seeing Western women in bikinis, she said. She said posing naked at the temples crosses the line. “I just feel they don’t respect the culture,” she said. “You come from another culture. You should respect ours.”",

    "source": "When nature evolves to be awesome <eos> A few years ago, an anthropologist told me an amazing story about a wild chimpanzee she had observed in Senegal. A bushfire had ignited in the summer heat, and she saw a chimp stand upright on its hind legs, face the fire and perform “a really exaggerated slow-motion display.” The chimpanzee then started barking, apparently communicating with other chimps sheltering nearby. The anthropologist, Jill Pruetz of Iowa State University in Ames, said this kind of barking had never been heard in her roughly 2,000 hours of observations of chimps. What was the chimpanzee doing? It appears it was monitoring the fire. The community of chimps retreated a short distance as the fire approached, but remained calm. Other animals panic and stampede when they encounter fire, but these chimps, perhaps because they have experienced bushfires in the past, apparently knew what it was — they understood the concept of fire. But what was that weird, slow-motion dance? I couldn’t help but imagine it as a primitive kind of worship to some kind of fire god. Other chimps have been reported performing strange dances when they encounter unusual natural phenomena such as rainstorms or waterfalls. Perhaps it is an expression of awe in the face of natural power? As a flight of fancy, I like to think that this sort of behavior lies at the evolutionary root of our worship of natural spiritual powers. I remembered all this a couple of weeks ago when, to my surprise, I experienced the same feelings of awe. I was in Yosemite National Park in California. Tired after a day in which I had hiked some 20 km, I arrived at the Tuolumne Grove of Giant Sequoias. Tired? Who am I kidding — my legs had practically given out. I was hobbling with the aid of a stick I’d found on the path. My friend and I walked another kilometer or so through a forest of giant conifers. It was around 5 p.m., and no one else was around. The only sound was the occasional echoing drumming of woodpeckers. We stared open-mouthed at what we thought were sequoias, towering above us. Amazing, we said. We walked some more. Then we came upon what was self-evidently a real giant sequoia. The others had just been big trees. The giant sequoia is the world’s largest tree and, measured by volume, is the largest living thing in the world. This one was truly massive, some 80 meters tall and maybe 3,000 years old. I felt something stir inside me. To be next to this thing was mind-boggling. I felt like a chimp that had discovered a waterfall, or a forest fire. There are some 25 giant sequoia in the Tuolumne Grove. A couple have fallen. I clambered on one, which lay like the backbone of some gigantic sea monster across the forest floor. I took some photos, but it’s hard to capture the scale, and even more difficult to communicate the pine-scented chilled mountain air, the isolation and the feeling of diminishment. What I was experiencing, of course, was awe. The feeling is captured in Japanese in the phrase ikei no nen , meaning reverence, awe and respect. I felt all these things. But why? That’s the question evolutionary biologists (and children) always ask. Why did such-and-such a behavior evolve? What is the evolutionary reason for feelings of awe? Dacher Keltner of the University of California, Berkeley, and Jonathan Haidt of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, considered this question in a paper published in the journal Cognition and Emotion. They suggest that awe evolved from the hard-wired response automatically felt when a low-status individual encounters a more powerful, high-status individual. We’ve all experienced that and, in Japan at least, the high-status/low-status ranking is embedded in the language. This “know-your-place” feeling helps reinforce rankings in a social group. Keltner and Haidt believe the awe response developed from the status-response, and arises when people — and maybe other animals — encounter any powerful natural phenomenon or work of sublime beauty: a waterfall, a breaching whale, a giant sequoia. It also arises when we hear a sublime piece of music or art or understand a profound scientific explanation — such as natural selection. Many things in biology can be better understood by examining how they evolved. They start off as one thing and are later used for another. An example is feathers, which probably evolved to keep dinosaurs warm and were later used to help them fly. Keltner and his colleagues also believe that awe helps to direct attention to the environment. When encountering something new, complex and powerful, the feeling of awe helps the brain focus and process the information it is receiving. This, Keltner and his colleagues argue, gives a survival advantage and so is favored by natural selection. Could awe help focus the mind on environmental issues? A sense of wonder about natural beauty can drive support and action for environmentally sensitive policies. This was not what Keltner and his colleagues were referring to, but the point is worth making. Giant sequoias, found only in the Sierra Nevada mountains, are classified as endangered. They live in humid climates where summers are dry and winters are snowy. Climate change may well pose a threat to them. While giant sequoias are only found in limited parts of the western United States, there is a related tree in Japan that rivals the majesty of the sequoias: the Japanese redwood, or sugi . The sugi is the national tree of Japan. You don’t need to hike in the mountains to see them; sugi are typically planted at shrines and many have been designated special natural monuments. Ishikawa Prefecture, for example, has the great sugi of Kayano, a 55-meter-tall tree that is some 2,300 years old. I say “planted at shrines” but when a tree is this old, it is more likely the shrine was built near the tree. The Jomon sugi of Yakushima Island is named after the prehistorical period of Japanese history and the Jomon sugi has been estimated to be anywhere from 2,100 to 7,000 years old — though the lower end seems more likely. Around some ancient sugi, artefacts from the Jomon period have been discovered. That, as the kids say, is awesome.",

    "source": "Of birds and bugs: journalism in Tokyo and Osaka <eos> One of the first things Tokyoites who relocate to Osaka notice is that, while their favorite mainstream media news source is available in both cities, the tone and often substance of the reporting is different. It’s a cliche among Japan watchers that “Japanese newspapers and TV news are all the same.” Yes, one sees the similarities easier than the differences. But it’s equally false to imply that readers of the five major newspapers or viewers of the major TV networks receive exactly the same views about the same subjects. Fundamentally, Tokyo journalism emphasizes a “bird’s-eye view” of news topics, and encourages a dry, and often humorless, tone about major events. How can one be possibly taken seriously when discussing serious topics unless one is, well, serious? There are, of course, advantages to bird’s-eye journalism. Breadth and width for starters. Journalists are, by nature, generalists. The Tokyo-style of journalism, at its best, encourages a wide variety of basic knowledge about different subjects, especially those of comparatively little interest to the Osaka journalism philosophy: politics and international affairs. Too many Osaka reporters, editors and producers simply don’t care about what’s happening in the halls of power in Tokyo, let alone abroad. And when confronted with a Tokyo-style journalism critique of themselves that is far deeper than the usual clever but politically correct comments and cliches in local media, they become thin-skinned. In a recent TV Osaka program about the city, its politics and how it was viewed by the outside world, Tokyo-based journalist Akira Ikegami provided a cool, somewhat verbose and yet concise analysis of Osaka. The Osaka commentators who sat alongside Ikegami attempted to make light of the report’s more critical comments at first. But as his detailed — and extremely accurate — analysis continued, a couple of panelists grew visibly annoyed at Ikegami’s style. “Well, it can’t be helped,” grumbled one of the Osaka-based tarento , after interviews were shown with foreign visitors about Osakans’ notoriously bad manners. The disadvantage of bird’s-eye journalism is that it overlooks important details and can lack the human touch. Defenders of Tokyo-style journalism might retort that their reporting style is “cool,” “dispassionate,” and “objective.” However, that can sometimes feel “cold,” “boring,” and “detached” to a lot of people in Osaka (as well as in Tohoku, Okinawa and among foreign readers of Japanese news). Osaka journalism, by contrast, traditionally offers a “bug’s-eye view” of the world, focusing on various crimes, follies, tragedies and victories of ordinary people. At its best, traditional Osaka-style journalism is progressive on human rights issues and sometimes more sensitive to the country’s ethnic and cultural minorities than the Tokyo media. In 2012, Shukan Asahi was forced to apologize to Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto after it ran a cover story titled “Hashishita yatsu no honsho” (“The true nature of Hashishita” — the kanji for Hashimoto’s name can also be read as “Hashishita,” and that’s how it used to be pronounced in traditional buraku communities). Hashimoto, who has buraku roots, took offense at what he felt was discrimination on the part of the magazine. Why did Shukan Asahi use “Hashishita”? Theories abound. However, veteran Osaka journalists quietly say that an editor from Osaka would have been more sensitive to the history of buraku discrimination than a clueless Tokyoite, and the word “Hashishita” would have not been used. Not, at least, in that way. Ironically, the Japanese-language newspaper that perhaps best represents the progressive, and sometimes cheeky, spirit of traditional Osaka journalism is the Tokyo Shimbun. It has a growing reputation for providing a bug’s-eye view of the details with a bird’s-eye analysis, proving the best journalism is, in fact, a combination of both styles.",

    "source": "Nation stiffens defenses to counter invasion <eos> Doom was closing in. It was greeted with anxiety but without surprise. Its coming had been foreseen. Two centuries earlier — in the seventh year of the Eisho Era, 1052 by the Western calendar — humanity had entered the degenerate age of Mappo, the Latter Days of the Law. So taught the Buddhist sages. What did this mean, practically speaking? Political disorder, cosmic disorder, evil beyond anything imaginable — or maybe good beyond anything imaginable, for had not Amida, the “Buddha of boundless light,” vowed eons earlier to save all who faithfully called on him? The principal preachers of the new Amidist sect were Honen (1133-1212) and Shinran (1173-1263). Their vision of a “Pure Land” of radiant jewels, glittering palaces, celestial music and “the light radiating from the Buddha” took hold among a population slowly sinking into earthly despair. Only believe, pleaded Honen and Shinran, and rebirth in the Pure Land will surely follow. Nonsense, sneered the third great preacher of revivalist “Kamakura Buddhism” — so named for the Kamakura Period (1185-1333) in which it thrived. “Pure Land”? No such thing, scoffed Nichiren (1222-82) — not while humanity remained mired in sin. He saw one way out: mass conversion to his own teaching — which was what? A notion so unprecedented in Japanese history that Nichiren was exiled, arrested and very nearly executed for his temerity. The traditional Buddhist sects, powerful though they were, had always acknowledged themselves servants and protectors of the state. They did not, unlike the contemporary European medieval Christian church, claim to be its masters. Nichiren made that claim for them. For Nichiren, religion — Buddhism — was paramount; the state, secondary. Scorning all efforts to silence him, he preached on. The earthquake of 1257 was nothing, he said; likewise the famine and plague that followed. Worse was coming. What could be worse? A foreign host, unleashed by heaven to chastise a sinning nation. How many Japanese at that point would even have heard of the Mongols, let alone quailed at the mention of their name? How much did Nichiren himself know? And yet “they blew up like a hurricane,” writes historian J.M. Roberts, “to terrify half a dozen civilizations, slaughter(ing) and destroy(ing) on a scale the 20th century alone has emulated.” The story begins with the conquests of Genghis Khan early in the 13th century. By the time his grandson, Kublai Khan, forced himself on Japan’s attention, the Mongols ruled the largest land empire in history, twice the size of the Roman Empire at its peak. China, Korea, Russia and Central Asia were swallowed; Eastern Europe barely escaped. In 1268, Kublai dispatched a letter to the “king of Japan.” “We,” it read, “the great Mongolian Empire, have received the Mandate of Heaven and have become the master of the universe. Therefore, innumerable states in far-off lands have longed to form ties with us.” Why not Japan? asked Kublai. “From now on,” he wrote, “let us enter into friendly relations with each other. Nobody would wish to resort to arms.” Master by conquest of half the globe and yet reluctant to “resort to arms”? A strange note to strike — what did it mean? Japan by then had had no official relations with China in almost 400 years. Merchants and monks still traveled back and forth on private business, but neither the military government in Kamakura nor the Imperial court in Kyoto had very clear notions of what was transpiring in the country that once had been Japan’s revered teacher in the arts of civilization. Maybe this is why, as historian George Sansom puts it, “The Japanese at first made the mistake of despising their enemy.” Kublai’s letter went unanswered, his envoys dismissed with contempt. Subsequent Mongol envoys were beheaded. Still Kublai remained patient — why? “The use of military force without reason,” he wrote shortly afterwards, “runs counter to Confucian and Buddhist teaching. Because Japan is a divine country, we do not intend to fight with force.” This too was ignored. Patience has its limits. The Mongol fleet sailed at last, on the third day of the 10th lunar month of 1274. First to feel its wrath were the tiny islands of Tsushima and Iki, whose inhabitants, writes Sansom, “were treated with revolting cruelty.” Then it was Kyushu’s turn. But the harsh lessons of war, in this the only foreign invasion Japan had ever suffered, or ever would suffer until the Americans came calling in the 19th century, were destined to be taught by the insular Japanese, and learned, at great cost to themselves, by the world-conquering Mongols. Where were Japan’s poets and bards in those fraught years? Alive and well — busy composing the magnificent Tales of the Heike in memory of the civil wars (1156-85) that marked the nation’s passage from elegant, decadent, aristocratic pacifism to one of the hardiest militarisms the world has ever known. Celebrated in history and nationalist mythology for the “divine wind” ( kamikaze ) that blew the Mongol fleet to smithereens in 1274 and again in 1281, Japan’s most heroic battles escaped the shaping hand of literary genius — there is no Tales of the Mongols. Typhoons played their part, no doubt, but Japanese defenders — numbering in the hundreds against thousands; fighting “in loose formation or in no formation at all” (Sansom) against a tightly drilled, highly disciplined army; wielding swords against poisoned arrows and catapults and Chinese firearms — surely deserved a better memorial than history or literature has accorded them. While the fighters fought and the winds blew and the nation stiffened its defenses against anticipated future invasions, prayers rang through the land. “Here is what I have heard,” wrote an anonymous court noble in the 14th-century chronicle The Clear Mirror. “Just as the Great Wisdom (Sutra) recitations at Iwashimizu (Temple) reached their climax, a single black cloud suddenly appeared in the clear sky. … Huge waves sprang up, and the entire invasion force drowned in the wild waters. It was wondrous proof that ours is indeed the land of the gods” — a notion with a long and baleful history ahead of it.",

    "source": "First wave of April elections litmus test for Osaka merger plan <eos> For most prefectures, cities and towns, April’s quadrennial unified elections will be the last opportunity for the next few years to vote on local matters. But in the city of Osaka, the April 12 assembly poll is but a barometer — albeit a crucial one — for the May 17 referendum that will decide whether the city will be fundamentally restructured. After choosing a new municipal assembly next month, Osaka’s 2.1 million voters will then be asked to vote yes or no on the question of whether the city’s current 24 wards should be integrated into five large semi-autonomous areas, each with its own elected head and assembly. This would also mean abolishing the Osaka mayor and municipal assembly by 2017. The most recent media polls indicate the vote is likely to be close and that the pro-merger camp is gaining ground. Surveys by Kyodo News, the Mainichi Shimbun and Sankei Shimbun dailies in mid-March showed around 43 percent of the respondents favored the merger and 41 percent opposed it. That’s a change from an Asahi Shimbun poll earlier this year, where more opposed the plan than supported it. The reasons for the shift toward support vary. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga have said the referendum is “significant,” which the pro-merger camp, led by Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, welcomed as a huge boost to its efforts. In addition, Hashimoto and Osaka Gov. Ichiro Matsui have barnstormed the city in recent weeks to push the plan, saying it will make Osaka efficient, more streamlined, more democratic and reinvigorate the local economy. The sight of Hashimoto and Matsui speaking on street corners, often in cold and windy weather, carefully going through detailed flip-charts of the plan for passersby, has convinced many that Hashimoto, if nothing else, is earnest in his desire to sell the plan. In the meantime, merger opponents, including the local chapters of the Liberal Democratic Party, Komeito, the Democratic Party of Japan and Japanese Communist Party, have found themselves on the defensive these past few months, forced at every turn to provide counter-arguments to the media-savvy Hashimoto rather than clearly articulate a detailed, alternate vision for the city. The result is that they sometimes sound like stern accountants, schoolmasters, or even parents saying “no.” Not the kind of image likely to sway lots of younger Osaka voters who, if the recent media polls are to be believed, tend to be more supportive of the merger plan than their elders. The Mainichi Shimbun poll showed that about 54 percent of voters in their 30s want the merger but only 33 percent of those in their 70s and above are in favor. Where city voters live also plays in role in their inclinations. In the tony areas of north and central Osaka, where many major firms have their offices, support for the merger appears somewhat strong. But in the more working-class districts, as well as the port area, opposition appears to be greater than support, as residents wonder if Hashimoto’s plan will increase the wealth and services gap with the more wealthy districts. However, it’s too early to predict how the referendum will turn out. Hashimoto himself has dismissed the latest polls, saying they’re always changing. Ultimately, the victorious side will be the one that wins the public debate in the coming weeks. The April 12 assembly elections, therefore, will determine which side will go into May enjoying the final, and probably decisive, political momentum in that debate.",

    "source": "Koga's parting shot may not hit its target <eos> In February, Reporters Without Borders published its annual list of countries ranked in terms of press freedom. Japan came in at No. 61, down two places from the previous year and lower than Taiwan (51) and South Korea (60). The reason for the decline was the state secrets act , which came into force last December and criminalizes the disclosure of classified information, whether by parties inside or outside the government. Japan had already been falling on the list. In 2010 it was No. 11. The sudden “deterioration in trust,” according to Kobe College professor Tatsuru Uchida , writing in Aera, was brought on by the “ambiguous” coverage of the March 2011 nuclear disaster and subsequent cleanup efforts. Uchida said the Japanese press did not sufficiently investigate the actions of Tokyo Electric Power Co. and the government, and as a result Reporters Without Borders assumed the country’s media was under their sway. It’s easy to accept these assertions if you closely follow Japanese media, but it’s difficult to find clear examples of press organs bowing to pressure from above, so when an example seems to present itself, it’s news. Last weekend, the media was buzzing over the dustup on TV Asahi’s “Hodo Station” between commentator Shigeaki Koga and anchor Ichiro Furutachi. Koga is the former Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry official who quit some years ago and has since made a living criticizing government policy. For a while he has been an occasional guest pundit on “Hodo Station,” which prides itself on more in-depth coverage than you get from other news shows. The producers appreciate Koga’s willingness to speak his mind, though their superiors at TV Asahi reportedly felt otherwise. Koga has explained publicly, through social media and other means, that he was told in January he would no longer appear on “Hodo Station” after April due to some of his on-air comments about the government’s handling of the hostage crisis, which ended with the death of two Japanese nationals at the hands of the Islamic State group. During a press conference at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan on Feb. 25 he said that TV Asahi executives are “trying to curry favor with the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,” and so they forced the producer of “Hodo Station” to let him go. Though it was not announced as such, Koga had assumed his March 27 appearance would be his last for the program. He was supposed to discuss the crisis in Yemen, but when Furutachi asked him for an analysis Koga changed the subject and mentioned he would be leaving the show due to the desires of TV Asahi’s top brass and Furutachi’s management company, which has a hand in the production. Such a revelation was unusual in and of itself — “Hodo Station” is broadcast live — but Furutachi compounded the surreal quality of the moment by contradicting Koga, saying it “isn’t the case” that he is being dropped. Koga replied that was odd as Furutachi had earlier apologized to him for “not being able to do anything” about the dismissal, and Koga could prove it since he recorded their conversation. He then went on to castigate Abe. Furutachi’s famous candor as an interviewer is a function of his prima donna attitude, and he obviously resented Koga for hijacking the show. TV Asahi was more forthcoming: Over the weekend, its PR department issued a statement blasting Koga, whose remarks about government involvement were “not based on fact.” It chastised him for rudeness and then apologized to viewers, even if the incident was probably the most entertaining thing that’s ever happened on “Hodo Station.” Adding to the excitement was a statement from Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga saying that the prime minister’s office had not put any pressure on TV Asahi to dump the ex-bureaucrat. We can only take Koga’s word for it that he was dropped from the show because of his views, but even if TV Asahi and the government are telling the truth, members of Japan’s mainstream press, unlike Koga, go easy on those in power as a matter of course, and not because they’re intimidated. In a recent piece in Gendai Business about the Reporters Without Borders ranking , former Tokyo Shimbun editor Yukihiro Hasegawa said there is no real press freedom in Japan, “but it has nothing to do with the secrecy act.” Most reporters would never leak confidential information because they aren’t, strictly speaking, reporters. “They are salarymen,” Hasegawa says, and care more about their positions within their companies than they do about their work: “They’re all in line waiting for promotions.” The notorious press clubs, where journalists regurgitate information spoon-fed to them by government organs, are designed so that every news outlet has a fair and equal shot at a story. “It’s an open secret,” Hasegawa points out, “that when reporters talk to politicians, they all share their memos with one another.” This means every news outlet reports the same information, the only difference being the outlet’s “ideology.” As to whether or not this helps the government, Hasegawa doesn’t think it makes any difference. “The media covered the collective forces issue thoroughly,” he says, referring to Abe’s efforts to allow the Self-Defense Forces to participate in military activities with allies, “but the public doesn’t know anything about it.” In a February interview with Mainichi Shimbun , also about press freedom, bestselling novelist Jiro Asada decried gumin shisō —limiting information so as to better control the people — but why should the government need to cultivate “ignorant masses” when the media is incapable of making the news relevant anyway? It’s worth noting that Hasegawa is a political conservative — he has no ethical problem with the secrecy act — who worked for the most liberal daily in Japan. He has seen firsthand how truth is at the service of expedience. Koga’s impromptu rant has drawn both admiration and condemnation, but in the end he’s just screaming into the void.",

    "source": "Learning valuable lessons from the yakuza? <eos> “He had connections and interactions with individuals related to the yakuza. Why on earth would he be appointed a (Cabinet) minister? The responsibility of the prime minister for appointing him to this position is tremendously weighty.” These angry words were said by a New Komeito Diet member in 2012. The Cabinet minister in question was Keishu Tanaka, a Democratic Party of Japan member appointed as the minister of justice. In contrast, Komeito and the Liberal Democratic Party have remained remarkably silent about the yakuza allegations surrounding Education Minister Hakubun Shimomura. Shimomura lobbied hard for his position in 2012 when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s LDP and Komeito coalition government seized power. He also spearheaded Abe’s program to bring back “moral education” in schools. If you have any ethical sensibilities he appears to be the quintessential hanmen kyōshi — “someone who teaches by setting a poor example.” Even without an education in morality, most people know that it’s wrong to take money from the yakuza or accept campaign contributions that may be possibly illegal. The scandal began in January, when the Akahata Shimbun reported that a front company for the country’s largest crime group, the Yamaguchi-gumi, had donated ¥180,000 over two years to a branch of the LDP — the Tokyo No. 11 district — headed by Shimomura. The company is banned from accepting public works and recognized by the police in Osaka as a yakuza operation, specifically a Yamaguchi-gumi Kodo-kai operation. (Remember that name — it comes up again.) The scandal didn’t attract a great deal of attention and interest in it waned after a short time. In February, however, the Shukan Bunshun reported that Shimomura had received illegal political funds, including contributions from another individual connected to — surprise, surprise — the Yamaguchi-gumi Kodo-kai. He quickly denied the allegations. The Shukan Bunshun and Sankei Shimbun have reported that regional support groups acting on Shimomura’s behalf had not been registered as political organizations and had improperly and, possibly, illegally collected funds on his behalf. These support groups, operating under regional organizations called hakuyūkai , were consortiums of private school and cram school owners. One might suspect a conflict of interest in them funding the man in charge of public education, but let’s put that issue aside for a second. The Political Funds Control Law obliges entities that support a politician or nominate a political candidate to register as a political group and submit reports on their income and expenditure of political funding. The groups run by Shimomura’s regional hakuyūkai failed to do this. When he appeared before the Lower House Budget Committee on Feb. 26, Shimomura said he had never received a donation from the regional groups, nor had he ever received money for “taxi fares” or “travel expenses.” He also described the political groups as voluntary organizations set up by friends in the education industry. At first, Shimomura said he planned to protest over the magazine’s report. He also denied receiving a ¥100,000 donation in 2009 from Masahiro Toyokawa, a yakuza associate and former cram school operator. Police sources say Toyokawa is a longtime associate member of the Yamaguchi-gumi — specifically, the Kodo-kai — and that Toyokawa and Shimomura had known each other for several years. They believe that Toyokawa may still be running cram schools from behind the scenes. Toyokawa also reportedly loaned roughly $6 million to a chain of massage parlors known to be paying protection money to the Yamaguchi-gumi, according to several reports. Toyokawa is important because he was also a central figure in creating the Chubu Hakuyūkai, one of the main political groups collecting funds for Shimomura. Shimomura has changed his story several times and even admitted that his secretary had urged regional support groups not to speak to reporters about allegations of financial irregularities. He has also admitted to receiving the ¥100,000 donation from Toyokawa, reversing previous denials. A former executive member of a hakuyūkai support group held a news conference last month, during which she admitted giving Shimomura an additional ¥100,000 in cash for a lecture, saying the money had come from Toyokawa. Shimomura has denied this. Although the jury is still out on how the country’s “moral education” is working out, it’s hard to imagine that voters condone taking money from criminals or lying while in public office. Since Oct. 1, 2011, it is also illegal to accept money of any kind from “anti-social forces” — including members of the yakuza and its associates. In the same way the government’s new education policy places importance on tradition, domestic politics has long had ties to gangsters. The LDP itself was founded with money provided by notorious underworld power broker Yoshio Kodama. Even Abe’s grandfather, former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, respected the yakuza, particularly the Yamaguchi-gumi. In 1971, Kishi paid the bail of a Yamaguchi-gumi leader who was later convicted of murder. Abe himself has been photographed in 2008 with Yamaguchi-gumi associate Icchu Nagamoto, but has denied any knowledge of the man. On the other hand, Nagamoto told his yakuza connections that he helped gather local votes for Abe to be elected top dog of the LDP in 2006, thereby ensuring Abe became prime minister in his first time at bat. That said, it’s hard to take a gangster’s words at face value. The law says that accepting money from anti-social forces, asking them to set up your political support group and supporting yakuza-backed groups is illegal. National Police Agency chief Eriko Yamatani also has a history of association with Zaitokukai, a yakuza-linked group that has been identified as being a security threat and is responsible for hate crimes. How much could and should be read into this? Abe has not apologized for the questionable connections of his handpicked Cabinet members. In fact, he has said nothing — I can’t find a record of him condemning the yakuza or those who kowtow to them. The Japanese word for this is mokunin , or admission by silence. Silence, sometimes, speaks louder than words.",

    "source": "Women's participation in elections questioned; sake labels mandatory; Tokyo bathhouses call for one-day lockout; automatic ticket gates employed <eos> 100 YEARS AGO Thursday, April 8, 1915 Women’s participation in elections questioned Women’s participation in election campaigns, which has hitherto been considered a matter of taste, is now reported to become a legal question as well. Those who disfavor the idea of any political action by the gentle sex claim that, while the police regulations, in force, forbid women’s attendance at a political meeting, it is against the spirit of the rule to acquiesce, as was done in the recent general election, by wives, mothers and daughters’ assisting in soliciting votes. If this be allowed, it is further alleged, a race of suffragists and suffragettes would grow in this country, as was done in the West, which must harm the beautiful ideals and characteristics of womanhood in Nippon. Critics will not be slow, however, to remind the lawmakers, whoever they may be, of the inconsistency of allowing women to listen to parliamentary debates and read political discussions in newspapers, books and magazines, and also of the impossibility of barring political reading at any rate. Madame Haruko Hatoyama, perhaps the real pioneer in this new field of feminine activity in Japan and the mother of a newly returned Seiyukai Representative, defends her position on a somewhat novel ground. The candidate can not attend to every detail of routine business by himself, says she, such, for instance, as the hiring of a meeting hall or the bookkeeping of campaign expenses. His relations and intimate friends, therefore, must perforce be asked to help. What she and other like-minded women did in the election campaign was, not to express political views themselves or of others, but the work of faithful messengers to convey their loved one’s wishes to the voters. This certainly does not touch the spirit of the existing police regulations, she further observes, and also is outside the question whether it is right or not for women to discuss politics. The work of pure love, done for one’s husband or son, can not possibly be represented as injurious to the traditional ideal of Japanese womanhood. 75 YEARS AGO Tuesday, April 9, 1940 Sake labels mandatory; price of beer pegged “The time has come,” the walrus said, “to speak of other things, of ships and snails and sealing wax and”… the price of beer (if you can find any) and the labelling of sake casks and bottles (if you can read the labels). All of which means the powers that be have erected another milepost in Japan’s drinking history by ordering labels pasted on sake containers and fixing the price of beer. Nothing is reported, however, on what has been done to supply the sake to go in the keg on which to paste a label or to produce the best to go in the bottle which is to sell for 70 sen a quart. The last report we had from a brave man who began a search for a bottle of beer was not reassuring. However, all we can do is report what the Chugai Shogyo says and what Domei guesses. The Chugai says, according to our translator: “All casks and bottles containing sake or Japanese wine will have labels pasted on them showing the respective contents of alcohol. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry thought of this novel method for the purpose of eliminating all watery kinds of sake and showing the purity of sake for the satisfaction of all tipplers.” Beer prices, according to Domei and Chugai, should come down, if the regulations are to be believed. All you have to do is find the beer. 50 YEARS AGO Tuesday, April 13, 1965 Tokyo bathhouses call for one-day lockout An estimated 2,500 public bathhouses in Tokyo will close Wednesday to press their demands for higher public bath charges. The public bathhouse operators will also hold a rally at Hibiya Park on Wednesday and representatives will call on Gov. Ryotaro Azuma and the Metropolitan Assembly after the rally to present their case. The association decided to close for one day because its request to the Metropolitan Government last November has not been acted upon. The bathhouse operators want to raise the charge for adults by ¥9 to ¥32, for junior high student from ¥15 to ¥25, and for primary school and younger children from ¥8 to ¥15. 25 YEARS AGO Sunday, April 22, 1990 Automatic ticket gates employed at some exits East Japan Railway Co. started using automatic ticket gates Saturday at three Yamanote Line exits at Tokyo and Komagome stations. The system records on tickets the names of passengers’ points of entry and exit, as well as the time and date the ticket was used. The service has been implemented at Tokyo Station’s Marunouchi north exit and Marunouchi underground south exit, and the east exit of Komagome Station. JR East officials expressed hope that the new system will prevent passengers from not paying the full cost of fares. The railway company estimates it loses about ¥20 billion a year in lost fares. At Tokyo Station’s Marunouchi north exit, passengers passed through the gates smoothly during the morning rush hour Saturday. But some passengers were held up because their commuter passes were incompatible with the new system. Some salaried workers complained the new system was “troublesome” because they had to remove their rail passes from the cases each time they passed through the gates. JR East plans to set up automatic ticket gates at other major stations on the Yamanote Line, such as Shinjuku, Ikebukuro and Ueno, by July. Teito Rapid Transport Authority, which runs Tokyo subways, will introduce the system at all its stations within five years.",

    "source": "Naturalized Kabukicho denizen hopes to teach China lesson in democracy <eos> Second in an occasional series on the quadrennial unified local elections. The second round will be held on April 26. Komaki Lee gained fame as a pioneering “Kabukicho guide” who showed foreign visitors the ins and outs of the capital’s seedy nightlife entertainment district in Shinjuku Ward. Now he’s going into politics. “I’m not running to become a bossy politician. . . . I’m running as just one foreign resident in Shinjuku . . . running to represent 36,000 foreigners from 121 countries living here,” Lee, 54, said in a recent interview with The Japan Times, speaking in fluent Japanese. “If people call me sensei (teacher), I will scold them.” If elected to the Shinjuku Ward Assembly on Sunday, the China-born Lee will be the first naturalized Japanese in the ward to become an assemblyman. Lee, born in China as Lee Xiaomu, became a naturalized citizen in February after spending 27 years living in Japan. His goal is to become a symbol of change in a society he regards as somewhat closed to foreigners, and to show 1.3 billion people in China what democracy truly means. The former ballet dancer and author now owns a Chinese restaurant in Kabukicho, allowing him to experience the sweet and sour of Japan from the center of the capital. He is also continuing his tour guide business, showing customers around Kabukicho’s fancy stores and restaurants as well as its cabarets, sex parlors and other shady haunts. This has given him an insider’s view on life in Japan. “After 27 years living here . . . I still see signs saying ‘foreigners and nightlife business workers OK’ when looking for an apartment in Shinjuku,” he said, noting this implies both are looked down upon in Japanese society. “You never see ‘salaryman OK’ signs, right?” This bias prompted Lee to pursue a seat on the Shinjuku assembly. Shinjuku has the largest population of foreign residents in the nation. Although 11 percent of the ward’s residents are non-Japanese, its policies predominantly reflect the Japanese perspective, Lee said. Lee’s interest in politics didn’t emerge all of a sudden. His father, a former politician, was arrested in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, leading Lee to develop a critical attitude toward the elitist nature of Chinese politics while living in Japan. Now he can somewhat appreciate Japan for being an open society — at least on a tatemae (surface) level. “(In Japan,) I could do everything my father wanted to do . . . from writing an article to publishing a book to being featured by a newspaper,” all of which he could not have accomplished in China, he said. He even used to write a monthly column for Newsweek’s Japanese edition. Now, by running for office, “I want to tell 1.3 billion people in China about what democracy is like . . . that even a foreigner-turned-Japanese who is involved in a kind of job many people look down upon on can get a chance,” he said. Lee’s first wish has come true. News that he is running for a seat in the Shinjuku assembly has generated huge buzz in China, where it was shared over 8 million times on Sina Weibo, Twitter’s counterpart in China. “They seemed to be surprised to know how I can behave freely,” he said. But Lee has a bigger goal: to improve democracy in Japan by changing the honne (true feelings) of Japanese toward foreigners entering politics. “When I tell people that I’m running for the Shinjuku assembly, even my Japanese friends expressed concern,” he said. “They seemed to be afraid that a foreigner might attain a position (that would allow him) to alter their country,” because they can’t foresee how Japan would change if led by “a foreigner.” Even harsher criticism erupted in Japanese online, Lee said. Some people began spreading rumors that he is connected with the Chinese mafia and wants to subvert Japan from inside. “But such criticism is still part of democracy — the right of expression,” he said, adding that he wants to change such prejudiced mind-sets starting from Shinjuku, a step forward to improve Japanese democracy at the local level by adding a non-Japanese perspective to the assembly. Even if he is not elected, Lee said he will accept that as a sign that Japanese democracy has yet to open its doors to non-Japanese. “My challenge won’t stop” until the day when society accepts various parties and they can live in harmony, he said.",

    "source": "On the pleasing violence of fairy tales <eos> Traditional fairy tales are so steeped in blood it’s astonishing that children didn’t all grow up to become deranged in days gone by. Take, for example, the popular Japanese fable “Shita-kiri Suzume” (literally, “Tongue-Cut Sparrow”), which tells the tale of a kind old man, his avaricious wife and an injured sparrow. Some versions of the fable end with the greedy woman being tortured to death by demons, serpents and skeletons. Horror is by no means limited to Japanese fables — it’s a universal revulsion. The original versions of fairy tales that were penned by the Brothers Grimm are full of gore. I was fortunate enough to see some of Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm’s stories in London last month as part of an immersive production based on a retelling by British writer Philip Pullman. The show included an adaptation of “The Goose Girl,” which ended with a woman — women typically bear the brunt of the punishment in fairy tales, I’m afraid — being thrown into a barrel that has spikes hammered into it. And, just in case that wasn’t gruesome enough, the barrel was then rolled down a hill. Titled “Grimm Tales,” the production was staged in a crumbling old warehouse on the south bank of the Thames, and took place across several floors. Each space was decorated with spooky things such as creepy doll’s houses and broken clocks. If you stop and think about it, it’s a bit strange that some people genuinely like being scared. Just look at the sheer number of people who flock to see horror movies at movie theaters. Fear, of course, is a vital emotion, and evolved to protect us from the very real dangers of the wild. Humans have an instinctive fear response. If your life is on the line — and it often was back in the day, when humans lived in caves and died from broken bones or something as small as a scratch — it pays to err on the side of caution. Therefore, being afraid when there’s no real apparent danger nearby — that is, watching a movie — seems to be physiologically pleasurable in some hormonal way. Greek philosopher Aristotle developed a few ideas about this. He believed that we derive pleasure from depictions of tragedy because it is cathartic. This may be true, but there’s also something to what suspense mastermind Alfred Hitchcock said in 1974: “Give them pleasure — the same pleasure they have when they wake up from a nightmare.” Fairy tales are also important from an educational perspective. Instinct does seem to feature in our fear of certain animals. There is some evidence that our propensity for fear of spiders and snakes is genetic, but there needs to be an initial trigger. When we’re born, we’re only naturally afraid of falling and of loud bangs. It’s the same with other animals — they don’t seem to be born with innate fear, rather they learn what they should and shouldn’t be afraid of. One recent and fascinating discovery on this subject concerns smell. We know that certain smells can be associated with fear if they accompany a fearful experience. However, when biologists trained mice to associate the smell of cherry blossoms — of all things! — with electric shocks, they found that even the grandchildren of the trained mice were afraid of the scent of blossoms. The fear response persisted even though the younger generation had never been shocked. Learning to be afraid of the smell of a predator or the sight of a human with a gun is one thing. However, modern society is rather more complicated than what you find in the jungle, and our fears are rather more sophisticated. Learning what humans need to be afraid of in these modern times takes rather more than a close encounter with a snake. This explains the evolution of folk tales. Before public health announcements and compulsory education system, knowledge was passed on orally. As a result, folk tales exist in all cultures. As Hideo Toguchi of Chuo University put it: “In this world of pleasure and pain, everybody is on a long journey in pursuit of happiness. Fairy tales express these symbolic dynamics of life.” Symbolism can be found in virtually all fairy tales. Sexual partners often take the form of animals. In the Pullman adaptation, an ugly frog turned into a handsome prince. In Japanese folk tales, foxes typically disguise themselves as women. Which makes me wonder. Animals don’t have fairy tales to help them learn about danger. Or do they? Some fox cubs visited my garden last year and I enjoyed watching them play. They would stalk each other and tumble around on the lawn. At a very basic level, the play-ambush teaches the cubs about the dangers of the world around them. However, it would be bit of a push to call that a fairy tale. Obviously animals don’t have an oral tradition, right? Not, at least, as we understand it. Putty-nosed monkeys in West Africa have a very basic kind of language. The monkeys make different alarm calls depending on the type of danger. If there is a leopard nearby, the monkeys emit a “pyow” call. If there is an eagle, they shout “hack.” Each call elicits a different response from the group of monkeys. A pyow call causes the monkeys to move away, while a hack cry makes them stay still and take cover. And then there’s a third option: If a monkey puts the calls together and says “pyow-hack,” it means, “Let’s move.” I like to imagine the monkeys at night telling stories to their children by making the calls. Perhaps — and there’s no evidence for this — they act out the movements and reactions piece by piece, making the younger monkeys cling to their mothers in fear while they’re remaining safe in their nests.",

    "source": "Mind the gap: Nara election reveals voter values <eos> In the wake of last Sunday’s local elections, big city political reporters were quick to see the results as (1) a mandate for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe; and (2) a disaster for the Democratic Party of Japan. The conclusions reached by those far removed from the rest of Japan — the place they sometimes visit during holidays in order to pay their respects to relatives living and deceased — are factually correct and rationally argued. But they offer little clue as to more fundamental social realities driving political choices. The real story behind this year’s local elections is, in fact, many stories. It’s a tale of the “Abe economic bubble” in (parts of) Tokyo and the gap with other regions, of public works critics in Honshu cities that enjoy mild climates and hyperconvenient transport infrastructures, and public works-friendly voters in the remote snowy mountains, forests and fields of rural Hokkaido, Shikoku and Kyushu, and of overcrowded and expensive urban centers and depopulated regions with abandoned houses. In short, the elections were about social, economic, political and even cultural and philosophical divides that will shape Japanese politics for years to come. One example of this was the Nara prefectural governor’s election. Incumbent Gov. Shogo Arai, backed by the Liberal Democratic Party and other established players, defeated Makoto Yamashita, an independent candidate. That’s all you might have read in Tokyo. The real story is that 70-year-old Arai won a closer-than-expected race against 46-year-old Yamashita, despite the former having the support of three major parties (the LDP, the DPJ and Komeito) and facing a candidate with no party support but lots of youthful energy. Arai and the old guard got a scare because a new generation of Nara residents, who often work in neighboring Osaka or Kyoto, is growing in political strength. Like Yamashita, they are younger, urban-educated and have little patience for traditional politics. Their priorities are different from those of Arai’s elderly supporters, where the motto is still “public works projects, spending on social welfare for the elderly, and agricultural protection.” Instead, they seek “economic growth,” as well as better child care, lower taxes, less bureaucracy (read: interference in their lives by bureaucrats of Arai’s generation) and decent public schools. Nara is really two prefectures in one. Northern Nara is home to the city of Nara, UNESCO treasures and a good chunk of its population. Younger residents who share Yamashita’s views are numerous. On the other hand, southern Nara contains some of Japan’s most ancient farmland, deep mountains and rugged forests. Here, younger politicians with “modern” ideas are rarely welcome. As the results showed, for the moment at least, the old guard — i.e. your grandfather’s LDP — remains on top. Not only in Nara but also in pretty much every prefecture nationwide. It’s easy to conclude that this is because there was no real choice, the DPJ and opposition parties are weak, etc. But politics is about convincing people to support you at the ballot box — out of hope or fear, and the latter is especially powerful. A best-selling book last year by the former governor of Iwate Prefecture created such fear by warning parts of Japan could go extinct as birthrates plunged, the percentage of elderly rose, and far fewer women of child-bearing age remained in the provinces. Voters in prefectures that, like Nara, were named in the book as being in danger of losing their populations thus chose safe, stable and well-known LDP candidates. Not just because of a lack of opposition, but also because, at a time of worries about depopulation and uncertainty about the future of their localities, who wants to take the risk of voting for the unknown?",

    "source": "Route to base camp blocked, scores stranded on Everest above 20,000 feet <eos> MUMBAI - Ankur Bahl, a New Delhi shipping industry specialist, was ascending Mount Everest as part of a quest to climb the world’s tallest peaks when a devastating earthquake in Nepal stranded him about 21,000 feet above sea level. Now Bahl, 54, is stuck at Camp 2, about halfway up the mountain, after the path down was blocked following avalanches, according to his wife Sangeeta, who’s trying to arrange for a helicopter evacuation. About 120 other climbers are either in Camp 1 or Camp 2 and can’t get back to base camp, she said. Failure to evacuate the remaining climbers could add to the death toll on Everest, where at least 19 people, including a Google Inc. executive have already died after Saturday’s earthquake. Many of those killed were at base camp, which was heavily damaged by boulders, snow and blocks of ice. Bahl told his wife via satellite phone on Saturday that his group of 12 climbers felt the tremors while climbing to Camp 2 from Camp 1, which has an elevation of around 20,000 feet. He hung up because the phone was low on battery, and they haven’t spoken since. Madison Mountaineering, the Seattle-based company leading Bahl’s expedition, said on its website that the climbers were safe and would attempt to reach Camp 1 for an air evacuation. The group’s medic, Marisa Eve Girawong of New Jersey, died of her injuries at base camp, it said. The route through the Khumbu Icefall that stands between Camp 1 and base camp is impassable, Garrett Madison of Madison Mountaineering wrote on the site. The group is running low on food and fuel and needs to descend, he said. “At this point our only option to get down is by helicopter evacuation,” Madison wrote. “Our plan is to descend tomorrow to Camp 1 and hopefully with good weather fly to base camp to reconnect with the other members of our expedition who survived the avalanche.” Nineteen bodies have been recovered from Everest base camp, Sitanshu Kar, a spokesman for India’s Defense Ministry, said on Twitter. More than 2,300 people have died altogether in the most powerful earthquake to hit Nepal since 1934. Bahl’s friends were trying to arrange an airlift for him via Indian military helicopters, Sangeeta said. Bahl and Sangeeta, also an avid mountaineer, are attempting to climb the highest peaks on all seven continents.",

    "source": "Iran fires warning shots, boards, seizes freighter in Strait of Hormuz <eos> DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - Iranian forces fired warning shots across the bridge of a Marshall Islands-flagged cargo vessel as it was traversing the Strait of Hormuz in Iranian territorial waters, boarded the ship and directed it toward the Iranian mainland, a Pentagon official said Tuesday. The incident, which prompted the U.S. Navy to dispatch a destroyer and a plane in response, comes as Iran and the U.S. along with other world powers try to hammer out a final deal over Tehran’s nuclear program. The master of the cargo ship MV Maersk Tigris had initially refused an Iranian order to move further into Iranian waters, but after the warning shots were fired the vessel complied, said Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman. The cargo ship, which had more than 30 people aboard, was directed to waters near Larak Island, he said. The island sits off the major Iranian port of Bandar Abbas and is one of several in the Strait of Hormuz. Iranian state television reported that only 24 crew were onboard the vessel, and hailed from Britain, Bulgaria, Romania and Myanmar. It said the ship was seized based on a court order due to unspecified violations. Iranian officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Bandar Abbas is the main port for Iran’s Navy and separate naval forces operated by the elite Revolutionary Guard, as well as the country’s primary commercial port. It overlooks the Strait of Hormuz, the highly strategic waterway at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. The strait is the route for about a fifth of the world’s oil and is only about 33 km (21 miles) wide at its narrowest point. Ships traversing the chokepoint have even less room to maneuver. The shipping lane in either direction is only 2 miles wide, with a 2-mile buffer zone between them. Iran has in the past threatened to block the strait, a move that could spark a military conflict in the Gulf. American and allied naval forces routinely patrol the strait and have conducted military drills aimed at countering threats such as sea mines that Iran might use to close the waterway. Tehran frequently conducts military exercises of its own in and around the strait. Large-scale, live-fire naval drills in February saw Revolutionary Guard forces assault a replica of a U.S. aircraft carrier built in a Bandar Abbas shipyard. “It is inappropriate” for the Iranians to have fired warning shots across the ship’s bridge in Tuesday’s circumstances, Warren said. He said it was too early to know whether the Iranian intervention amounted to a violation of the freedom of navigation through a waterway heavily used by international shipping. Warren said the cargo ship had been boarded by Iranians, but no one was injured and no Americans were involved. The spokesman said the U.S. government has “certain obligations” to defend the interests of the Marshall Islands, but he was uncertain how those obligations to the Pacific Ocean nation apply in this situation. The Iranian vessels, numbering five or six, were with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy, he said. The incident began at about 4:05 a.m. U.S. Eastern Daylight Time, he said. After the cargo ship sent a distre6ss call, the U.S. Navy sent the destroyer USS Farragut and a Navy maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft to the area of the incident to monitor the situation, according to Warren. Lt. Joseph Hontz, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet in Bahrain, which oversees American maritime operations in the region, declined comment further on the incident and referred queries to the Pentagon. Maersk, based in Copenhagen, said the ship was chartered to Rickmers Ship Management, based in Hamburg, Germany. Maersk said it had no information about the crew or the cargo. Sabina Pech, a Rickmers spokeswoman in Hamburg, said she was aware of the incident but had no information and could not comment. In 2007, Revolutionary Guard forces captured 15 British sailors and marines from a frigate in the Gulf, accusing them of operating in Iranian waters. They were released less than two weeks later.",

    "source": "In China, knock-off Apple Watches have their own fans <eos> SHENZHEN, / HONG KONG - Lining the glass display cases of Shenzhen’s giant tech malls, knockoff versions of Apple Inc’s smartwatch were on sale at many stalls, with some Chinese consumers eager to snap them up for a fraction of the cost of the original. “It came on sale in mid-March and has been constantly out of stock,” said one imitation-Apple Watch seller who declined to give his name. “On average we sell around 40 a day. Some customers just came and bought five or more at a time.” The watches, built on Google Inc’s operating system, do not need a separate smartphone to work, said one merchant. At her store, one was retailing for 360 yuan ($58) — around one eighth of the cost of Apple’s cheaper Watch models. One version used a SIM card, could make calls, send messages, browse the Internet and take pictures, she said. In Hong Kong, the official Apple Store preview of the Watch was quiet. No queues stretched down the street as they normally do for Apple product launches. A handful of people waited at the door, outnumbered by Apple staff whose cheers lasted a handful of seconds. Most of the shoppers from mainland China, who commonly cross the border to pick up the latest Apple must-have, were there for other gadgets. “I’m here to buy an iPad,” said a shopper from the southwestern city of Chongqing, who gave her surname as Jian. “I will take a look at the Watch later . . . none of my friends have talked about the Watch back home.” But the technology bazaars in the southern Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen were chaotic on Thursday. Merchants hawked their goods to Chinese and foreign shoppers, showing off different smartwatches’ various colors and models. Some were unimpressed with the imitation Apple Watches. “I really want to buy the original one,” said Vikram Jan, an Indian businessman from New Delhi shopping in Shenzhen. “The fake one is really bad.” Though the knockoffs have their admirers, some merchants are doubtful about the impact on genuine Apple Watch sales. “You know some want the real thing and some just want to go for the cheaper option,” said the woman selling knock-off watches. “There are all kinds of customers and people who want the cheaper one would still buy our product.”",

    "source": "For foreign caregivers, role remains ambiguous <eos> Does Japan really want to accept foreign caregivers? This question, which has dogged the rapidly graying nation for years, continues to loom over a government program to bring in caregivers under bilateral economic partnership agreements. Japan opened its doors to foreign care workers in 2008, when, via an EPA with Indonesia, it accepted 104 people to work in the nation’s nursing homes to assist the elderly. Subsequent EPAs with the Philippines and Vietnam paved the way for the start in 2009 and 2014, respectively, of similar programs, through which a total of 1,500 caregivers have so far been accepted. But the government doggedly has maintained that these caregivers were brought in to “strengthen economic cooperation” under the free trade deals, not to fill manpower shortages in the nursing care sector. As such, their raison d’etre in Japan has always been ambiguous, experts say. Yasuhiro Yuki, professor of welfare policy at Shukutoku University in Chiba Prefecture, says care facility operators had wrongly expected them to stay in Japan indefinitely, when the system was simply not designed that way. “I think the caregivers have succeeded in serving the original purpose of personnel exchange,” Yuki said. “But care facility operators in Japan had hoped they would stay on as care workers. . . . They never understood that the government accepted the workers in exchange for lower tariffs on cars and bananas.” EPA caregivers, despite being licensed as nurses back home, must pass the state qualification exam in Japan to be licensed as kaigo fukushi shi (nursing care specialists) at the end of the four-year EPA program in Japan, if they hope to continue working thereafter. Every year, only around half of the EPA workers who take the exam — which is held only in Japanese — pass. If they do, they are allowed to stay and their visas are renewable, but those who fail are sent back home. In response to criticism that the exam’s hurdles are unrealistically and unnecessarily high, the government has tweaked the test, attaching hiragana to all the kanji, introducing a little bit of English and extending the test time for EPA applicants. Also, since 2012, the government has given a second chance to those who fail the exam, out of “diplomatic consideration,” according to the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry. Instead of being immediately repatriated, EPA caregivers can now stay in Japan for one more year to prepare for a second chance at the exam “as an exceptional measure.” But even then, more than a third of those who pass anyway go home, according to the labor ministry. Yuki, who got involved in the one-year, pre-arrival training program for Vietnamese caregivers at the request of the Foreign Ministry, said foreign applicants mostly see their stint in Japan as a high-paying job that lasts just a few years, after which they can return home and easily find jobs as translators or tour guides for Japanese visitors and businesses, using the language ability acquired under the EPA program. This, Yuki said, has left nursing care facility operators disenchanted, especially since the majority of the workers have been highly motivated and proved themselves to be valuable staff at care homes. Yas Idei, a journalist who has covered foreign labor issues extensively, called the EPA program a failure. “The government accepted people under EPAs without making it clear whether it wants to welcome foreign caregivers (as a long-term source of labor),” he said. “The minor tweaks of the qualification exam might have helped a few dozen others pass it, but that gives no impact on the gap in the labor market, where the government says Japan will be short 300,000 caregivers by 2025.” Idei said the government intentionally set the hurdle too high for EPA workers to discourage them from settling in Japan, noting that 3 in 4 Japanese working at care facilities don’t have the same state qualification. According to Idei, Japan needs to have a serious debate about how many of the 300,000 care-worker slots it wants to fill with non-Japanese, now that two new systems for bringing in foreign caregivers — through the technical training program and a new visa status for such professionals — are being planned. Germany and some other European countries are also trying to recruit Asian caregivers, with their governments investing heavily in language education, Idei said, noting that, in contrast, Taiwan has imported some 200,000 caregivers as cheap labor, forsaking quality over quantity. “First, Japan needs to decide if it wants to accept caregivers. If it does, the country should also discuss how to make itself an appealing labor market for them, ditching the self-conceited idea that simply by opening doors, good talent will flow in,” he said.",

    "source": "Unlike elections, referendums are a PR free-for-all <eos> With less than three weeks until the May 17 referendum on whether to consolidate the city of Osaka into five semi-autonomous wards, supporters and opponents of the plan are engaged in an intense and unprecedented media and public relations campaign to win over voters. Unlike elections, where campaigning methods are strictly controlled, there is a remarkable degree of freedom on all sides to debate, and propagate, their message during a referendum campaign. What kind of freedom? First, you’re allowed to drum up support for your position before the official campaign period begins, and you can even harangue potential voters on the day of the referendum. Second, there are no limits on the amount each side can spend to promote its views. Third, political parties do not face detailed rules on the design and number of posters and pamphlets they can print up and pass out advocating their position. Finally, candidates for public office face restrictions on TV commercials. Their messages are about the political party’s activities, not the individual. But there are no real restrictions on TV commercials for a referendum. All of this means that supporters and opponents in the Osaka merger referendum have, in theory at least, unprecedented opportunities to get their messages out via the media and other public relations activities. For Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto and his Osaka Ishin no Kai (One Osaka) political group, this means directly appealing to voters for support. Over a 12-day period this month, Hashimoto barnstormed the city, holding three town meetings a day lasting about two hours in all of Osaka’s 24 wards. A downloadable pamphlet from the city’s website explains the plan and has been sent to all Osaka residents by mail and was distributed at the town meetings. All major parties opposed to the plan have drawn up their own pamphlets and materials as well. Both are now flooding social media with their views in ways never seen in election campaigns. None of this comes cheap. Osaka Ishin is expected to spend from ¥400 million to ¥500 million on the referendum blitz, while the local segment of the Liberal Democratic Party, which opposes the merger, will invest tens of millions of yen to counter him. Who’s winning the PR war? As of late April, it appears to be the anti-merger camp. Voters and some media are expressing irritation with the way Hashimoto ran the town meetings, sometimes limiting question time. Local media polls in mid-April showed opposition eclipsing support, a reversal of the situation in March. But with fewer limits on campaigning, Osakans are likely to see a very different blitz in the coming days than the usual campaigns, where white-gloved candidates do nothing but shout their name at passers-by. That could be a good thing, as it means more direct and detailed appeals from both sides, helping to ensure participation on May 17 is well above voter turnout rates for elections.",

    "source": "Cycling the Kyoto maze could get easier <eos> Kyoto’s historical and cultural treasures have always attracted large numbers of tourists. But getting around the city by car or bus has never been easy, even when traffic is light. Train and subway stations are somewhat limited and not always near the most visited historical sites. Narrow one-way streets abound, and even the main roads are often clogged with vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Long-term residents give directions by joking that your destination is a 10-minute walk or a 30-minute taxi or bus ride away. That makes bicycles particularly popular. After Tokyo and Osaka, Kyoto, with a population of about 1.5 million to Osaka’s 2.7 million, has more people commuting to work or school by bicycle than any other city in the country. Yet that creates its own problems. For many years, bicycle use in Kyoto was loosely regulated and parking, as with autos, was a huge headache. People lined up their bikes, illegally, in long rows that took up half the sidewalk, squeezing foot traffic into a narrow area and making a stroll downtown difficult for those whose natural speed is faster than a turtle. But at the end of March, Kyoto announced plans to make the city more cyclist-friendly by 2020. More money will be spent on adding bicycle lanes, improving public knowledge of safety issues, building parking spaces and working with the private sector to expand bike tours. While some Kyoto roads now have bicycle lanes, there are plans afoot to create new routes in three parts of the city, including virtually its entire center, by 2020. The lanes will be marked with pictographs, not kanji. Efforts to make Kyoto more cyclist-friendly actually began in earnest in 2010, when more than 86,000 illegally parked bicycles were removed by the city. New measures increased the number of private parking lot owners, and there is now authorized parking space to accommodate over 54,000 bicycles, up from about 49,000 in 2010 and 39,000 a decade ago. At the same time, crackdowns on illegal parking meant the city removed just over 54,600 bikes in fiscal 2013, especially from the banks of the Kamo River and city streets late at night, on weekends and holidays. Progress has thus been visible even with the number of tourists on the streets rising rapidly. The latest available figures, from fiscal 2013, show more than 51.6 million tourists visited Kyoto. That includes over 1.1 million foreigners who spent at least one night in Kyoto — a 35 percent increase over the previous year. While fleets of air-conditioned buses with guides speaking nonstop through a public address system the entire tour still shepherd large groups around, not a few foreign tourists, especially from the United States and Europe, prefer to travel individually or in small groups by bicycle. Over the past decade or so, some long-term Kyoto expats have begun to offer bicycle tours of the major temples, shrines and historic sites, or provide English-language information on where, and how, to get around Kyoto on two wheels. While generally agreeing the city is better today than a couple of decades ago when it comes to its bicycle policy, several people have offered specific advice on how to create an even more-cyclist friendly environment. Chris Rowthorn, author of Lonely Planet’s Japan and Kyoto guides, runs his own tour company. He says that while Kyoto is one of the most bikeable cities in Asia, it doesn’t make it easy, particularly foreign cyclists who cannot read Japanese. “The city’s main bicycle parking lots, including the new ones on Oike dori (Oike Avenue, directly across from Kyoto City Hall), lack English-language explanations on the payment machines,” he said. And parking, he says, remains a problem. “There is an acute shortage of places to park bicycles in the city. Kyoto is assiduous about removing bicycles parked on city streets, but much less concerned about building bicycle parking lots or spaces and making them easy to use for foreign visitors,” he said. Sanborn Brown, who created the CycleKyoto.com website, a bilingual reference for tourists, commuters, first-time visitors and long-time residents, offered a half dozen suggestions on what might be done over the coming years. “As much as possible, the city needs to separate cars, bikes and pedestrians. A citywide rental system, like Velib in Paris, would be nice. It would require multiple pickup and drop-off ports, ease of use (read: multilingual instructions) and payment for non-Japanese speakers,” Brown said. Many of the above suggestions have been incorporated into the 2020 plan announced by the city last month. With the Tokyo Olympics that same year, Kyoto’s politicians and merchants are looking forward to greeting large numbers of visitors and making sure they get around smoothly. But given the reliance of Kyoto’s tourism industry on large group tours, taking the kind of additional cyclist-friendly measures seen in some overseas cities could be tough. “The number of cars and tour buses on the road should be reduced if the city really wants to make it safe for cyclists and pedestrians, though this is not likely to happen,” Brown said.",

    "source": "Taco Bell returns to Japan with launch of Shibuya outlet <eos> What’s the same: that iconic bell sign, friendly and casual staff, and a range of crunchy and soft tacos and burritos. What’s different: a real live yuru-kyara mascot greeting customers, a couple of localized dishes, and prices double or triple those in the United States. U.S. fast food chain Taco Bell Corp. made a much-hyped re-entry into the Japanese market on Tuesday, opening a store in Tokyo’s Shibuya Ward through Asrapport Dining Co., a Japanese operator of restaurant franchises. The U.S. restaurant chain, known for its Mexican-inspired menu, operated restaurants in Japan in the late 1980s but later pulled out, with the exception of outlets at U.S. military bases, which remained. On Tuesday morning, Taco Bell aficionados were out in force, lining up before the doors opened. At 10 a.m., as bells rang, an English-speaking staffer and the mascot, named Taco Man, led customers in one by one. “We came here because we wanted to be the first,” said California native Jason Stillwell, a 37-year-old English teacher from Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture. He arrived at the store at 7:30 a.m. to be among the first 100 patrons to get a free taco and a T-shirt. “I have a friend who’s a Taco Bell manager back home. So I emailed her and said ‘We have a Taco Bell in Japan too!’ ” The chain’s foray into Japan comes at a time when a handful of U.S. dining chains, including Carl’s Jr. and Shake Shack, are planning to enter the Japanese market, aiming to attract not just domestic customers but also increasing numbers of foreign visitors ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Melissa Lora, president of Taco Bell International, is optimistic that the firm’s second crack at the nation’s ¥24 trillion restaurant market will succeed, stressing the market environment is better than in the late 1980s. “The world has changed,” Lora said. “Back then, no one took pictures of the food. With social media and all the focus on new, interesting foods that are in the world today, we feel now is the perfect time to come into Japan.” Keiko Takasaki, 29, who came with a friend, was among many customers who learned of the store’s opening through Facebook. “I enjoyed Taco Bell in California, where I used to live,” she said. She was looking forward to Japan-only dishes such as shrimp avocado burrito and taco rice. Unfortunately, prices will also be Japanese-style: Most dishes cost ¥500 or ¥600, with the cheapest taco on the menu — a beef crunchy taco — priced at ¥270. Asrapport Dining official Mike Morizumi said the higher prices were inevitable due to the yen’s rapid depreciation over the past two years and because the restaurant chain sees little benefit from economies of scale in Japan at the moment, with just one location. The firm aims to open 15 outlets nationwide within five years, he said. Some customers said the prices might be too stiff. “Taco Bell in America is famous for cheap tacos,” Stillwell said. “If they cost ¥200 or ¥300, it would be (the same as) a regular restaurant.”",

    "source": "Under 'Abenomics,' rich thrive but middle class on precipice <eos> This is the third story of a four-part series on evaluating Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s namesake economic program, backed by the aggressive monetary-easing by the Bank of Japan. The recent debate over wealth inequality has highlighted an unpleasant fact for policymakers — that the income gap between rich and poor is not shrinking, even though Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic policies have been in play for two years now. Ever since the translated version of French economist Thomas Piketty’s best-selling book “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” was published in Japan in December, academics have closely scrutinized “Abenomics” and its results. What became clear was that in a society long dominated by families of moderate means — the top 1 percent of wealthy people account for a mere 10 percent of overall incomes — Japan’s middle class is now facing an existential crisis. According to Akio Doteuchi, a senior researcher at the NLI Research Institute, what is threatening people here is that, under the current social structure, virtually anyone in the middle class is at risk of falling into poverty. “It’s like walking in a mine field. Many risks lie ahead of you,” Doteuchi said. “Even if you are in the middle class, if something unexpected happens, you could slip into poverty.” Such risks could include contracting diseases such as cancer and being unable to work, the failure to land a job soon after graduation, or an ill parent who needs looking after. The big problem in Japan is that there are few social safety nets for such situations. In the past, workers had been shielded by the guarantee of lifetime employment at companies. When they retired, they were supported by family members, Doteuchi noted. But now, there is an increasing number of nonregular workers, particularly younger ones, whose financial situations are unstable. More and more single-person households are vulnerable to serious health problems. Data back this up. According to labor ministry figures announced April 1, the number of households living on welfare hit a record 1,618,817 in January. This figure has been on the rise for the last two decades. The country’s relative poverty rate has also edged up over the last 30 years, especially with single mothers and fathers raising children, although the latest data are for 2012. On the other hand, data also show that the rich became even wealthier under Abe’s tenure. Their numbers and the amount of their assets surged in 2013 and are still rising mostly due to sharp gains in stocks triggered by the Bank of Japan’s aggressive monetary easing, which started in April 2013, experts said. According to the Nomura Research Institute, the number of wealthy households jumped 24.3 percent, with the amount of their total financial assets rising 28.2 percent in 2013, compared with 2011 figures. And as the stock market uptick continues, so too will the number of wealthy people grow. “Since stocks account for a larger portion of their assets, both the number of wealthy people and their assets are on the rise,” said Hiroyuki Miyamoto, general manager of Nomura Institute’s financial business consulting department. Households on average are believed to have a majority of their assets either in bank accounts or in cash. But the wealthy hold risk assets such as real estate, stocks and bonds — assets more likely to grow in value faster than mere savings accounts, Miyamoto said. But at the same time, the wealthy in Japan are less dominant in terms of overall assets when compared with the rich in the U.S., partly because income levels of top corporate leaders are not as high as those in the U.S. and the tax system levies heavier income taxes on wealthy people than in many other countries, he said. Experts have said the widening gap between haves and have-nots could be an economic driver when a country is rapidly growing. However, once it matures, any wide disparity can hamper economic growth, NLI’s Doteuchi said. Then what policies will help shrink the gap? The first thing the country needs to do is to help young people find stable employment, he said. “Abenomics has boasted economic strength, telling people that higher economic growth will shrink the gap between the haves and have-nots via the trickledown effect,” Doteuchi said. “But is that really true? I think not. Solving inequality is the way to improve the economy.”",

    "source": "Tokyo's Ueno Park blossoms as tourist site <eos> Ueno Park, one of Tokyo’s best-known landmarks, is Japan’s first government-designated park, with its origins dating back to the Meiji Era. It was Dutch military Dr. Anthonius Franciscus Bauduin (1820-1885) who first proposed the idea of giving the area special status. At this time of year, hundreds of cherry trees in full bloom add a seasonal color to Ueno Park. Visitors can enjoy illuminated blossoms between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. until April 12 during the Ueno Sakura Matsuri. Japan’s love of sakura (cherry blossoms) is strong. Even in this high-tech era, hanami (cherry blossom viewing) parties under the trees remain popular. In fact, it is not an uncommon sight these days to see foreign tourists also joining in the action. The percentage of tourists, especially those from other parts of Asia, has shot up in recent years. Walking south from JR Ueno Station, you will find the famed Ameyoko shopping arcade, with some 400 shops tightly lining a 400-meter-long stretch. The arcade began as a black market in the ashes of the war, dealing in American goods obtained from Occupation forces. In recent years, food stalls selling dishes from China, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Turkey and other parts of Asian are gaining more prominence, giving the shopping arcade a global diversity. Various ethnic foods are also available on the underground floor of Ameyoko Center Building. Foreign tourists with knowledge of the area come to the floor to buy the ingredients for dishes from their homelands. Despite its origin as the downtown area of Edo, today’s Ueno has everything from natural beauty to international diversity. Easy access from Tokyo Station and Narita Airport also add to its popularity.",

    "source": "Foreign visitors top 1.5 million to break March record <eos> Tourist arrivals to Japan topped 1.5 million to break a March record this year as Chinese travelers flocked to the country for cherry blossom season, new figures released Wednesday show. The rise in arrivals to 1.526 million, up 45.3 percent from a year earlier, was also attributed to the weaker yen and expansion of consumption-tax-free products for foreign tourists since October, the Japan National Tourism Organization said. “Japan is now enjoying popularity among foreign tourists with visitors from all countries equally increasing,” said Japan Tourism Agency chief Shigeto Kubo. By country and region, China accounted for the largest share of the total at 338,200 people, up 83.7 percent, followed by Taiwan at 277,900, up 33.2 percent, and South Korea at 268,200, up 39.6 percent, according to the JNTO. The upward trend also extended to European travelers with a record number of British and German tourists in March at 25,200 and 18,400, respectively, in what was attributed at an earlier Easter holiday period. The number of visitors from the Philippines more than doubled to 26,800 from the previous year. According to the JNTO, the number of visitors to Japan between January and March was 4.13 million, up 43.7 percent from the previous year. If the trend continued, international tourist numbers were likely to top 16 million this year. “Foreigners are drawn by public safety, healthy food and rural landscapes that are specific to Japan,” said Shinichi Shimizu, who teaches tourism at the Rikkyo University. Japan also saw a growing trend with Chinese tourists flooding Japan’s most popular cherry blossom viewing spots. JTB Corp., a major travel agency, said the number of inquiries from Chinese tourists had increased after the company started offering cherry blossom tours in English, Chinese, Korean and Thai. Japan is hoping to boost tourist numbers with the government setting a target of 20 million tourists by 2020, when Tokyo hosts the Olympics Games. But industry watchers fear the number could drop after the event. The key, they say, is to raise tourist satisfaction levels by offering services in multiple foreign languages. “To lure foreigners to the countryside and to increase repeat visits, local municipalities need to rediscover what is unique to their region and map out a long-term city plan,” Shimizu said.",

    "source": "Cash shortfall among the elderly could push Japan over the edge <eos> Last summer the welfare ministry reported that a record number of households were receiving government assistance, and 47.1 percent of these households were made up of either elderly people only or the elderly and unmarried family members under 18. The media has been reporting for years that an increasing number of seniors are joining the welfare rolls. National pensions were never meant to cover every retiree’s living expenses, but it’s obvious that many are not prepared for their old age. How much do you need to save in order to guarantee a comfortable life when you retire? The anonymous 30-year-old who writes the popular investment blog Setsuyaku Toshi no Susume recently wondered the same thing when he realized his parents would be broke by the time they retired. He will support them in their old age, but he doesn’t want to be a “burden on my own children.” He cites a 2013 survey by the Japan Institute of Life Insurance, who questioned more than 4,000 married couples about their retirement plans. One-third of the respondents said they needed “at least” between ¥200,000 and ¥250,000, and another third answered between ¥250,000 and ¥400,000. Only 5 percent thought they could make it on less than ¥150,000, and 1.7 percent couldn’t do with less than ¥400,000. The average for all responses was ¥220,000. Then JILI asked the same people how much money they needed for a “comfortable” life. The average for all responses came to ¥354,000, or ¥134,000 more than the minimum they said they required. How does that stack up to reality? According to a study carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications last year, the average expenditure of a hypothetical couple whose husband is over 65 and whose wife is over 60, neither of whom work, was ¥239,485, down from ¥242,598 in 2013. After subtracting taxes and insurance, this couple’s income came to ¥177,925 for 2014, down from ¥185,006 in 2013. That means they needed to find an extra ¥62,560 a month, which is ¥4,968 more than they needed in 2013. Things are tougher for single retirees over 60, who in 2014 needed on average ¥41,516 a month extra to make ends meet. Based on current longevity statistics, the model couple’s husband should live to be 80 and the wife 87. Under those circumstances, they would need, over the years, ¥18.5 million more than their income just to survive, and that figure doesn’t take into consideration probable changes in pension outlays or retirement age. Since these figures are averages, some have it easier and some harder. The ministry calculates that the average expenditure for housing by the aforementioned couple was ¥16,158 a month in 2014. Many retired couples own their homes outright, but others are either still paying off loans or renting. Also, average income decreased between 2013 and 2014. More specifically, the couple’s total pension-derived income went from ¥200,309 to ¥190,800. For a single senior it went from ¥114,415 to ¥103,767. At the high end of the pension spectrum are couples where the husband was enrolled in the company-sponsored kōsei nenkin system and also receives a basic pension ( kiso nenkin ), while the wife, as a full-time homemaker, qualified as a “No. 3” national pension subscriber, and thus receives her own basic pension. Such a couple could receive up to ¥230,000 a month in pension payments when they reach retirement age. But most seniors don’t fit that model. First, the retiree has to have paid into the system his or her whole working life to receive the maximum amount. Second, people whose employers didn’t belong to the kōsei nenkin system only receive the basic pension — but only if they have paid into it for at least 25 years, regardless of whether or not they worked. The basic pension maxes out at ¥70,000 if you’ve paid at least 40 years, but many people haven’t. Ever since employment practices were deregulated in the ’90s, more workers have been designated as nonregular employees, which means they don’t have to belong to the kosei nenkin system. They still have to pay into the basic pension system, but many don’t, because they can’t afford the fixed premiums. Since the retiring boomer generation is large and a good portion has managed to save, it may not be a big problem in the short run, but if all of them tap into their savings at the same time, it could have an effect on the national debt. Banks use that enormous savings pool to buy Japanese government bonds, which keeps the government afloat. The current pension system was designed for a different economic climate. Basic pensions were meant for self-employed people, who could sell or live off their businesses when they retired. They weren’t meant for part-timers or contract workers, who tend to live from hand to mouth.",

    "source": "Get up high to see how the past has shaped present-day Tokyo <eos> Tokyo spreads out from the Imperial Palace in Chiyoda Ward like a massive concrete jungle. Though the numerous skyscrapers can be impressive during the day, at night the lights come on and the metropolis really begins to sparkle. Unlike many capitals, which feature myriad heritage buildings, the city has almost no buildings that are older than a century. Deanna MacDonald, an architectural historian and co-author of the book “New Japan Architecture,” says that in Tokyo “it is still financially and culturally more common to demolish and rebuild. In Japan, half of all houses are demolished before 38 years (compared to 100 years in the United States).” The average life span for a building in Tokyo is even shorter — about 30 years, according to the Housing and Land Survey by the Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. Despite fast changes in the skyline, however, it’s still possible to hear an echo of the past: streets twisted in impossible directions, the occasional downtown cemetery and, of course, the temples and shrines. These features tell the story of Edo, the former name for the capital, and make the futuristic characteristics of Shinjuku and Shibuya stand out even more. One of the best ways to see any city is from above, and Tokyo has a number of spots that will let you do this free of charge. The most well-known and easy to access is the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building. Each of its two towers has an observation deck that offers a good view of Shinjuku’s skyscraper district. The building closes late, so head there for sunset to get a possible glimpse of Mount Fuji. A view of the Tokyo skyline and Mount Fuji is also a trademark of the Bunkyo Civic Center Observation Deck. It’s hard to see the mountain on most days because of haze, but Golden Week offers your best shot at a glimpse due to the reduction in traffic.",

    "source": "Japanese Red Cross opening in Paris; Tokyo inns to ban rice; U.S. nuclear submarine arrives; Emperor regrets colonial 'sufferings' <eos> 100 YEARS AGO Saturday, May 15, 1915 Japanese Red Cross opening in Paris The opening of the new Japanese Red Cross hospital in Paris took place on April 3, a Japanese national holiday. The presence of M. Gerard, former Ambassador to Tokyo, attracted attention at the event. As the Japanese nurses were already engaged in their work, only two were present. The director of the Military Health Bureau paid a tribute to them for their diligence. There are provided at the new facility 150 beds, of which 128 are already occupied by wounded French soldiers (who are engaged in fighting with German forces). Most are serious cases. The work of our sisters is really appreciated by the French, but it is to be regretted that their knowledge of the language is very poor. 75 YEARS AGO Wednesday, May 15, 1940 Tokyo inns to ban rice, serve bread at lunch Along with the government’s policy of economizing on rice, native-style hotels and inns throughout Tokyo will adopt bread and Western-style meals for their guests from now on, according to the Yomiuri. This plan received the unanimous approval of innkeepers in the metropolis, who gathered together during a general meeting of the Tokyo Inn (Ryokan) Association. Members at the meeting cited examples where guests complained of inferior rice being served on the hotel menus. For example, a guest would eat fairy white rice at one inn, but get a much poorer grade at another inn in the neighboring district. This was the result of uneven distribution of rice to the different inns. In other words, the inns that were unfortunate enough to receive rice at the bottom of the sack, or rice that had been laid up in the storehouses, were inclined to be of a dirtier color than the rice at the top, although there was supposedly no difference in quality. Innkeepers remarked that they were tired of hearing complaints and adopting bread for noon-day lunches would be in keeping with the national “rice-saving” policy at the same time. It is estimated that at least 50 bushels of rice will be saved per day if all the inns in Tokyo adopt this new plan. 50 YEARS AGO Wednesday, May 26, 1965 U.S. nuclear submarine arrives in Sasebo The U.S. nuclear-powered submarine Snook entered the northern Kyushu port of Sasebo Tuesday morning to meet a rather quiet reception by demonstrators. In Tokyo, however, seven Zengakuren students had to be arrested after an hour-and-half-long scuffle between riot police and 250 militant, stone-throwing students. About 500 demonstrators, mostly unionists and members of the Japan Socialist Party and the Japan Communist Party, marched near the U.S. Sasebo base during the morning. They were joined by 200 more in the afternoon. About 600 police officers formed a strong picket in front of the demonstrators on the street leading to the Snook’s landing pier. Unable to break through the police, the demonstrators made a detour to the Sasebo waterfront, where they lined up and shouted, “Go home, nuclear sub,” for the rest of the day. In Tokyo, militant members of the National Federation of Students Self-Government Associations (Zengakuren) attempted to storm the Foreign Office to protest the visit. The students, all members of the anti-JCP faction of Zengakuren, first tangled with about 200 steel-helmeted riot police in front of the Foreign Office. As they were pushed back, the students sat down on the pavement outside, chanting, “Go home, nuclear submarine.” The submarine, according to U.S. naval authorities, visited the port for rest and recreation purposes. It will also take on necessary supplies during its stay here. 25 YEARS AGO Friday, May 25, 1990 Colonial ‘sufferings’ regretted by Emperor The Emperor expressed his “deepest regret” Thursday over the “sufferings” Koreans experienced during Japan’s colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 until the end of World War II. Addressing an Imperial Palace banquet for the visiting South Korean president, Roh Tae Woo, the Emperor said, “I think of the sufferings your people underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought about by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret.” The Emperor’s statement was apparently aimed at putting an end to the longstanding dispute between the two countries over South Korea’s demand for a “clear-cut apology” by the Emperor for the brutalities Japan inflicted on Koreans for 36 years. The governments of both Seoul and Tokyo share the perception that without resolving the so-called apology issue, the two countries can not make a fresh start on bilateral relations, Japanese officials said. Citing a statement made by the late Emperor Showa in 1984, the Emperor said the “unfortunate past … should not be repeated again.” He expressed hope that Japan and South Korea will deepen their mutual understanding and that a “new friendship will be the groundwork for the two countries to join forces in making a significant contribution to the future of mankind.” Roh replied that “historical facts” regarding bilateral relations cannot be erased. But he added that the two nations must not remain “bound up in memories.” Japan and South Korea, Roh went on to say, “must now forge a new era of friendship and cooperation,” putting the “mistakes of the past truly behind us.”",

    "source": "Chief Cabinet secretary is much more than top government spokesman <eos> Which politician is most often quoted by Japanese media outlets? The answer undoubtedly is the chief Cabinet secretary, who holds two news conferences each weekday. But fielding questions from reporters is just a small part of the job. What are the official and unofficial duties? What’s the source of the top government spokesman’s power? Below are some questions and answers about the linchpin of the Cabinet. What role does the chief Cabinet secretary play? The holder of that title presides over the Cabinet Secretariat, the staff at the prime minister’s office. The post basically goes to someone who is close to and can serve as the right-hand man to the prime minister. The chief Cabinet secretary’s clout has increased greatly since the late 1990s, when late Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto reorganized the ministries and strengthened the power of the prime minister. Before then, few politicians and only a small number of bureaucrats routinely spent time at the prime minister’s office. Elite bureaucrats at each ministry exerted great influence over government decision-making; the prime minister and chief Cabinet secretary had relatively limited power. But facing a financial crisis in the 1990s, the government needed to carry out drastic reforms, and purge the ministries of vested interests. In the process, the power and functions of the prime minister’s office were strengthened, as was that of the chief Cabinet secretary, who took on the role of coordinating the policies of all the ministries and agencies. The chief Cabinet secretary also came to preside over key advisory panels, administrative organizations and high-ranking officials, including the deputy chief Cabinet secretary for crisis management, the National Security Secretariat, the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office, and the Cabinet Affairs Office. What are the official duties of the chief Cabinet secretary? The most well-known job is to hold a news conference twice a day and present the official views of the government in response to questions from reporters. Every weekday morning, assistants to the chief Cabinet secretary check the major newspapers and TV news broadcasts, and prepare official comments on major topics about which reporters might ask questions during news conferences. The chief Cabinet secretary then faces reporters with a file of official views prepared by the assistants, and offers comments based on that file, with occasional additional commentary if deemed necessary. The morning news conference usually starts at 9:40 a.m. Tuesday and Friday, and at 11 a.m. on other weekdays. The afternoon news conference usually starts at 4 p.m. Those news conferences, once open only to reporters from major newspapers and TV stations, can be viewed live over the Internet. The second major job of the chief Cabinet secretary is to coordinate the policies of ministries and make top-down political decisions when necessary. When the prime minister engages in diplomacy and crisis management, the chief Cabinet secretary may exert great influence over diplomacy as well, as Yoshihide Suga currently does. For example, Suga is regarded as a key player in coordinating the conflicting policies and interests of the trade and agriculture ministries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade talks. What other roles does the chief Cabinet secretary play? The chief Cabinet secretary usually also serves as a policy coordinator and communicator between the ruling party and the prime minister. If the policies of the ruling party and the government conflict, the chief Cabinet secretary often engages in behind-the-scenes talks to bring the opposing views closer together. The chief Cabinet secretary also has access to and can freely use a special fund at the Cabinet Secretariat that amounts to around ¥1.4 billion every year, and does not have to disclose details of any expenses. The fund has often invited allegations that it has been used for shady political machinations, including bribing politicians and political commentators. Who is the current chief Cabinet secretary? Born in Akita in 1948, Suga started his political career as a secretary to a Lower House member. After serving as a Yokohama Municipal Assembly member, he was elected to the Lower House in 1996. Suga is a longtime ally of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and was appointed internal affairs minister in 2006 during Abe’s first stint as prime minister. Even after Abe quit that post in 2007, citing health reasons, Suga maintained close ties with him and apparently earned his trust. Suga is also one of the key figures who urged Abe to run again for the Liberal Democratic Party presidency in 2012, helping to ensure his comeback as prime minister. What is Suga’s governing style like? Suga often wields clout over bureaucrats and keeps them in check on Abe’s behalf. He routinely intervenes in the administrative process, appointing favored candidates as key ranking bureaucrats. Suga is believed to have played a major role in the appointments of Haruhiko Kuroda as Bank of Japan governor and Katsuto Momii as NHK president. Suga also created the Cabinet Bureau of Personnel Affairs, which serves as the secretariat for the prime minister to select who serves as an elite bureaucrat. There are about 600 such positions across government ministries and agencies, including vice ministers and bureau chiefs.",

    "source": "Nuclear remains cheapest power source despite Fukushima meltdowns: government <eos> A panel of nuclear experts on Monday largely approved a government report saying that atomic power remains the cheapest source of electricity despite the rising safety costs triggered by the 2011 Fukushima core meltdowns. Despite an expected glut in solar power, the government is looking to make nuclear power account for 20 to 22 percent of Japan’s electricity supply by 2030, underscoring its policy of sticking with atomic power even though the majority of the public remains opposed to restarting its idled reactors. According to the latest estimate of power generation costs by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, atomic power would cost at least ¥10.3 per kilowatt-hour in 2030 — cheaper than power derived from fossil fuels, natural gas, wind and solar energy. That’s higher than the ¥8.9 projected in 2011 and is based on a projection that costs for plant decommissioning and compensation from a severe accident would jump to ¥9.1 trillion from the ¥5.8 trillion estimated in 2011, reflecting the Fukushima nuclear crisis. METI also said additional safety measures required to run a nuclear reactor would cost an average of ¥60.1 billion. But the increase in overall generation costs is limited because the probability of a nuclear accident would decrease after utilities complete their safety measures, it said. In the report, the ministry also estimates that coal-fired power will cost ¥12.9 per kwh and liquefied natural gas ¥13.4 per kwh, compared with earlier projections of ¥10.3 and ¥10.9, respectively. Wind power would cost up to ¥34.7, solar power up to ¥16.4, geothermal power ¥16.8, and hydropower up to ¥27.1 per kwh, the report said. In its national energy policy adopted last year, the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to reduce reliance on nuclear power and promote renewable energy as much as possible, while standing by nuclear as a key power source, citing the importance of a stable electricity supply to economic growth. Japan is expecting a glut in solar power because utilities refuse to upgrade their power grids to purchase all the energy as mandated under the feed-in tariff system. A study has found that seven of the nation’s utilities lack the transmission network capacity to accept all of the solar power energy that suppliers plan to generate, METI says. Combined, they can only accept 58 percent of the total, METI said. METI began looking into their transmission capacities after five utilities decided to cap their clean energy intake, revolting against the government’s plan to increase generation of renewable energy in light of the Fukushima disaster. Under the feed-in tariff system, utilities are obliged to purchase all electricity generated from such sources as solar, wind and geothermal power at fixed rates for a set period. But the system ran into a roadblock after new suppliers flooded the solar power business, prompting the utilities to suspend signing power-purchasing contracts in September amid fears that overcapacity could cause blackouts.. Currently, all of Japan’s commercial nuclear reactors remain offline to pass a beefed-up safety screenings based on new, more stringent regulations drafted after the Fukushima meltdowns. The government is planning to restart reactors that have met the post-Fukushima safety requirements.",

    "source": "Tokyo ramps up 'English village' plan as 2020 approaches <eos> As Tokyo gears up to host the 2020 Olympic Games, demands for action are growing to overcome Japan’s notorious English-speaking phobia. To achieve that, discussions are underway for the capital to establish “English villages” — language education facilities aimed at improving students’ communication ability through the use of all-English environments. In other parts of Japan, facilities of this type are run by municipalities or schools free of charge and use games and other recreational activities to teach the language. A growing number of municipalities are investing in such institutions, and Tokyo may soon jump on the bandwagon. Let’s take a look at the situation with English villages and how Tokyo’s plan is developing. Is Tokyo going to create an English village? The proposal emerged in “Long-Term Vision for Tokyo,” a report the capital published in December. Aside from more active acceptance of exchange students and foreign teachers, the report said Tokyo aims to internationalize educational environments for schoolchildren by establishing what it tentatively called an English village. The facility will be an all-English community that “enables students to learn what it is like living overseas and enjoy cross-cultural communication” through cultural programs involving native speakers of English. A group of experts in English education and global business gathered at City Hall for the first time last month to discuss potential content for Tokyo’s idea. How are the talks going? At the moment, few details have been fleshed out, including location, scale and basic concept. But the panel is expected to examine and reach conclusions on the specifics by the end of the year, said Tomomitsu Ishige, an official at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. “Few schoolchildren who have gone through a six-year education in Japan’s junior high and high school systems actually learn to speak English,” Ishige said. Since Tokyo is set to host the Olympic Games in 2020, pressure is growing to alter the status quo and foster youths who can communicate fluently with foreigners, the official added, noting the English village project is part of an attempt to nurture such people. Are there other English villages in Japan? Kinki University in Osaka Prefecture is widely believed to have been the first to establish this type of facility in Japan. Its English village debuted in November 2006 with the aim of allowing visitors to acquire practical English skills through fun activities and events, including dancing and cooking, that native speakers also engage in. Open Monday through Friday, the all-English village is geared mainly toward the university’s students and faculty. Are other entities following Kinki University’s lead? Hiyoshigaoka High School in the city of Kyoto, for one, aims to create its own English village by the end of fiscal 2015. The school will start renovating an entire floor of one of its buildings to turn it into an all-English community that will cater not only to students, but also sometimes to the public, Vice Principal Hiroaki Hirai said. Titled Hello Village, the facility plans to allow visitors to communicate with five of the school’s full-time assistant language teachers, or ALTs, outside class hours, such as during lunchtime and after school. Having long prided itself on its communication-focused English education, Hiyoshigaoka High hopes the initiative will “further increase students’ exposure to authentic English,” Hirai said, adding that the school will borrow a page from Kinki University’s playbook to implement the project. Are there other examples? Not every English village will match the scale of the one built by Kinki University. The city of Neyagawa in Osaka Prefecture, too, launched what it termed an English village project last year, targeting fifth-graders from all of its 24 public elementary schools. Under the project, children from each school are invited once a year to an educational facility run by the board of education to engage in leisure activities with foreign teachers all day. The event is also characterized as an opportunity for students to put their lessons into practice, such as by giving directions and explaining how to cook Japanese food, so they can discover the joy of “making themselves understood in English,” said Ai Tada, head of the facility. “Of course, it’s not like students will be able to improve their English-speaking skills dramatically just because they spent a day at our facility,” Tada said. Rather, the purpose of the city’s English village project boils down to awakening interest in real-life English communication and motivating students to study the language harder in their classes at school. Likewise, elementary schools in Yokohama are undertaking similar English village activities under a project launched by the city in 2009. Participating schools host an all-English festival once a year in which ALTs set up their own booths to amuse children through a variety of entertainment-oriented activities, including a quiz contest. Like Neyagawa in Osaka, the Yokohama project also prioritizes inspiration, rather than improving actual proficiency in the language, said Yokohama official Tsuyoshi Ichihara. Despite apparent improvement in the children’s willingness to converse with native speakers, the city, however, remains unable to scale up the project due to budgetary limitations, he added. Are these facilities effective in nurturing English-speaking ability? Kensaku Yoshida, director of the Center for Language Education and Research at Sophia University in Tokyo, said the answer is yes. “Children in elementary school, for example, are given such limited hours of exposure to English that it’s nearly impossible for them to be fluent in the language just by studying within school,” Yoshida said. In this regard, it is “very effective” to offer students English-speaking opportunities like this outside classroom hours, he said. As for the upcoming Tokyo version, Yoshida said he is concerned first and foremost about what educational programs it will offer, rather than its scale or other details. Given that the envisioned institution has its sights set on the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, its programs should go beyond being merely recreational, Yoshida said, adding they should also be able to aid in the improvement of students’ actual English skills. A key to achieving that, he proposed, is to involve as many foreign youths as possible, such as children at international schools and exchange students. Being close in age, Japanese students will likely find them easier to interact with than native adult speakers, such as ALTs, he said.",

    "source": "Osaka's 'win-win' merger may leave the people lost <eos> In a historic first, Osaka municipal voters go to the polls today to vote on a referendum that, if approved, will divide the city into five semi-autonomous wards. For years, Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto and his Osaka Ishin no Kai (One Osaka) local party have hammered home the message that, without the merger, bureaucratic redundancy with Osaka Prefecture cannot be eliminated, economic growth cannot occur, social welfare services cannot be improved and true local, grass-roots democracy in Osaka cannot flourish. Sounds very nice, doesn’t it? Especially the last bit about grass-roots democracy. But some tough questions remain: How much will the merger really cost? What happens to the existing municipal debt (partially due to white elephant projects built two decades ago)? And what happens to local services? Answers are contradictory, elusive or confusing. Thus, local media polls last week showed more people opposed the merger than supported it. Whatever the final result, it’s important to remember that, traditionally, those yelling loudest for an Osaka merger were not local politicians, bureaucrats or even Osaka residents, but a few major corporations in the Kansai Economic Federation and the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry. These (mostly) old men have decades of experience running the city of Osaka behind the scenes. Their motivation for a merger is simple: more influence over the local tax base and, hopefully, cheaper costs for their businesses (by eliminating redundancy with the prefecture). An Osaka merger poses many questions. But one of the less-discussed issues is likely intensified competition among the five new autonomous wards to lure more corporate taxpayers or keep them from bolting to a neighboring ward to get a better deal. The business mandarins hope to find themselves courted by five local heads and elected assemblies, all of whom would inquire how their ward might use their newfound powers of the purse to provide ever-more tax breaks and deregulation to make, or keep, the mandarins happy. If that means cuts in citizen services have to be made, well, no worries. Ward leaders can tell residents that whatever tax money gets cut for their services today to provide business incentives will come back tomorrow in the form of new jobs and increased corporate tax revenue. That may be true and they may sincerely believe it. But it should not be forgotten that many Osaka business leaders do not live in the city of Osaka but in the nicer parts of the prefecture and neighboring Hyogo or Kyoto. They’re interested in seeing tax money used in ways that benefit their bottom line, not get spent (too much) on schools, day care centers and social welfare services they or their families will never use. In other words, many senior corporate leaders view the city of Osaka less as a democratic entity and more as a strategic “location” that now needs to show its “international competitive advantage” in terms of cost of operations. From an economic point of view, it’s common sense. But what’s being asked today is whether voters believe a merger will not only improve local democracy and public services but also convince nonresident shareholders and directors of some of Japan’s largest and most politically connected firms that their tax needs will be met and they will invest in the new Osaka. Maybe. Efforts by the city and prefecture to keep Osaka firms in the city back in the 1990s with various incentives failed miserably. “Win-win” is a nice phrase bantered about in business school, in corporate training seminars and by Osaka merger proponents. It may even be true. However, history suggests voters need to remember their Latin today as well as their English: caveat emptor , or “let the buyer beware.”",

    "source": "Stores struggle to adjust in a shrinking Japan <eos> On April 16, McDonald’s Japan announced it would be closing 130 stores this year. Add to this the franchises that don’t plan on renewing their contracts, and the number of lost outlets tops 190. The fast food giant has 3,000 in Japan, so maybe that 190 doesn’t sound like much, but when you look at the company’s recent performance, it’s obviously in trouble: a 14.4 percent annual drop in revenue, putting it ¥38 billion in the red. So far the company hasn’t announced which stores will be closed, thus causing anxiety for workers as well as customers in remote areas where, for what it’s worth, McDonald’s may be the only fast food restaurant available. The firm plans to turn its fortunes around by remodeling outlets, changing menus and encouraging regular employees to consider early retirement. Some media have been saying that the problem has to do with the bad publicity surrounding the out-of-date chicken McDonald’s Japan was buying from a Chinese supplier last summer. As it happens, McDonald’s is also not doing well in its home market, the U.S., but the reason there is said to be changing consumer tastes, which now demand “healthier” fare. Japan’s drop in sales is markedly greater than it is in the U.S., which is especially surprising considering how well the Japanese arm was doing only a few years ago. The downward trend may have more to do with general circumstances in Japan, since other restaurant chains are having similar problems. Watami, the nationwide chain of izakaya (pub-restaurants), announced last November that it was closing 102 outlets, or 15 percent of its total. The reason is not just the drop in sales, but also difficulty in finding workers. Watami was accused some years back of being a “black kigyō ” — a company that exploited workers, mainly by making them work overtime for no pay. Some, like the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, have found the job situation encouraging from a macro standpoint — when workers are scarce, wages increase, which means more spending in the long run — but that idea assumes demand remains basically the same or increases. As the population drops, so will consumption. At any rate, according to the labor ministry, average wages have gone down by 2.8 percent in the last year despite the worker shortage. Last week the internal affairs ministry announced that the number of children under the age of 15 has reached a record low, a statistic that will also affect restaurants in the long run, since eating out is less common among older people. Only 12 percent of two-or-more-person households made up of people over 70 eat out, while 26 percent of households with people under 30 eat out with any sort of regularity. The percentage of people who consume takeout food is constant for all age groups at 10-11 percent. The downward trend extends to retail. According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the number of retail outlets in Japan peaked in 1982 at 1.72 million. By 2007, the total had dwindled to 1.14 million. During this same period, the number of people working in retail dropped by 2.4 percent, so the trend is hardly new. Much of this change has to do with the rise of online shopping, but METI estimates that the total retail sector will shrink by ¥28 trillion before 2030. The contraction has already reduced the number of retail businesses run by individuals, as evidenced by the demise of shopping arcades in smaller cities throughout Japan. Between 1982 and 2007, the number of retail businesses with less than five employees fell by half to 750,000. In a special publication by the magazine Takarajima about the decline of regional cities, department stores are presented as the most graphic example of shrinkage. The department store market has decreased by 70 percent since its peak years in the mid-1990s. Eleven department stores went out of business in 2010, and since then some of those remaining have merged with competitors to survive. Much has been made lately of how Chinese tourists are propping up department store business, but it’s only in the major cities. At present, the department store market is valued at about ¥6 trillion, and this will fall to ¥5 trillion by 2030. The so-called big store law, passed in the 1990s, allowed for larger retail chain outlets and led to an increase in the number of suburban shopping malls. There were 312 stores with floor area of at least 1,500 sq. meters in the six northernmost prefectures of Honshu in 2001. The number increased to 493 by 2013, but the combined sales for all big stores in the region only went from ¥1.2 trillion to ¥1.25 trillion during the same period. Takarajima predicts that by 2020, convenience store revenues will have surpassed those of supermarkets, thanks to the former’s ability to diversify goods and services for a wider range of customers. That said, even convenience stores are seeing a drop in sales. At present, they are addressing the problem by trying to meet the needs of seniors and single-person households — the two demographics with the most potential right now.",

    "source": "Keeping the yakuza away from the 2020 Olympics <eos> The 2020 Olympics in Tokyo should be a cause for celebration but this may depend on who you talk to. Takajima Publishing released a book by Yoshinari Ichinomiya in June 2014 titled “2020 Black Money and the Tokyo Olympics” that portrays the event as an underworld party. In a chapter titled “The Yakuza Olympics,” Ichinomiya discusses the alleged ties that Hidetoshi Tanaka, vice president of the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC), has had to organized crime in the past. It references a September 1998 photograph of Tanaka with the former head of the Sumiyoshi-kai, the second-largest yakuza group in the country, at Hotel New Otani Tokyo. The Shukan Bunshun was the first to publish the photo in February 2014. With the author estimating that total spending on the games may reach ¥1 trillion, there’s going to be plenty of money floating around for anyone interested in a cut — including the Yamaguchi-gumi. The Yamaguchi-gumi isn’t just an organized crime syndicate, it’s an international corporation that has been in business for 100 years. The organization is the largest yakuza syndicate in the country, counting more than 25,000 registered members at the start of 2014, according to the National Police Agency. The syndicate owns myriad auditing firms, oversees hundreds of front operations and, more recently, even appears to be moving into the IT sector. In 2007, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the head of a Kodo-kai faction took over Yubitoma, the equivalent of Japan’s “classmates.com,” gaining access to the personal data of 3.5 million people. The syndicate is also politically connected. As I noted in my April column, “Learning valuable lessons from the yakuza?”, the Shukan Bunshun reported that education minister Hakubun Shimomura had received donations from a Yamaguchi-gumi Kodo-kai front company. The magazine also claimed that Masahiro Toyokawa, a longtime associate member of the Yamaguchi-gumi, founded one of Shimomura’s political support groups. Shimomura denied the allegations. Politicians, however, aren’t the only ones who appear to benefit from the underworld payouts. The Yamaguchi-gumi offers their employees a few perks when they retire in exchange for loyalty. One former senior gangster, Kenji Seiriki, says that a retiring executive could expect to be paid out ¥50 million or more. While government officials in Japan appear reluctant to confront issues relating to organized crime, the U.S. government is taking a more proactive approach. The U.S. Treasury Department froze American-owned assets controlled by the Yamaguchi-gumi and the syndicate’s top two leaders in February 2012. On April 21, U.S. officials went one step further and announced similar measures against the Kodo-kai, the same faction linked with Shimomura. “The Kodo-kai is known to be the most violent faction within the Yamaguchi-gumi and is headquartered in Nagoya, Japan, with about 4,000 members,” the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement announcing the sanctions. “Among other criminal activities, the Kodo-kai has conducted extortion and engaged in bribery on behalf of the Yamaguchi-gumi and has gained prominence in part for its financial muscle.” The financial sanctions also apply to Teruaki Takeuchi, chairman of the Kodo-kai. “Takeuchi is also linked to the Inagawa-kai syndicate, the third-largest Yakuza syndicate in Japan, through a symbolic brotherhood he shares with Kazuo Uchibori, the second-in-command of the Inagawa-kai,” the Treasury statement said. “Such brotherhoods have the power to signify alliances among yakuza syndicates.” Takeuchi and Uchibori are both expected to take over their organizations by this time next year, police sources say. The Inagawa-kai (Tokyo) will effectively be under the Yamaguchi-gumi umbrella — just in time for 2020. It isn’t the first time an administration has attempted to confront the Kodo-kai. In 2009, the National Police Agency declared war on the Nagoya-based syndicate, directing all departments to utilize whatever resources they had at their disposal to arrest gangsters and destroy revenue sources. Shinobu Tsukasa was head of the Kodo-kai at the time; he is now the sixth and current head of the Yamaguchi-gumi. Tsukasa has already attracted some attention in official circles this year after a photograph mysteriously surfaced that features the Yamaguchi-gumi leader sitting alongside JOC Vice President Tanaka at a club in Nagoya in the mid-2000s. The photo was sent to a number of media outlets by an individual claiming to be an unhappy Nihon University employee. On April 23, Gendai Business reported that a right-wing newspaper had tried to publish the photograph but the publisher’s employees were assaulted after they contacted Nihon University for clarification. According to a report in the Sankei Shimbun, Tanaka claims the photo is a fake. Ishin no To (Japan Innovation Party) lawmaker Yoshio Maki has recently been looking into possible links between the yakuza and the Olympics. In education committee meetings in April, he held up several newspaper and magazine articles that included the photo of Tsukasa apparently with Tanaka, and demanded an explanation. Maki asked Shimomura, the education minister who is also in charge of overseeing preparations for the Tokyo Games, why the government has yet to investigate the olympic committee’s possible ties to organized crime. Shimomura pledged to investigate the claims personally and, given his alleged connections, just might be the right man for the job. “Shimomura’s reply is just a formality,” Maki later told me. “Asking the JOC and Nihon University to investigate on their own will only produce an answer that is expected.” We can only wait and see if Shimomura is able to get some results and keep the yakuza out of the Olympics but perhaps, as they say, “don’t hold your breath.”",

    "source": "U.S. warships to accompany American-flagged ships through Strait of Hormuz <eos> WASHINGTON - U.S. Navy ships will begin accompanying U.S. commercial ships during their transit through the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf to ensure they encounter no interference from Iran, U.S. defense officials said Thursday. The new policy, which has not yet been announced officially, was adopted in response to what Washington views as provocative Iranian behavior. Earlier this week Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps naval vessels reportedly fired warning shots near a Marshall Islands-flagged cargo ship and have detained it and its crew. Iran says it intervened with the Maersk Tigris because the Maersk shipping line owes it money awarded in a lawsuit. Iranian naval patrol boats also surrounded a U.S. cargo vessel in the strait on April 25 before departing without further incident. The Pentagon later said it considered the incident a provocation. The strait is narrow and partially within Iranian territorial waters. Under an internationally recognized protocol called “innocent passage,” maritime traffic is permitted to pass through the strait without interference, even if ships at times are in Iranian territorial waters, so long as they are not violating strictures against such things as carrying weapons or collecting intelligence. U.S. defense officials said the decision to begin accompanying U.S. commercial vessels as they transit the strait was based on a recommendation by U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for U.S. military operations in the Middle East. Defense Secretary Ash Carter was briefed on the decision, one official said, adding that the Obama administration does not want the move to be seen as provocative, given the delicate state of the Iran nuclear agreement. The pact has yet to be finalized and is the subject of intense scrutiny and considerable criticism in Congress. The officials were not authorized to discuss the decision publicly and spoke anonymously. At an unrelated Pentagon news conference, Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove was asked about the decision and said he was aware of it. Breedlove, the top U.S. commander of NATO in Europe, said the Navy is well-practiced at protecting freedom of navigation in the Gulf. “It is a mission they have done in the past,” he said. The Navy makes a distinction between accompanying ships and escorting them, although the difference appears to be small. The officials said U.S. Navy ships will be present in and near the Strait of Hormuz while U.S. commercial vessels are in transit, but they will not escort them continuously. The 5th Fleet, which is the naval arm of Central Command, currently has a destroyer, the USS Farragut, in the Gulf, as well as three smaller coastal patrol ships. No additional ships are being dispatched to the region, one official said. U.S. Navy ships will be in continuous radio contact with the commercial ships and possibly will stay in visual contact during their transit of the strait, the officials said. The U.S. commercial shipping companies will be notified in advance of these new procedures. One official said the new approach will be reviewed daily, taking into account Iranian behavior. The circumstances of Iran’s seizure earlier this week of the MV Maersk Tigris remain unclear. A spokesman for the Danish shipper, Michael Storgaard, said the company learned Thursday that an Iranian appeals court had ruled the company must pay $3.6 million for a 10-container cargo delivered a decade ago on behalf of an Iranian company in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. However, the cargo never was collected, according to Storgaard, adding it eventually was disposed of by local authorities. Storgaard said Copenhagen-based Maersk Line will “do everything we can to resolve this matter” with Iranian authorities. He added the ship and crew aren’t theirs. MV Maersk Tigris, operated by Rickmers Ship Management in Singapore, was boarded on Tuesday.",

    "source": "Italy hopes Milan's scandal-dogged Expo 2015 will feed economy, raise spirits <eos> MILAN, ITALY - Italy opens the Milan Expo on Friday, torn between hopes that the showcase of global culture and technology will cheer up a gloomy national mood and fears that it will be overshadowed by scandal, delays and street protests. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who is counting on the Expo to reinforce fragile signs of economic recovery, says the event will be a litmus test for the future of Italy after years of stagnation and recession. But the event has already faced a corruption investigation that saw several top officials in the organizing body arrested, cost overruns, and construction holdups that will mean large parts of the 110-hectare site will not be ready for opening day. Planned demonstrations by anti-Expo campaigners and fears of security incidents following a gun attack in a Milan courthouse last month have also dampened the mood. Officials say the problems will be forgotten once the six-month-long exhibition of products and technologies from around the world begins. The opening ceremony will include a message from Pope Francis relayed by television link from the Vatican. With 10 million tickets already sold, they are counting on some 20 million people attending, and hope overall revenues will top €10 billion ($10.75 billion), half of it from foreign visitors. But the fair, which follows the 2010 Expo in Shanghai, has also rallied a diverse range of protest movements, from anti-globalization and environmentalist groups to students and anti-austerity campaigners. Tens of thousands of demonstrators, grouped under the umbrella label NoExpo, are expected to take to the streets of Milan on Friday in protest an event many see as a symbol of big business interests hiding behind a cover of green sustainability. Thousands of police have been assigned to counter the protests. On Thursday, parts of the city center were closed off due to a smaller march by students carrying banners with slogans including “Our generation rejects Expo and what it represents.” Expo 2015 will feature interactive technological displays on the theme of “Feeding the Planet,” with national pavilions from 54 countries presenting educational exhibitions and samples of local cuisine. Cultural events, futuristic architecture, a “supermarket of the future” and dozens of restaurants fill the site, which, critics note, required more than 1 sq. km (250 acres) of farmland on the outskirts of Milan to be concreted over. In all, 145 countries are taking part, with 54 national pavilions. China, an increasing presence in the Italian economy after a string of high-profile business acquisitions, is particularly well represented.",

    "source": "Cities outshine Tokyo on energy mix with ambitious goal for renewables <eos> By the end of this month, the government is expected to announce a national long-term energy plan for 2030 that will include a “best energy mix” scenario — the formula for the various ratios of oil, coal, LNG, nuclear power and renewable energy that will be powering Japan in 15 years’ time. Of the different energy sources, it’s the role of the latter two that has provoked the most tension and argument. Last month, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry panel in charge of setting Japan’s energy mix goals for the next 15 years predicted that by 2030, nuclear power would still be the cheapest source available, at ¥10.1 per kilowatt-hour. While the cost of using renewables is expected to drop somewhat from their levels in 2011, the government insists they will still be more expensive than nuclear power. METI’s goal for 2030 shows Japan’s energy mix consisting of 27 percent LNG, 26 percent coal, 3 percent oil, 22 to 24 percent renewable energy, and 20 to 22 percent nuclear. Within the renewable portion, the major sources are expected to be hydro (8.8-9.1 percent), solar (7 percent), biomass (3.7 to 4.6 percent), wind (1.7 percent, including land and offshore farms), and geothermal (1 to 1.1 percent). But it is not just pro-renewable energy groups and international organizations like Greenpeace that believe the 20 to 22 percent goal for nuclear is unrealistically high and the 22 to 24 percent goal for renewable energy is unrealistically low. Earlier this month, the mayors and representatives of 19 of Japan’s largest cities, whose combined population of over 27 million is about one-fifth of the country’s total, gathered in Kyoto to discuss the future of renewable energy. In a letter to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the group called for the government to set a “30 by 30” target, or having renewable energy generate 30 percent of Japan’s total electricity by 2030. “In order to realize a sustainable, low carbon society and accelerate the introduction of renewable energy, the central government should not only set a high target for renewable energy, but also offer assistance for the development of battery storage and hydrogen technology as well (as a) detailed policy for assisting the introduction of renewable energy in our various local energy plans. The government should also indicate targets for each renewable energy source,” the letter said. “As to the overall share of renewable energy, the central government should set a positive goal of 30 percent of electricity generated by renewables,” it added. In fiscal 2014, due to what the nation’s utilities said was projected oversupply from renewable-energy producers that caused them to temporarily suspend purchases of such energy under the feed-in tariff system , the use of renewable energy rose 1.5 percent over 2013. Renewables now account for more than 12 percent of Japan’s electricity at present. By 2030, the mayors see small and midsize solar facilities and biomass facilities (based on sewage and sludge as well as forestry) as being key sources of renewable energy. They also called for increased government support for developing hydrogen energy, especially things like filling stations. But the major cities are not waiting on Tokyo to set their local energy policy. They all have different targets and policies for the future. Most of these are based on logical assumptions about future advancements in both renewable-energy generation technology and the development of more energy-efficient houses, cars and electronic goods, as well as statistics about how their demographic changes are projected to unfold in the coming years. The result, for the most part, is goals, or at least predictions, for the future use of renewable energy on a local level that appear far more ambitious than the national goal being pursued by the central government. For example, the city of Kyoto aims to reduce energy consumption by 15 percent by 2020 (compared to 2010 levels), and plans to increase the amount of renewable energy it uses by 2020. Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, plans to hike renewable energy use by a factor of five by 2030 from 2011, while reducing energy consumption 10 percent. Fukuoka has said it plans to quadruple the amount of installed capacity for renewable energy by 2022, while Yokohama has set a goal of more than tripling its installed capacity by 2030, and having almost three times the current level of generated electricity come from renewables. Sapporo is one of the few major cities that has declared a specific goal for reducing its dependence on nuclear power. Hokkaido’s largest city plans to reduce its pre-2011 reliance on atomic generation by half by 2022, through a combination of conservation measures, renewable-energy initiatives, and other energy policies. In Osaka, where Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto has waged highly public battles with Kansai Electric Power Co. over nuclear energy, the city plans to increase the amount of solar power it uses by 900,000 kw. “Local production, local consumption of energy, as well as energy-saving policies mean that cities around Japan can lead the way in setting goals and policies for renewable energy that the central government should use as a reference,” Kyoto Mayor Daisaku Kadokawa, who heads the group of mayors that sent Abe the letter, told reporters at the Kyoto conference. “While each city may choose to set its own specific energy plans, the longer-term goal should be, as much as possible, not (to) rely on nuclear power,” he said.",

    "source": "Phone users in Japan still paying for plenty of stuff they don't need <eos> Last fall, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications set guidelines for “unlocking” mobile phones. Until now, in principle, a handset sold by one of Japan’s three main mobile communications companies — NTT Docomo, KDDI and SoftBank — could only be used for that particular service, meaning if you wanted to switch companies, you had to buy a new one. The guidelines were to go into effect at the beginning of May. The changes will only affect new phones, and they can only be unlocked — at no charge if done online — for their original owners. Moreover, customers of each company will have to wait six months after purchasing their phones to get them unlocked. Which manufacturers this will affect and how mobile phone fees and contracts will change isn’t clear at the moment, but it seems the guidelines were issued in response to complaints from consumers about the high cost of mobile communications in Japan, the idea being that unlocking phones will spur competition. The purpose of locking the SIM cards — those devices that determine which network the phone connects to — is to keep customers aligned to particular carriers, which mandate two-year contracts for services. Last year, the ministry conducted a survey and found that Japanese households spent on average ¥112,453 a year for telephone land lines, Internet services and mobile communications. Altogether, the amount spent for such services accounted for 3.72 percent of all household expenditures, up from 3.28 percent in 2003. Telecommunications fees are higher in Japan than in most other countries, owing mainly to the steep fees charged by the “Big Three.” Two years ago, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun published a report on how Japan’s mobile phone subscription model is a racket. The purpose of the scheme is to attract new customers with something that’s easy to understand — a free phone — and then get them to sign contracts with high monthly fees and options through the use of confusing terms that change from one carrier to another. The price of the phone is paid off in monthly installments, but if the customer is new, that monthly payment is waived as long as the customer signs up for two years. If the customer breaks the contract, then in addition to paying a penalty, he or she has to pay off the balance of the phone’s price, but since the phone can only be used for that carrier, the customer has to buy a new one if they switch to a competing service. However, most mobile phone companies, and not just the Big Three, increasingly offer an “ ikkatsu zero-yen” option, meaning the phone is free as soon as you sign the contract. This seems to be the reason for the unlock waiting period, since theoretically people could sign a contract, get a free phone, unlock the SIM card and resell the phone for a price higher than the contract-breaking penalty. By now most consumers understand that the free phone gambit is a dodge, especially with the advent of the smartphone, which comes with more options and potential fees due to its main function as a data access/processing device rather than simply a telephone designed to make calls. Rakuten Research did its own survey of mobile phone users last year, with 40 percent saying they want to “review” their payment plans and 30 percent saying they are trying to save money by “using their phone less.” One way of doing that is to change their “fixed-price plan” for telephone calls. All three carriers have fixed monthly fees for unlimited calls and, according to the Rakuten survey, 60 percent of users think fixed fees for unlimited voice calls “are not necessary,” because they don’t use their phones much for talking, or they use apps such as Line and Skype to make voice calls over the Internet. This latter development was studied more closely by Mobile Marketing Data Laboratory, which found that 59 percent of the smartphone users it surveyed use Internet voice communication applications, and thus probably don’t need a conventional voice call feature. However, only 18 percent of those surveyed use Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO), less expensive carriers that use other companies’ networks and stress data communications over voice communications. When asked by the researchers why they don’t switch to an MVNO if they don’t need the voice function so much, 38 percent say they don’t know much about it. In other words, it’s easier just to remain with your current carrier, even if you’re paying for services you may not need. Our own informal survey of several dozen MVNOs found that the contract terms are no less confusing than those of the Big Three, but the fees are more competitive, and if, as the Mobile Marketing Data Lab survey shows, only a small percent of consumers subscribe to MVNOs, then at least the competition they provide seems to be paying off. For one thing, almost no one charges a fee any more if you want to keep your phone number when you change carriers, including the Big Three. The main issue is paying only for what you need. When we went to Docomo to inquire about trading in our old FOMA cell phone plan for a smart phone plan, we found out that our monthly fees, for two persons on a “family plan,” would increase from about ¥5,000 a month to almost ¥12,000. We made the same inquiry to MVNOs such as OCN and Rakuten and most came up with cheaper plans. However, the answers we received were different depending on who we spoke to, even within the same company. The problem, we discovered, is not so much price and terms, but employees who don’t seem to understand their company’s services and don’t know how to answer potential customers’ specific questions.",

    "source": "Most common name for company chiefs in Japan is Makoto Sato: survey <eos> If your name happens to be Makoto Sato, the chances of you rising through the corporate ranks all the way to the top are probably higher than others. That’s according to results from a survey on the most prevalent names for company presidents among 2.6 million corporations in the country, released Wednesday by Tokyo Shoko Research. The survey found there were 174 Makoto Satos at the helm of firms in Japan as of December, followed by 168 Takashi Suzukis and 151 Shigeru Suzukis. The name Makoto, meaning “sincere,” also proved the most popular first name among company presidents, possessed by no less than 11,267 of them. Other common first names of company presidents were Hiroshi (“erudite”) at 9,176; Shigeru (“ebullient”) at 9,146; Takashi (“prosperous”) at 8,378, and Osamu (“educated”) at 8,055. The research institute reasoned that the popularity of Makoto is due partly to the fact that the name was the most popular among baby boys annually during 18 years between 1957 and 1978. As for surnames, Sato, Suzuki and Tanaka occupied the top three spots, accounting for 34,038, 32,594 and 25,909 presidents, respectively. By region, Sato ranked first in Hokkaido and in the Tohoku region. Suzuki, meanwhile, proved to be the most prevalent family name in the Kanto region, as did Kato and Ito in the Chubu region. Tanaka was the most common surname of a president in Kyushu.",

During his on-air explanation of the nation’s many mascots, Oliver highlighted Funassyi, the giant yellow pear who is the unofficial mascot of Funabashi in Chiba, and included one of his more explosive moments on TV . Need to know more about Japan’s most popular pear? At first Funnasyi was rejected as the official mascot of his hometown but unlike other successful official mascots, such as Kumamon of Kumamoto Prefecture, Funassyi has come to symbolize Funabashi despite its lack of government sponsorship and become just as popular as any yuru-kyara. Funnasyi has appeared in national commercials for the Asahi, released a CD single, and been crowned the Grand-Prix winner at an international trade show for character and brand businesses best license in Japan in 2014 as he traveled across Japan and the world to spread his pear-y special brand of energy. Here are just a few of highlights from 2014: Funassyi’s popularity hit a milestone last year when, as he was being featured on CNN in June, the news reporter couldn’t help but laugh throughout the broadcast when she saw the mascot flapping his arms around. In July, Funassyi tried to kickstart a fashion trend by donning a black cap with a “274” logo (a play on the numbers 2-7-4 with can sound like “fu-na-shi”) and appeared in a TV commercial for Shimamura, a fashion shopping center. The fast-running pear with non-stop squealing had fans wondering how he survived the summer heat in his suit . In September, FUNAcafe, a collaboration event of Funassyi and Shibuya Parco’s The Guest Cafe & Diner, served a special Funassyi-inspired menu including the “funa” burger (with his face on the burger), nashi pear cake, nashi pear tea and even dandan noodles. The character’s popularity went international when he visited Hong Kong in October, attending a local shopping mall event and bringing Japanese yuru-kyara culture with him. Judging by this video, Funassyi’s fans in Hong Kong are just as passionate as those in Tokyo. In December, the toy company “Kitan Club” released a Funnasyi-style version of its famous Cup-no-Fuchiko cup-straddling toys. The brands are literally embracing each other as the tiny figurines can cling to each other in three different kinds of positions and as expected of Cup-no-Fuchiko both can sit on the edge of the cup. The announcement climbed to the top of Fuji Television’s weekly Twitter rankings, beating out the hot issue of Japan’s strict state secrets law. きょうの「ツイラン」5〜1位はコチラ☆コップのフチ子×ふなっしーのコラボにボクも注目(⁎˃ᴗ˂⁎) 旬の話題は「ついっぷるトレンド」で！ ⇒ http://t.co/RJXmGBhQLC #めざましテレビ pic.twitter.com/v2lk7DgcH6 — めざましテレビ (@cx_mezamashi) December 11, 2014 Funassyi is expanding his brand aggressively by creating Funassyi stories everywhere in Japan. Funassyiland, a Funaasyi goods store, opened in Fukuoka in December. According to Asahi Digital News , Funassyi devotees from as far as Tokyo were making the trek. Funassyi’s naturally fragile yet good-natured personality seems to be a starting point. The pear rounded out 2014 on Nippon TV by rocking out with his hero, Ozzy Osbourne, performing a headbanging rendition of Osbourne’s “Crazy Train.” Funassyi got a little wet and wild when Osbourne dumped a bucket of water on him before pushing him into a swimming pool. In the same month, whilst making a cameo during a commemorative concert for The Alfee, Funassyi took an untimely tumble but nothing went pear-shaped: the resilient character sprung back into action minutes later. Without a doubt, Funassyi was a hit in 2014 but only time will tell if the rest of 2015 will keep rewarding the fruits of his labor.",

Iwate took the action Thursday to prevent local industries from being adversely affected by Taipei’s decision to require that all food imports from Japan carry certificates of origin due to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis. Opposing the tougher restrictions as “scientifically groundless,” the Japanese government has said it will not issue the new certification requested by Taipei. The prefectural government said Iwate is the first in the Tohoku region to issue certificates of origin for items bound for Taiwan, which mainly imports processed sea urchins, scallops and soybeans from the prefecture facing the Pacific Ocean. Iwate can issue the certificates in a few hours to producers who apply, officials said. Since the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant disaster started, Taiwan has banned food imports from Fukushima and four nearby prefectures — Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma and Chiba. But under the new Taiwan rules, food imports from Japan’s 42 other prefectures, including Iwate, must be accompanied by certificates of origin. The Japanese government has urged Taipei to retract the requirement. Taiwan has said certificates of origin can be replaced with existing quarantine certificates, but they are not issued for processed goods.",

The warning signal that alerts passengers to train departures at JR Kamata Station is the tune used in the 1982 movie “Kamata Koshinkyoku” (“Fall Guy”). It was also a theme tune of the Kamata film studio owned by Shochiku Kinema, predecessor of Shochiku Co., where the movie was filmed. A scale model of the film studio belonging to Shochiku, a major kabuki, movie and theater production company, from 1920 to 1936 in the Kamata district in Ota Ward, Tokyo, is on display in the basement exhibition space at Ota Kumin Hall, better known as Aprico Hall. | YOSHIAKI MIURA Opened in 1920, the Kamata studio led the country’s prewar film industry until 1936. While it put many actors and actresses on the road to stardom, the studio is also known for producing Japan’s first domestic “talkie.” As the area became crowded with small factories, however, the studio eventually was forced out and moved south to Kanagawa Prefecture. The 18-story Nissay Aromasquare Building stands on the former site of the Shochiku Kinema film studio in the Kamata area in Ota Ward, Tokyo. | YOSHIAKI MIURA Nearly 80 years later, an aspiring director and his staff are planning to produce a movie based on Kamata. Director Kazuyuki Takahashi, head of nonprofit WUP Film, is producing “Mirai Shutter,” a story about young people who drop off the career ladder but are given a second chance through their encounters with local Kamata people. Efforts to revive the area’s film industry encountered funding problems, but WUP was able to involve local firms, public authorities, academic institutions and banks. Many cast members were recruited from the general public through social media tools such as Facebook. It will have around 10 non-Japanese actors and actress. One of them is Ninoy Kiat, a young Filipino-American actor who has recently started to make a name for himself. The movie is set for release this spring. Actors shoot a scene for the upcoming movie ‘Mirai Shutter’ in Ota Ward’s Umeyashiki district on Jan. 22.

    "source": "German Catholic archdiocese reveals it's richer than Vatican <eos> PARIS - The Roman Catholic archdiocese of Cologne in Germany has disclosed it is worth €3.35 billion ($3.82 billion), making it richer than the Vatican. Publication of the first full report of its wealth reflects greater financial transparency within the German Church since Pope Francis removed a bishop in Limburg, near Frankfurt, last year for spending €31 million from secret funds on a new luxury residence. Also pressed by the pope to reform its finances, the Vatican has consolidated the various — and sometimes hidden — accounts of its many departments and found it has assets of about $3 billion (€2.64 billion), Cardinal George Pell, the Holy See’s secretary for the economy, said last week. Announcing their report on Ash Wednesday, the start of the Lenten period of self-denial and reflection, Cologne church officials stressed the extensive holdings helped care for 2 million Catholics, 60,000 staff and 1,200 churches and chapels. “The archdiocese doesn’t sell products or earn profits from its services, so it has to finance itself mostly from its assets,” said financial director Hermann Schon. Germany’s Catholic and Protestant churches benefit from a church tax imposed on all their members. The report said Cologne reaped €573 million from the tax in 2013 and spent over half of that on pastoral and charity work. German dioceses had traditionally published their annual operating budgets, but not a full balance sheet. Cologne, the country’s largest diocese, had a 2012 operating budget of €939 million. Its 2013 balance sheet, drawn up under guidelines for large German companies and approved by an independent auditor, showed its assets at €3.35 billion. Its landmark Gothic cathedral along the Rhine is listed as being worth only €27 euros — €1 for each of the 26 land parcels beneath it and one euro for the priceless building. (",

    "source": "The candy, the whip and freedom of press in Japan <eos> We are familiar with the carrot-and-stick approach in the West, but the phrase in Japan is “ ame to muchi ” — literally, the candy and the whip. For journalists in Japan, there’s been a lot of whip in recent times and not much candy. How can we sweeten the deal? Since the ruling coalition came to power, press freedom in the country is the only thing that has sunk faster than the value of the yen. Reporters Without Borders this year ranked Japan at a new low, dropping two places to 61 out of 180 countries and territories, just one below Korea and several notches below Croatia. It had ranked as high as 22 in 2012. Reporters Without Borders didn’t shy away from the reasons behind Japan’s drop. “The (state secrets law) the National Diet in Japan adopted in late 2013 … (reduces) government transparency on such key national issues as nuclear power and relations with the United States, now enshrined as taboos. Investigative journalism, public interest and the confidentiality of journalists’ sources are all being sacrificed by legislators bent on ensuring that their country’s image is spared embarrassing revelations.” The domestic press hasn’t been controlled by the state to this extent since, arguably, 1937. It helps, or course, that the Islamic State group has recently carried out acts of terrorism on citizens of Japan. We live in a time when you can be labeled a “supporter of terrorism” for asking if Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s speech in Cairo on Jan. 11 — in which he pledged $200 million for “those countries contending with ISIL (another name used to describe the Islamic State group)” — may have prompted militants to target Japan. National Police Agency sources say Islamic State militants seemed to regard Japan as neutral in the conflict until Abe delivered his speech. Well, not anymore. After the crisis died down, of course, news outlets and the opposition asked a few timid questions on the wisdom of that speech and why the government didn’t seem particularly interested in saving the Japanese hostages in Syria. Nikkan Gendai noted that Abe’s response after being informed of journalist Kenji Goto’s capture by Islamic State militants was a short vacation. The government has said that it will conduct an internal review of their handling of the hostage crisis that will not be made public. On Feb. 10, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida further kicked reporters in the teeth by saying at a news conference that all matters pertaining to the hostage crisis “could be a state secret.” That’s a very subtle way of saying: “Keep asking questions and we can put you in jail.” A freelance journalist who attempted to go to Syria last month was even directly threatened with arrest. Not so subtle. It appears the Abe administration has been focusing on the press and free speech from the very beginning, using intimidation, subversion — and some candy. The press is losing. The Wall Street Journal and others noted last month that NHK chief Katsuto Momii said the state broadcaster would refrain from reporting on the issue of “comfort women” who were forced to provide sex for Japanese troops before and during World War II “until the government stance on the situation was clear.” One has to wonder what is unclear about the government’s stance. Thus when the Asahi Shimbun — disliked by the Liberal Democratic Party and Abe — last year retracted a portion of its reporting on the comfort women issue in the 1980s and ’90s — right-wing groups seized the day and went on attack. The Asahi then also retracted important testimony on the disaster at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, perhaps out of fear. Abe himself said the Asahi had brought shame upon Japan, practically declaring it an enemy of the state, and warned other newspapers to exercise care when reporting on the comfort women issue. Still, when weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun revealed that Eriko Yamatani, chairwoman of the National Public Safety Commission that oversees the National Police Agency, was linked to a hate group known as Zaitokukai, she refused to renounce them. “It’s inappropriate for government officials to criticize individual groups,” she said during a news conference at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan. In other words, it’s alright to call the Asahi shameful because the government may disagree with its reporting but it’s not alright to call out racists. Similarly, Abe kept silent during the furor that arose last month after Ayako Sono — who was appointed by the prime minister to an education reform panel in 2013 — wrote a column in the Sankei Shimbun that advocated apartheid for Japan. What can be done to encourage those who value free speech to keep on fighting for the good cause when those who speak out are attacked publicly? The FCCJ has taken a small step forward by launching the first annual Freedom of the Press Awards, which will be announced on May 3 (World Press Freedom Day). There will be a specific award for investigative journalism, as well as an award for nonjournalists who have contributed to freedom of information. (Full disclosure: I’m ineligible to be nominated for any award because I’m on the organizing committee.) The judging panel will include some heavyweight Japanese luminaries. The prizes will “confer due recognition upon journalists whose work represents the finest in defense of free speech, open society and democratic accountability.” It will also offer an award for fallen heroes. The most likely candidate for the inaugural prize is Kenji Goto, the journalist who was beheaded by jihadis after Abe’s Cairo speech. Ultimately, however, the awards should recognize those in the media doing their job — informing the public of things those in power do not want them to know. That, to me, definitely seems worth rewarding.",

M. McGregor, once a popular teacher of English in Waseda University, went to England, it may be recalled, some years ago, to follow up a new line of work he had chosen. A Canadian by birth, he has lately been heard from, and it is known that he has joined the British Army to fight at the front. The news has aroused much interest among Mr. McGregor’s former associates and pupils at Waseda, and they have bought a fine old sword to be sent to him. The sword is now on its way to England, and will be a fitting souvenir of the warm hearts of his Japanese friends. The following is the text of a letter that accompanies the sword: “Dear Mr. McGregor, “We were rather surprised when we heard of your enlistment in the army. We have thought you would be the last man to fight; not because you are afraid of fighting, but because you believe so much in peace. “We feel deep sympathy for your brave determination to go to the front. There is nothing, we think, which can better express our present feeling than a Japanese sword. “We earnestly pray that this sword may protect you through your march to victory. Wishing you good luck and all success.” 75 YEARS AGO Wednesday, March 6, 1940 12,800 war dead to be enshrined at Yasukuni Approximately 12,800 war dead will be enshrined in an extraordinary festival from April 24 to 28 at the Yasukuni Shrine, it was announced today. Those who will be deified in the shrine include officers and men of the Army and Navy who were killed in action or died of wounds or illness in the China Affair since its outbreak until the end of May, 1938. The number of 12,800 is about 2,500 larger than the number of those who were enshrined at the shrine last October. Family members of those to be deified will be invited shortly by the Army and Navy authorities to attend the special festival. 50 YEARS AGO Friday, March 19, 1965 Russian astronaut steps into outer space The Soviet Union thrilled the world with a new space triumph Thursday, being the first nation to let a spaceman step into space for a “weightless swim” before returning to a high-flying manned satellite. A 30-year-old miner’s son, Lt. Col. Alexei Leonov, became the first to separate from a spaceship in orbit — and to survive. Radio Moscow said Leonov, father of a 4-year-old girl, “felt good” as he clambered back through the Russian spacecraft, Voshkod (Sunrise) II, after his 90-minute space adventure. Leonov’s breathtaking space swim was seen by millions on television in Russia and throughout the world as Moscow released a graphic videotape two hours afterwards. Scientific observers said it appeared to put Russia far ahead in its space race with the United States. Television viewers saw Leonov, carefully shielded in a specially-equipped spacesuit and helmet, step gingerly out of the hatch of the capsule. For a few seconds he floated free in a horizontal position. Once he was seen floating upsidedown. Tass, the Soviet news agency, said Leonov moved up to 5 meters away from the spaceship as it hurtled through space at eight kilometers per second. 25 YEARS AGO Saturday, March 30, 1990 Japanese “Verses” raises Muslim ire The Japanese version of “The Satanic Verses,” put on sale the middle of last month, continues to arouse vehement protests from Muslims here and abroad. Muslims in Japan have demonstrated against the publication and are demanding that it not be sold at bookstores. Some Muslim countries are reportedly considering asking that the Japanese government ban its sale. The original publication of the book, which many Muslims consider blasphemous, prompted the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeni to pronounce a death sentence last February against Salman Rushdie, the book’s Indian-born British author. Rushdie has since been in hiding. About 130 Muslims living in Japan demonstrated in Tokyo last month in anticipation of the release of the Japanese version by the Tokyo publishing house, Shinseisha. During a Feb. 13 news conference held to announce the publication, a Pakistani national tried to assault an Italian promoter of the book. He was arrested on the scene. The book sold out immediately in Japan, and the publisher is planning to print additional copies, a spokesman of the firm said. But the Islamic Center of Japan is urging bookstores to stop selling the book. The organization, based in Tokyo’s Setagaya Ward, represents about 30,000 Muslims in Japan, a spokesman for the group said. A spokesman of the Japan-Pakistani Association in Akasaka, Tokyo, said his office is getting many calls from people voicing their desire to kill the Italian promoters. “We cannot forgive the novel because it is insulting our prophet indecently and making God’s words the devil’s words,” the spokesman said. “Japanese people also get angry when their family members are insulted.” Some major bookstores are hesitating to sell the novel. “It is difficult for us to put the book on counters because of the potential problems,” said a spokesman for Maruzen books. On July 12, 1991, the Japanese translator of the book, Hitoshi Igarashi, was found dead in his office at the University of Tsukuba. He had been stabbed multiple times. The case remains unsolved.",

    "source": "Official says Afghan avalanches kill at least 124 people <eos> PANJSHIR VALLEY, AFGHANISTAN - Avalanches caused by a heavy winter snow killed at least 124 people in northeastern Afghanistan, an emergency official said Wednesday, as rescuers clawed through debris with their hands to save those buried beneath. The avalanches buried homes across four northeast provinces, killing those beneath, said Mohammad Aslam Syas, the deputy director of the Afghanistan Natural Disaster Management Authority. The province worst hit appeared to be Panjshir province, about 100 km (60 miles) northeast of Kabul, where the avalanches destroyed or damaged around 100 homes, Syas said. The acting governor of Panjshir, Abdul Rahman Kabiri, said rescuers used their bare hands and shovels in an effort to reach survivors. Rescue teams had been dispatched to the affected areas and casualties were expected to rise, Syas said. The heavy snowstorms, which began early Tuesday, hampered rescue efforts. Snow fall from the storm was nearly 1-meter (3-feet) deep in places and fallen trees blocked roads in the Panjshir Valley. Gen. Abdul Aziz Ghirat, the provincial police chief of Panjshir, said the death toll from the avalanches was expected to rise when rescue attempts resumed at sunrise Thursday. Avalanches in the valley’s Dara district affected up to 600 families, according to people trying to reach the area to assist in rescue efforts. “People there have told me that two of my relatives have been killed and eight others are still under the snow,” said an Afghan who goes by the single name Sharafudin. “My son and I are trying to get through to see if we can help find their bodies. But it will take us at least three or four hours to get there because of the snow and the road is very narrow, so we have to walk, the car can’t get through.” He spoke at the mouth of the valley, where traffic moved at a crawl. “We’ve had no help yet from the authorities, no medicines, no machinery to open the roads so we can get to the buried houses,” Sharafudin said. Another man stuck on the highway trying to reach Dara told The Associated Press that many bodies remained in houses buried beneath feet of snow. “We are so concerned about our relatives who are just stuck there,” said the man named Abu Muslim. Large parts of Afghanistan have been covered in snow as a major storm interrupted an otherwise mild and dry winter. Authorities in Parwan province closed the strategic Salang Tunnel, which links the north and south of the country, over avalanche fears. Power cables traversing the tunnel have been damaged, cutting power to much of Kabul since earlier this week. In a statement, President Ashraf Ghani said he was “saddened by news of the avalanches and flooding across the country.” He said he had ordered urgent assessments of the extent of damage and offered his condolences to the families of the dead. Temperatures have plummeted across the country, though the snow was expected to start melting in the Panjshir Valley and much of the mountainous northwest of the Hindu Kush range in the coming days, according to forecasts. Afghanistan has suffered through some three decades of war since the Soviet invasion in 1979. But natural disasters such as landslides, floods and avalanches have taken a toll on a country with little infrastructure or development outside of its major cities. In May, a massive landslide killed anywhere from 250 to 2,700 people, authorities said at the time. Another landslide in 2012 killed 71 people. Authorities were not able to recover the vast majority of bodies and ended up declaring the site a massive grave.",

    "source": "Filipino, Indonesian trainee nurses to get more time to pass Japan exams <eos> The government decided Tuesday to allow nursing and care trainees from Indonesia and the Philippines to stay an additional year for further training and to give failed candidates another chance to sit their qualification exams to work in Japan under bilateral free trade agreements. The Cabinet decision is aimed at giving potential nurses and caregivers a better chance of passing their exams and securing permission to work in the profession in Japan. Pass rates have been low because of the language barrier. Both the Indonesian and Philippines governments have called for an extension. It is the third time the government has decided to give an extra year to prospective health care workers from the Philippines and Indonesia. A one-year extension was given in 2011 and 2013, which a Japanese official said has helped boost the overall pass rate. The latest extension applies to 93 nurses and caregivers from Indonesia who arrived in Japan in fiscal 2012 and 300 Filipino and Indonesian candidate nurses and caregivers who arrived in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2013, the pass rate for the nursing exam was 10.6 percent, while 36.3 percent of candidates passed the caregiver test. The move will benefit those who failed the exams but were able to meet certain conditions such as having relatively good scores in the last qualifying exams they took. Under the bilateral deals, the current length of stay for prospective nurses is three years and that of caregivers is four years. The candidates must pass the exams within the designated period or leave. New candidates arriving in Japan take language lessons for six months as well as on-the-job training. Candidate nurses are given three chances to take the exams, but caregivers only one. An extension makes it possible for prospective nurses to sit the test four times and caregivers twice. Around 2,200 trainees have so far come to Japan from the two Southeast Asian countries under the agreements.",

Deputy Foreign Minister Shinsuke Sugiyama and his Russian counterpart, Igor Morgulov, discussed the long-running territorial dispute and prospects for a post-World War II peace pact, Japanese officials said. After Japan’s surrender in World War II, the Soviet Union seized three small islands and a group of small islets off Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido. The dispute over their sovereignty has prevented Japan and Russia from concluding a peace treaty. Sugiyama and Morgulov skipped discussions on a postponed visit to Russia by Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, the officials said. Russia has taken the position that a Kishida visit, which was put off following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in southern Ukraine last March, must precede a Putin visit to Japan. Sugiyama and Morgulov also discussed the crisis in Ukraine and international terrorist activities, including those involving Islamic State, with Sugiyama conveying Japan’s position that sanctions imposed on Russia by Japan, European countries and the United States should not adversely affect Japan-Russia relations. The deputy minister-level meeting, initially set for last August, was postponed after Japan imposed additional sanctions following the Crimea annexation. The previous meeting was held in January 2014.",

    "source": "Japanese are quick to embrace robots <eos> “Hello and welcome. I can tell you about money exchange, ATMs, opening a bank account or overseas remittance. Which one would you like?” This greeting is not uttered by a human employee but, instead, a diminutive robot named Nao. Just 58 cm tall, the humanoid will be deployed on a trial basis at one or two branches of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. in April to help customers with their enquiries. It — I’m really struggling not to say “she” — is just one of an increasing number of robots working in customer-service positions in Japan. By the time foreign visitors arrive in Tokyo for the Olympic Games in 2020, these multilingual robots may well be commonplace. Nestle Japan, for example, has unveiled plans to employ SoftBank’s emotion-sensing robot called Pepper to sell its coffee machines at up to 1,000 outlets by the end of the year. So does Nao and her — I mean, its — robot compatriots signal a significant change in robot intelligence? I’ve written before about how robots are more easily assimilated into society in Japan than in the West. Many put this down to the fact that Japan has been founded on Shintoism and, as a result, the lack of spiritual distinction between animate and inanimate objects means people in Japan don’t have problems accepting robots as living entities. In other words, Japanese folk simply aren’t weirded out by robots. This has fascinating implications for how we decide whether advanced machines can think, or even pretend to think. It’s something that a lot of scientists spend a lot of time wondering about, the heart of which can be traced back to the Turing test. Conceived by computer scientist Alan Turing in the 1950s, the test recognized that a computer could have the ability to “think” if a human interrogator couldn’t tell it apart from another person through conversation. The test has since become something of a sport, with tournaments evaluating the trickiness of computer programs in passing themselves off as human beings. Last year, Eugene Goostman — purportedly a teenager from Ukraine but, in fact, a piece of software called a chatbot — made headlines when it supposedly passed the Turing test. It hadn’t — it was just very good at chatting — but it won’t be long until a machine becomes so good at chatting that we may be forced to accept that thing as a real person. I don’t think we’re far away — at least not emotionally. I already find myself wanting to refer to the robot Nao as a female. Many Japanese who currently spend a lot of time with robots — and here I’m thinking particularly of people in hospitals and care homes — tend to refer to them affectionately and add the suffix “ chan ” when talking to or about their robots. Let’s say technology improves to a point where we can say that robots really do seem to be thinking, and not just chatting about hamsters (one of Eugene’s favorite subjects) but properly thinking. No doubt we will form bonds with these machines. The question then becomes: If these machines are good enough to really mimic human thought, should they be considered humans and, if so, should they possess the same rights as us? Funnily enough, these very issues are currently being explored by writers and directors as well as neuroscientists worldwide. Alex Garland’s “Ex Machina” tackles precisely this issue. The U.K. writer, who wrote “The Beach” in the 1990s before going on to write screenplays for “28 Days Later” and Kazuo Ishiguro’s “Never Let Me Go,” makes his directorial debut with a film that really only has three characters: Caleb, Nathan and Ava. Caleb’s a coder who wins a chance to spend a week at a house belonging to his billionaire boss, Nathan, to take part in an unusual kind of Turing test. Unusual, it transpires, is a bit of an understatement. The machine attempting to pass itself off as human is Ava — a devastatingly sexy robot. This is no mere humanoid, but a full-on gynoid — a female android — with curves in the right places and a beautiful face. The film’s title derives, of course, from the Latin “deus ex machina,” which means “the god from the machine.” While Ava is an unusual machine to use in a regular Turing test, her depiction reflects the all-too-familiar way feminized robots are portrayed in film. In such movies, gynoids are almost always sexbots. Check out the character of Motoko Kusanagi in the anime “Ghost in the Shell.” (The movie is currently being remade in Hollywood, starring Scarlett Johansson.) You might even remember that the female replicant in “Blade Runner,” Pris, is also a sexbot — albeit one who can turn violent in a heartbeat. “Ex Machina” recalls “Blade Runner” in several ways, not least the way a male character is asked to interrogate a beautiful female character to determine if she is “real” or not. Is Ava a conscious human being? Is she a very good simulation of consciousness, or does she have that “extra spark” that humans have? And in a sentence, I hope it’s clear what blind alleys the study of consciousness can lead us down. I don’t think there is an “extra spark” that differentiates humanity from machines — a robot smart enough to fake consciousness might as well be considered to be conscious. In “Ex Machina,” Caleb queries the setup of the Turing test he has to perform on Ava (the machine is hidden from view in a normal Turing test, but here the robot is in plain sight). Yes, says Nathan. He is so confident of Ava’s intelligence that he feels he can reveal the fact that she is a robot. I won’t give away what happens, but I wonder if intelligent robots are poised to be embraced in Japan before anywhere else in the world, not only because of the country’s proven prowess in robotics but because its people are more ready to accept the machines.",

    "source": "Winter offers a wake-up call for local revitalization drive <eos> Kansai’s corporate titans gathered in Kyoto earlier this month for their annual retreat, formally known as the Kansai Economic Forum. While there was no shortage of the usual slightly daft old men with slightly daft ideas, this year saw two important, positive changes. The first was that the old men decided they were tired of critics banging on about the lack of women in what has always been an old boys’ club. At this year’s forum, in the conference rooms and in front of the smoked salmon buffet tables, women were far more visible. The second change was an unprecedented sense of urgency in addressing issues the good ol’ boys (and girls) have long worried about: a declining population, especially in rural areas, a Tokyo-centric economy and local economic revitalization. Longstanding concerns such as the declining birthrate and aging society, as well as an intense concentration of people in the Tokyo region and what it means for Japan’s future economy, are finally getting some attention. Local governments from Okinawa to Hokkaido have tried to solve the problems by giving away land, offering tax credits to young families and firms, and concocting all manner of PR schemes to convince people to abandon the urban rat race and enjoy a higher quality of life in their locality. These and countless other programs to keep younger Japanese in particular from running off to Tokyo or, less so, Kansai have failed. The reasons for the continued migration of people to urban areas, particularly Tokyo, are said to be economical. Or political. Or cultural. All true. But there is another, less obvious, reason neither Kansai’s corporate mandarins nor local politicians mentioned: the weather, and modern attitudes toward it. The Kansai Economic Forum took place on a day when the national media squawked that the sky was, quite literally, falling in Tokyo — specifically, 3 cm of snow. If you’re from snow country, you might snicker at such reports. If you’re not from snow country (i.e. from Tokyo or Osaka), however, that’s reason for panic. For such people, snow is as scary as heavy rain and cold wind. It makes a mess of designer-label clothing and expensive hairdos. It turns shiny tile floors into slippery zones where you might break an arm. It means trains to and from work might be delayed or canceled. And then there’s the fact houses in Kanto and Kansai are not constructed for bone-cold weather. People from Hokkaido are often shocked to discover the well-insulated homes they grew up in are in short supply down south. No wonder in Osaka, once the temperature drops below 15 degrees Celsius (not Fahrenheit), the phrase most often heard is meccha samui (“It’s really cold”). Traditional Japanese art and literature may celebrate the four seasons, but modern advertising mostly prefers selling spring’s cherry blossoms, the hot summer sun and autumn’s leaves. No wonder few in Kansai or Tokyo can envision life, as opposed to a weekend ski trip, in winter. Local governments themselves have also failed to convey to potential residents the real lifestyles of those living outside uber-convenient and comparatively mild Tokyo and Kansai. PR materials abound with glossy photos of smiling villagers enjoying bucolic lifestyles — in spring, summer and fall, that is. Winter, if it is mentioned, is a magical world in white under deep blue skies. Nice — if the intent is to attract tourists. But as long as policies for rural revitalization and decentralization from Tokyo fail to address legitimate concerns about the realities of life in weather conditions different from Tokyo and Osaka, no one should expect them to succeed.",

    "source": "Where's the beef? Kyoto looks to carve out global niche <eos> The quintessential tourist image of Kyoto cuisine is one of a refined “bento” (boxed lunch) containing all sorts of small treats, but heavy on fish, tofu and vegetables, with much attention devoted to presentation and tastes that are sublime, but not overpowering. Certain Kyoto vegetables like “kujo negi” green onion form the base of many local dishes, while Kyoto tofu is famous throughout the country for its quality. But one food item not traditionally associated with Kyoto is beef. While Kobe beef is world famous and along with Omi and Matsuzaka beef is considered Japan’s finest, sparking spirited debates among fussy foodies over the merits of each, the idea of visiting a Kyoto restaurant for a thick steak, or even an excellent “shabu-shabu” or sukiyaki dinner with local beef, is not yet on the tourist list of must-do things while in the ancient capital. Kyoto Prefecture, however, is now trying to make “Kyoto Beef” into a brand name worldwide. Earlier this month, for the first time ever, about 500 kg of top quality beef from Kyoto was sent to Singapore as part of a trade promotion fair. “We chose Singapore because Kyoto Beef is expensive and Singapore has a lot of wealthy diners, as well as a large Japanese ex-pat community. A local Japanese restaurant offered a number of traditional Kyoto and Japanese-style lunch and dinner sets featuring not only local beef but also kujo negi, a traditional Japanese green onion or scallion associated with Kyoto, as well as Kyoto pickles and Kyoto ‘macha’ (green tea) ice cream,” said Koichi Kamimura, a prefectural agricultural official involved in promoting Kyoto Beef. How did the beef go over with Singapore’s diners? “People said they liked it because it was slightly sweet,” he said. The recent decision to market Kyoto prefectural beef as Kyoto Beef overseas is mostly to avoid confusion. There are, in fact, several names for beef from cows born and raised in Kyoto. The highest and most expensive grade of beef is simply “Kyoto Niku,” which rivals Matsuzaka and Kobe beef in terms of quality and cost. Then there is “Kyo no Niku,” using the old kanji for “capital.” It’s not certified as the highest grade but is still considered premium. Then there is “Tanba-gyu,” or beef from the Tanba region of the prefecture, and “Kameoka-gyu,” from the Kameoka region. Both types of beef can be bought for about half of what the other two cost. Finally, there is “Kyotankuro wagyu.” “It’s difficult for people overseas to get a fixed image of what Kyoto Beef is with all of the different names for Kyoto-area beef, In order to build an easily understandable brand abroad, we decided to call it all Kyoto Beef,” Kamimura said. For meat to be certified as Kyoto Beef, it must come from cows that were bred in Kyoto and raised there for most of their lives. It must also be certified as one of four top grades by the Japan Meat Grading Association. Like Kobe, Omi and Matsuzaka beef, Kyoto Beef is closely monitored and production history records are kept, allowing one to trace the lineage of a particular head of cattle. The next overseas promotion event will be in March, at the Mitsuwa Marketplace in Torrance, California. But domestically, the push is just getting started, although the plan is to target luxury hotels, especially international hotels, and the city’s top restaurants. “The idea is to present Kyoto Beef as part of traditional Japanese dishes, though we have to keep in mind how beef is eaten overseas,” Kamimura said. While Kyoto’s brand name image and recognition give it a competitive advantage over other prefectures also trying to expand beef sales, a limited supply means the marketing strategy will focus not only on quality of taste but also exclusivity. The latter effort is not only a marketing choice but also a practical necessity. The Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Ministry’s most recent data show there are about 2.5 million head of beef cattle nationwide. Hokkaido, with just over half a million cattle, ranks at the top. Hyogo Prefecture, the home of Kobe beef, only has about 52,000 head of cattle, while Mie Prefecture, where Matsuzaka beef comes from, has only 26,700 head. Shiga Prefecture, known for its “Omi beef,” has 17,200 head. Kyoto Prefecture, however, has just under 6,700, making beef from Kyoto rare domestically, let alone overseas. The other aspect of international promotion, one likely to resonate in countries where meat safety inspection standards are not as tough as Japan’s, focuses on assuring customers Kyoto Beef is extremely safe from disease. On the other hand, health-conscious consumers, especially in the United States or Europe, may have concerns about Kyoto Beef, especially those cuts with a much higher fat content than beef from their own countries to which they are accustomed. But unlike the somewhat exaggerated and sometimes patently untrue lore surrounding Kobe beef about beer dinners and tummy massages, Kyoto cattle don’t have a particularly unique, Kyoto-type diet. “We don’t feed the cattle things like kujo negi or tofu, although the feed mixture is probably not something the ranchers want to publicize too loudly,” said Kamimura.",

    "source": "Kyoto's tourism boom spells war for luxury hotel chains <eos> Kyoto’s recent record-setting tourism boom has sparked a mini-“hotel war,” with some of the world’s best-known luxury inn chains opening branches in the ancient capital, as its international popularity as a travel destination spreads even further. Not too many years ago, Kyoto had a dearth of international first-class hotels. Visitors found a choice of domestic chains, some of which were run-down, with dark lobbies and moldy carpets in the lobby, and dirty, small rooms with hard beds. Or they could opt for a traditional evening in an ancient Japanese-style inn that cost far more and offered a cultural experience, but often lacked modern amenities that today’s international travelers demand. But one year ago, the Ritz Carlton opened, quickly earning accolades from tourists as well as long-time, slightly jaded Japanese and foreign residents as the place in Kyoto to be seen, either as a guest or simply as a customer in one of the bars or restaurants. The Ritz Kyoto, however, is expected to be joined by yet another high-end international hotel next spring, when the Four Seasons Kyoto is scheduled to open in the Higashiyama district. That’s not too far from the Hyatt Regency Kyoto, which opened back in 2006. These are joined by several smaller, luxury boutique hotels run by both Japanese and international resort chains that have opened in recent years or have announced plans to do so. The arrival of top-grade hotels comes as Kyoto’s reputation as a destination for domestic and international tourists continues to grow. Last year, the city was named by the U.S. magazine Travel + Leisure as the World’s best city, beating out Charleston, South Carolina, and Florence, Italy. In 2013, more than 51 million people visited Kyoto, according to municipal figures. More than 13 million people stayed in hotels in the city that same year, a 7 percent increase over 2012. In total, tourists spent just over ¥700 billion. One of the largest increases was recorded in the numbers of foreign tourists. About 1.13 million visited Kyoto in 2013, a 35 percent increase over the previous year. Tourists from Taiwan, the United States, China, Australia and France accounted for over 55 percent of the total, with Taiwanese, at 20.8 percent, the largest group. The news, the city says, is expected to be as good or better once the 2014 figures come out. “Overall, Kyoto tourism has been increasing these past few years, and 2013 was a record year for the number of visitors. We expect the overall upward tend to continue for 2014,” said Nobuo Hatanaka, a Kyoto municipal tourism official.",

    "source": "Ranking priest, past pope-picked reform panelist arrested by Vatican over document leaks <eos> VATICAN CITY - The Vatican said Monday it had arrested a high-ranking priest and another member of a papal reform commission on suspicion of leaking confidential documents — a stunning move that comes just days before the publication of two books promising damaging revelations about the obstacles Pope Francis faces in cleaning up the Holy See’s murky finances. The developments threatened to become a new “Vatileaks” — the 2012 scandal that began with the publication of a blockbuster book by Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi detailing the corruption and mismanagement in the Holy See. The scandal ended with the conviction of Pope Benedict XVI’s butler — and Benedict’s resignation a year later. The latest arrests of two advisers hand-picked by Francis to help in his effort to overhaul Vatican finances threatened to further expose infighting and rifts surrounding the pope’s efforts at reform and a more open church. Monsignor Lucio Angel Vallejo Balda, a Spaniard, and Francesca Chaouqui, an Italian public relations executive, had served on a now-defunct financial reform commission set up by Francis in 2013 as part of his drive to clean house at the Vatican, especially in its scandal-tainted economic affairs. A Vatican statement said the arrests followed a months-long investigation and that the two had been interrogated over the weekend. It said Vallejo Balda was being held in a jail cell in Vatican City, while Chaouqui was released Monday because she was cooperating with the investigation. The Vatican’s statement stopped short of linking the latest leaks probe to the two potentially bombshell books that go on sale Thursday. But a clearly irritated Vatican contended publication of such expose works risk hurting Pope Francis’ cleanup drive. The Vatican described the books as “fruit of a grave betrayal of the trust given by the pope, and, as far as the authors go, of an operation to take advantage of a gravely illicit act of handing over confidential documentation.” “Publications of this nature do not help in any way to establish clarity and truth, but rather generate confusion and partial and tendentious conclusions,” the Vatican said, noting that “the leaking of confidential information and documents is a crime” under a law enacted in the first months of Francis’ papacy. Nuzzi’s 2012 best-seller, “His Holiness,” based on leaked papal correspondence detailing corruption, infighting and intrigue in the Vatican, has been cited by some as inspiring Benedict XVI’s stunning resignation from the papacy in 2013. According to the publishers, Nuzzi’s new book, “Merchants in the Temple: Inside Pope Francis’s Secret Battle Against Corruption in the Vatican,” promises to reveal “heretofore untold, unbelievable stories of scandal and corruption at the highest levels.” “A veritable war is waging in the Catholic Church,” a news release quotes Nuzzi as saying. “On one side, there is Pope Francis’ strong message for one church of the poor” and on the other, “there is the opaque and aggressive power systems within the Vatican’s hierarchy.” The other book, “Avarice: Documents Revealing Wealth, Scandals and Secrets of Francis’ Church,” is by Italian journalist Emiliano Fittipaldi. He writes for L’Espresso newsweekly, which has published some of the most damaging leaks of Francis’ papacy, including most recently a letter by 13 cardinals warning Francis about his family synod. According to the publisher, Fittipaldi’s book maps out the church’s financial empire, from the luxurious lives of the cardinals to the big businesses of Catholic-run hospitals in Italy. Speaking Monday to Italy’s Repubblica TV, Fittipaldi said his book “doesn’t talk about Francis, but about a church that seems very distant from the mottoes of the pope.” He said it was his understanding that the arrested pair had been accused of leaking “news for my book and that of my colleague,” Nuzzi. While Francis is intent on modernizing the Vatican and making its finances more transparent, the arrests were the latest confirmation that scandal and intrigue still swirl, as they have for centuries, through the largely closed world of the Vatican’s administrative bureaucracy. Elected on a mandate from his fellow cardinals to reform the Vatican’s bureaucracy and bring order to its haphazard finances, Francis in 2013 created the commission Vallego Balda and Chaouqui served on to gather information from all Vatican offices to try to shed light on the Holy See’s overall financial situation and end an entrenched culture of mismanagement, opaqueness and waste. Francis named the Maltese financier Joseph Zahra to head the commission and Vallejo Balda as his No. 2. Chaouqui was named one of the six other commission members. The commission was given broad powers to solicit information from traditionally independent Vatican offices that were none too pleased to divulge their assets to a group of outsiders, regardless of their papal mandate. But the commission did its job, coming into possession of thousands of pages of information, such as the existence of “secret” accounts held by the Secretariat of State that had never figured into the Vatican’s consolidated balance sheets. That two of the commission members now stand accused of leaking documents is a remarkable new chapter in the Vatileaks saga, but it’s unclear if the investigation will stop with them. The 33-year-old Chaouqui, who favors slim-fitting jeans and long, bouncy hairdos, cut a figure in sharp contrast to the more somber dress of the relatively few laywomen with roles at the Vatican. She is being defended by Giulia Bongiorno, one of Italy’s top criminal lawyers who won acquittal for Amanda Knox’s co-defendant in their internationally watched murder trial. Opus Dei, the conservative Catholic religious movement, expressed “surprise and pain” over Vallejo Balda’s arrest, who it described as belonging to a priestly society linked to Opus Dei. If the allegation turns out to be proven, it will be particularly painful because of the damage done to the church,” it said in a statement.",

The proposal, which a spokesman for Ariel said had been rejected after initial consultations within the Agriculture Ministry, was roundly criticized by animal rights activists and bemused opposition politicians. “No way am I going to apply for a foreign passport for Pitzkeleh,” former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni tweeted above a photo showing the smiling Zionist Union party politician reclining on a sofa and feeding her cat. The newspaper report said Ariel, a religious Jew and a member of the far-right Jewish Home party, views spaying and neutering as possible violations of God’s directive “to be fruitful and multiply” and ritual law that prohibits animal cruelty.

    "source": "Does biometric authentication hold the key to a bright future or Pandora's box? <eos> Forgot your password? Maybe that won’t be an issue in the near future. As an alternative to traditional digital authentication that requires individuals to input numbers or phrases to prove their identity, biometric authentication, which uses people’s physical traits, has become an increasingly common feature, particularly in popular mobile devices. Because of its convenience and high degree of accuracy, the government believes such technology may be used to identify the holders of integrated circuit (IC) chip-equipped My Number cards, which will be distributed from January. But will biometric authentication replace passwords? This week’s FYI looks at the issue. What is biometric authentication? Biometric authentication is a digital identification method using the physical traits or behavioral habits of individuals to unlock devices or access personal information, according to the Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA), a government-affiliated IT security firm. By preregistering personal information on a computer database, individuals can verify their identity later by scanning a part of their body or demonstrating other personal traits, such as voice and walking style. As individuals do not have to carry keys or IC cards to verify their identity, biometric authentication can lower risks such as the loss or theft of keys. What are the major types of biometric authentication? The most well-known, cheapest biometric identification is fingerprint authentication, which is scanning the shape of a fingerprint pattern, according to the IPA. Other identification points include bifurcation (scanning the point in a finger image at which two ridges meet), dots, pores, ridges and islands. In all cases, a computer can compare the scanned image with information stored on its database to identify the user. Facial recognition is another increasingly popular ID method. It was recently introduced for the Windows 10 operating system as an option to log into a computer if the camera supports the feature. Users of facial recognition can verify their identity just by having a camera capture an image of their face. The image will allow a computer to identify the user based on information such as the distance between facial parts, shape of a face and skin color. Other types of biometric authentication include identifying a user’s iris, vein, voice, keyboard typing habits or even odor recognition. Is biometric authentication better than a password? Biometric authentication is more convenient than a password, but it’s not as safe as people might think. The biggest advantage of using biometric identification is it frees individuals from the burden of memorizing complicated passwords, said Rie Yamaguchi, a project associate professor at the University of Tokyo who researches digital security. Many people sacrifice security for convenience by setting simplistic phrases for their passwords. According to the latest “worst passwords” list released by U.S. security application company SplashData, compiled from 3.3 million leaked passwords in 2014, the most frequently used password was “123456,” followed by such simple phrases as “password,” “qwerty” and “baseball.” But in terms of security, “biometric authentication is not as secure as people think,” Yamaguchi said, adding it was actually easy for intruders to steal the biometric personal information stored on computer servers. For example, Tsutomu Matsumoto, a professor of information security at Yokohama National University, proved once that biometric fingerprints can be copied. He himself demonstrated how to do this by making fake fingers from gelatin and copying and pasting someone else’s fingerprints on them. The fake fingers passed the authentication test. Yamaguchi said is was therefore important to use different methods of identification for various situations, rather than just relying on one method. What does the future hold for biometric authentication? The market for biometric authentication technology is expected to grow rapidly in the next decade, as it has become increasingly popular among smartphone users. According to a forecast by American IT market intelligence firm Tractica announced in August, the global market for biometric technology will grow from $2.0 billion in 2015 to $14.9 billion by 2024. Although the technology itself is not new, biometric authentication became rapidly popular after it began to be installed on popular smartphones, Yamaguchi said. What are the concerns about biometric authentication? Privacy is a major concern. Mitsuru Kuroda, an adjunct lecturer at the Osaka University of Economics who teaches municipalities how to use IT, says leaks of biometric information could bring more harm than password breaches, because, unlike passwords, it is virtually impossible to change biometric information. Once an individual’s personal information falls into the hands of criminals, that person’s privacy will be permanently breached and the risk of identity theft increases, he added. Kuroda said it seemed contradictory to use such important private information to protect other private data, such as My Number. If the government decides to collect everyone’s biometric information for authentication purposes, this could result in “the ultimate surveillance society,” in which all individual activities can be recorded and monitored by the government, he warned.",

    "source": "Tokyo cancels U.N. freedom of expression expert's visit; supporters cite secrecy law scrutiny <eos> A U.N. expert in charge of freedom of expression said Thursday that the Japanese government has canceled the visit he was scheduled to make next month. David Kaye, U.N. special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, told Kyodo News he hopes he “can continue to work with the (Japanese) government” and that he has always had good interactions with it. The rare cancellation of the official visit drew criticism that the Japanese government is trying to hinder him from raising such issues as the secrecy law, which is aimed at preventing the leak of state secrets. Under the contentious law, which took effect last year, civil servants and others who leak designated secrets will face up to 10 years in prison, and those who “instigate” leaks — including journalists — will face prison terms of up to five years. “We will rearrange the schedule because we couldn’t make full preparations to accept the visit due to budget compilation and other reasons,” said a bureaucrat in the Foreign Ministry. “The government has said that they wanted to postpone the visit until the autumn,” Kaye said. The ministry declined to confirm the remark. Kaye announced his plans to visit Japan from Dec. 1 to 8 at the Third Committee of the U.N. General Assembly in October. He planned to conduct hearings with bureaucrats, journalists and citizen activists about information disclosure regarding the secrecy law and other topics related to freedom of expression in Japan, according to Kaye and lawyer Yuichi Kaido, who planned to support him during his trip, said. The U.N. Human Rights Committee expressed concerns about the secrecy law last year. In response to Friday’s cancellation request, Kaye urged the Japanese government to reconsider. But Tokyo notified him of the decision again on Tuesday, Kaye said. “Japan as a government and as a country is, generally speaking, very respectful of freedom of expression,” he said. “We look at things that are worth celebrating, perhaps as a model that other countries could follow,” the special rapporteur said, adding, “We also identify areas where there might be some concerns.”",

The profit, up 7 percent from a year ago, marks the central bank’s highest half-year figure since 2001. The BOJ started gobbling up state debt under the radical quantitative and qualitative ultra-easy monetary policy it launched in April 2013 and expanded in October 2014, in a bid to lift the world’s third-largest economy out of nearly two decades of deflation. The central bank’s total assets have thus ballooned 32.1 percent to a record ¥366.13 trillion, with JGBs accounting for ¥309.57 trillion of it, up 35 percent. Interest income from the JGB holdings meanwhile surged 23.8 percent to ¥639.1 billion, the BOJ said. But the bank’s appraisal gain on its foreign exchange holdings narrowed sharply to ¥27.2 billion from ¥305.5 billion in the same period last year, because the yen did not weaken as much in the period. The central bank’s capital adequacy ratio stood at 7.94 percent as of the end of September, down from 8.2 percent at the end of the previous March. The BOJ considers 8 percent a sound level.",

    "source": "TPP no done deal; hurdles include interpretation, legislative approval, U.S. election <eos> The full text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement was released this month. The document is a wide-ranging accord between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. Pushed hard by the United States as part of its efforts to compete with Chinese influence in Asia, the agreement is being hailed by its supporters as a victory for free markets and a rules-based economic system. Its detractors warn it has little to do with free trade, and is more of a corporate power grab that will harm ordinary workers and reduce the power of governments to address domestic health, environment and labor concerns. In Japan, the potential effects are now being debated in the Diet. Attention is focusing in particular on areas like agriculture, where much of the opposition originates. Following are questions and answers about the next steps for the TPP. Is the pact a done deal? Not at all. The TPP text released in early November says it is “subject to legal review in English, Spanish and French for accuracy, clarity and consistency.” This “legal scrubbing” will take time, and could create more political concern in the TPP member countries about just what, exactly, they are agreeing on, or if everybody is agreeing on the same thing. Second, and more importantly, the deal must be ratified by the legislatures of the member countries. In Japan, the government, business community and mainstream media strongly support the deal, but whether the Diet will approve the text before next summer’s Upper House election remains unclear. And the TPP agreement’s approval by the U.S. Congress is much less certain. Why is Congress worried? Some Japanese media and political figures say it stems from the opposition to the pact as stated by elements of the Democratic Party and the labor unions that support the party. But that’s only half the story. Opposition to the TPP in the U.S. is growing and crosses political boundaries because of what is included and what is not. Some worry not only about products like auto parts, but also how the TPP will affect the regulation of the Internet, the health care industry, rules of origin on products, and patents. Many Republicans are also opposed or skeptical because of last-minute concessions in areas like the length of time drug companies can protect their data and the agreement to exempt tobacco from a new international dispute resolution mechanism called Investor-State Dispute Settlement that makes it easier for corporations to sue governments over health issues. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican, has suggested the TPP will have to be renegotiated to pass Congress. What might Japan be required to renegotiate? Many in the U.S. Congress are concerned about the Japanese government manipulating its currency. They worry that while there is language in the negotiated text to prevent that, the enforcement mechanism is insufficient. This could become a stumbling block between Washington and Tokyo. However, economic revitalization minister Akira Amari, Japan’s lead negotiator, said last week it would be impossible to redo the agreement. Even if it clears Congress, what about the U.S. presidential election? The main candidates for the Democratic Party nomination, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders, have come out against the TPP, although there is great skepticism about Clinton’s position, as she has indicated dozens of times in the past she supported it. On the Republican side, of the 10 major candidates, Donald Trump, Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee are opposed, while Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and John Kasich have voiced support for the agreement. Others are still sitting on the fence. If the TPP is passed by the 12 legislatures, what does it mean for Japan? Given that the negotiated text and annexes run to over 5,000 pages and were just released, the full impact of the 30-chapter agreement on Japan is not yet clear. However, political and media attention has been on increased agricultural imports. Over the coming years, assuming there are no renegotiations, tariffs on nearly 1,900 agricultural products will be eliminated. This includes tariffs on items ranging from grapes, apples, oranges and tomato juice to margarine, ketchup and sherbet. Tariffs would be incrementally abolished mainly over a period six to 13 years after the TPP goes into effect. Other agricultural goods will see their tariffs reduced. The tariff for imported beef, currently at 38.5 percent, will fall to 9 percent 16 years after the TPP comes into force. Duties on pork will be reduced to ¥50 (42 cents) per kilogram over a decade from a maximum of ¥482. New nontariff import quotas will be created for rice from the U.S. and Australia, to be expanded to an annual total of 78,400 metric tons 13 years after the agreement takes effect, and there will be a low-tariff quota for milk powder and butter that will eventually be expanded to a volume equivalent to 70,000 tons of raw milk. While farmers and Japan’s domestic food industry remain concerned about agricultural imports, especially increased beef, pork, rice and dairy imports, the government has largely muted opposition by assuring farmers and businesses likely to be heavily affected by the TPP that they will receive various forms of assistance to soften the blow against cheaper foreign imports. What about other areas? Under the TPP’s rules of origin, up to 40 percent of an automobile’s parts could be manufactured in a non-TPP country like China, contain 40 percent Japanese-made parts and the rest would come from TPP countries like Malaysia, and be exported to the U.S. with preferential tariff treatment. On the other hand, under a new copyright agreement for TPP members, copyright protection has been extended from 50 years after an author’s death, for example, to 70 years. This means that works by Yukio Mishima, who died in 1970, will not become copyright-free until after 2040 instead of after 2020, while works by Yasunari Kawabata, who died in 1972, won’t be copyright-free until at least 2043.",

    "source": "Australian sets Christmas tree record with 518,838 lights <eos> CANBERRA - An Australian set his third Christmas-themed world record in as many years Friday by illuminating a tree in downtown Canberra with 518,838 twinkling lights. Guinness World Records confirmed that David Richards had broken the record for the most lights on an artificial Christmas tree that had been held for five years by Universal Studios Japan in Osaka. That 36-meter (118-foot) Japanese tree had set a new benchmark of 374,280 lights this month. Richards, a Canberra lawyer and businessman, brought together a team of volunteers including an electrical engineer, structural engineer, welders, carpenters, masons and steel fixers to erect the dazzling display on a 22-meter (72-foot) steel tree. Richards creates such Christmas extravaganzas to raise money for Canberra’s Sudden Infant Death Syndrome charity, SIDS and Kids, by drawing large crowds and inviting them to donate. “Some people say I’ve got quite a knack for getting people to do things for nothing,” Richards said. “I get people to do things for nothing because they know that I do things for nothing and I’m contributing my own money, resources, time and effort as well — so maybe they feel sorry for me,” he added. He set his first Guinness World Record in 2013 for the most lights on a residential property by covering his suburban home with 502,165 bulbs. Traffic snarls in his neighborhood created by 75,000 sightseers who visited the display over four weeks made it difficult for his family to get to and from their home and irritated some neighbors. So Richards promised never to try to better that record. He set his second record a year ago by stringing up 1,194,380 LED lights in a public space. The 120 kilometers (75 miles) of multicolored wire woven in the shape of three interconnected giant, wrapped Christmas gifts in a Canberra mall was the largest ever image made of LED lights. But records tumble fast in the competitive world of light displays. Richards’ 2014 record was smashed in June at a hotel in Myoko, Niigata Prefecture, by an image of a dragon comprising 1,529,103 lights. His 2013 record for lights at home was beaten within days by a family in LaGrangeville, New York, that decorated their home with 601,736 Christmas lights, reclaiming their 2012 record.",

    "source": "Why do we need a little bit on the side? <eos> Dear Alice, I have been wondering about something for a long time: Why is sashimi always served on those piles of stringy daikon radish? Has this always been the case? Does the daikon serve any purpose, or is it just there for decoration? Also, what the heck are you supposed to do with it? Eat it or leave it on the plate? James S., Tokyo Dear James, The finely sliced daikon that comes under or around slices of raw fish is called “ tsuma .” That’s actually a generic term that can be applied to any of the many edible garnishes used to embellish presentations of sashimi. Common examples are artfully carved carrot strips, tiny whole chrysanthemum flowers, red and green seaweeds, and finely sliced myoga , the flower buds of the ginger plant. Yet the piles of white radish are so ubiquitous that, for most people, “tsuma” is pretty much synonymous with daikon. And speaking of synonyms, you probably know that “tsuma” also means “wife,” and are wondering whether there’s a connection. One theory as to why sashimi garnishes are called what they are goes like this: A plate of raw fish is like a happy household, in which the sashimi (the “husband”) exists in harmony with the supportive yet subordinate garnishes (the “wife”). Perhaps, but there are telling differences in how the two words are written. The kanji for tsuma-meaning-garnishes includes the character for tsuma-meaning-wife, but with the addition of the “ koromo hen” radical for clothing. Written this way, the character also refers to the lower front panel of a kimono, which is read — you guessed it — “tsuma”! So a second theory, which I find more plausible, is that “tsuma,” written with the clothing radical, was applied to garnishes because it means something at the side or edge. Turning now to history, I put in a call to Ayao Okumura, a chef, food consultant and cookbook author with a special interest in how Japanese cooking developed. He explained that the custom of eating raw fish was actually introduced to Japan from China, and perhaps as early as during the Kamakura Period (1185-1333). At that time, the Chinese ate raw fish, including carp and sea bass, chopped into pieces and tossed with strongly flavored vegetables such as scallions and garlic. This was the way the Japanese initially consumed raw fish, too. The practice of eating raw fish died out in China, but only grew in popularity in Japan, although it remained a luxury only enjoyed by aristocrats. One of the oldest known cookbooks in Japan is the “Shijoryu Hochogaki.” It was written in 1489, in the middle of the Muromachi Period (1392-1573), and includes instructions on preparing raw fish for consumption. The fish should be very carefully sliced, then mixed with vinegar flavored with any number of possible variants. Examples given include salt, wasabi, ginger and a peppery leaf called date , which is a flowering plant in the buckwheat family. Those ingredients originally served important functions, according to Okumura. “Remember that this was in the days before refrigeration,” he said. “Highly flavored and aromatic ingredients were added to mask fishy tastes and smells. But they also slowed the rate of spoilage because, as we now know, many of these foods, and especially wasabi, contain natural anti-bacterial compounds.” The way we enjoy sashimi today — a presentation of plain slices of fish or shellfish that can be dipped in soy sauce to taste — was a much later development. “That style of eating raw fish didn’t come about until late in the Edo Period (1603-1868),” Okumura said. Instead of mixing the sauces and vegetables into the fish, sauces were offered in separate dishes on the side, and the vegetables and other edibles were placed under or around the fish. “As transportation and storage of fish improved, there was less need to mask odors and off tastes, so the original function of tsuma was lost,” Okumura said. “These days, tsuma are used only to make the presentation more attractive. The colors of the vegetables and seaweeds make the fish look more appetizing, and you can add a sense of the season by including seasonal flowers and plants.” There is, however, a new trend to use fewer tsuma, moving away from big, busy presentations. “The current thinking toward tsuma is that less is more,” Okumura commented. “We’re seeing less daikon, and a more measured use of other garnishes, too.” This reminds me of a colloquialism that seems to illustrate just how far tsuma have fallen since the glory days: The phrase “sashimi no tsuma” (“the garnish for sashimi”) can be used to mean someone or something is of little consequence. You can say, “ Kono ken ni tsuite, kare wa sashimi no tsuma no yōna mono da .” (“On this matter, he’s like the garnish for sashimi.”) This means the person’s input and opinion are unimportant, and there’s no reason to take them into account. But let’s get back to your final question: do you, or do you not, eat the daikon? Earlier this year, there was an online survey in which more 12,000 men and women offered their views. While some maintained it is a bad manners to down the decorations, and others said they won’t touch the daikon because it’s contaminated by blood from the fish, fully 76 percent of respondents said they do eat the tsuma. I thought it best to let Okumura have the final word. “It’s fine to eat the tsuma,” he assured me. “You might get a little extra nutrition, and you can certainly enjoy the different flavors and textures.” He did, however, add one caveat: “Just don’t eat the whole chrysanthemum flowers. The petals are fine, and are often used in fall dishes, but they really should be lightly boiled first.” Notice Sadly, this is the final installment of this column, which has run since 2005; Alice Gordenker has decided she needs to focus on other work.

Former President Bill Clinton started the tradition in 1993, when he handed out leather bomber jackets similar to those worn by American fighter pilots.

    "source": "Without tackling Japan's labor mismatch, Abe's GDP target is just a pipe dream <eos> In September, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that the government’s economic goal is to boost gross domestic product to ¥600 trillion in 2020. Most members of the business community have called this target impossible, since it would require an annual growth rate of 3 percent, and the last time Japan achieved that figure was in 1991. Japan would have to add ¥110 trillion to its economy to achieve the government’s target, and to do that Japan needs to add several million people to the workforce. Earlier this month a government panel of academics and business leaders recommended that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party accelerate the planned ¥18 yearly increase in the minimum wage. The conventional wisdom about raising wages is that it tends to reduce employment, though in the United States there have been recent examples that seem to contradict this economic truism. Some companies in Seattle, for instance, have already raised their hourly wage to $15 an hour ahead of a local law that sets that amount as the minimum wage for “large businesses” within the next four years, and unemployment has actually gone down, though some economists say it has nothing to do with pay. In any event, there’s no way Japan can boost GDP without expanding its workforce. The good news is that there is a surplus of job openings compared to the number of job seekers. The bad news is that there is a mismatch between the positions available and the people who are looking for jobs. In many instances it has to do with training or experience. There are not enough people with the skills necessary to fill many of the empty positions. A bigger problem is that the available jobs are not the kind that the majority of job seekers want, because of either the nature of the work or the employment conditions. An article in the Sept. 28 issue of Toyo Keizai explains that construction and social welfare are the fields that need workers the most. Building and public works projects started decreasing in number in the late ’90s, and as older workers retired, fewer new ones were hired and trained. Since the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011, construction demand has increased, but there is a serious lack of skilled workers. The labor ministry estimates that at the moment the industry needs another 500,000, and since more than 20 percent of the current construction workforce is over 60, a decade from now the shortage will expand to 1 million unless more workers are added in the meantime. In the social welfare field — nursing, caregiving, day care—the welfare ministry projects that 2.53 million people will be needed by 2025, and that at the current rate there will only be about 2.15 million. The main problem is low pay and the demands of the job, which combine to result in high turnover. Caregivers quit because they don’t think the remuneration is worth the hard work. Besides, there are other jobs available. Another field suffering from a shortage of labor is delivery services. More than 100,000 drivers are needed nationwide, and courier companies target caregivers since many caregivers have to travel to patients’ homes and thus already have drivers licenses. These companies also know that caregivers tend to be frustrated with their work, and while they don’t necessarily pay them more, the work is relatively easier. In this situation, however, workers are simply being moved from one field to another. They aren’t adding to the total workforce, so the overall economy doesn’t benefit. Another problem is so-called career blanks: workers who have skills but leave the job market for personal reasons and don’t return. The Labor Policy Research Center estimates there are something like 10 million career blanks in Japan. A fair portion are nurses who quit to get married and have children and decide not to return to work afterward. Another difficult demographic is men or women who quit their regular employment to care for elderly parents full-time, but because they tend to leave their jobs in middle age, their prospects for re-entering the job market are low. In a Reuters survey of major Japanese companies, 76 percent supported the idea of “using foreign laborers,” but the government has consistently resisted the call to allow more immigrants into Japan to fill labor needs. Consequently, it will have to persuade more Japanese to enter the workforce, and the only demographics available in any large numbers are women, the elderly and disabled persons. Abe is now advocating a program that will help workers whose parents require extensive care so that these workers don’t have to quit their jobs but, more significantly, the government should encourage companies to hire and even retrain middle-aged and retired people who don’t work at the moment. But it’s women who could make the biggest difference, especially in fields that require manual labor, like construction. The problem is mainly structural, despite the government’s claim that it is giving more women opportunities. Ever since equality in the workplace was guaranteed by law in 1985, women have been channeled into nonregular employment though revisions in the labor laws that satisfy corporate demand for cheaper workers. Right now, 70 percent of all nonregular employees in Japan are women. On the one hand, many of these women are homemakers who only work part time and purposely limit their hours so that they don’t make more than ¥1.03 million a year. If they make above that amount, they no longer qualify as dependent exemptions for income tax purposes and will also lose their type 3 status, meaning they will have to start contributing to social security plans. On the other hand, women who do want to work full time disproportionately prefer office work. According to the Mitsubishi UFJ Research Institute, there are 3.24 million women looking for regular employment and 1.22 million looking for part-time employment as ippan jimu (general office workers), but there are only openings for about a quarter of these women, which means 3.35 million won’t be able to secure their “desired” positions. The trick is to somehow channel this huge labor potential into fields that are desperate for workers, but that will take a concerted effort on the part of government and industry to not only retrain these women and make pay and working conditions more attractive, but also to convince them that women can be just as effective as men in jobs that men have traditionally filled.",

Vice Adm. Kevin Donegan, commander of the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet, made the comments during an interview with The Associated Press at the opening day of the Dubai Airshow. He was careful not to underplay the significance of Tehran’s willingness to come to the negotiating table to hammer out a deal completed in July that gives it broad sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. But he noted that other actions such as attempts to smuggle military equipment to Yemen and harassing ships transiting the Gulf continue just as they did before the agreement. “We’re still concerned about Iran’s behavior overall. Positive about the nuclear agreement, but concerned … about some of their malign behavior related to other things unrelated to the nuclear issue,” he said. Aside from the nuclear negotiations, “I don’t know that we’ve seen a change in behavior,” he added, speaking aboard a P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane on display at the biennial show. Donegan, a former Navy fighter pilot and aircraft carrier commander, took over as head of the 5th Fleet in September. The naval force is based in the tiny Gulf island kingdom of Bahrain, just off the coast of Saudi Arabia. It is responsible for operations in a 2.5 million-sq.-mile area that includes the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway wedged between Iran and Oman that is the route for nearly a third of all oil traded by sea. In September, a ship assigned to a multinational naval force led by the 5th Fleet commander intercepted a vessel carrying anti-tank missiles and other equipment believed to be from Iran. That seizure came months after the U.S. sent an aircraft carrier and guided missile cruiser to the Arabian Sea amid concerns that a convoy of Iranian cargo ships was sending combat vehicles and other military equipment to Shiite rebels in Yemen. “We don’t think that was the only shipment that was working its way to Yemen,” Donegan said. He declined to elaborate. Iran acknowledges supporting the Yemeni rebels but denies it provides them any military aid. In the run-up to the nuclear deal, Iranian forces seized a Marshall Islands-flagged cargo ship, claiming that the shipping company that chartered it owed money to an Iranian firm. Days after it was released, an Iranian naval patrol opened fire on a Singapore-flagged commercial ship in the Persian Gulf. That incident was apparently linked to a financial dispute stemming from damage to an Iranian oil platform. U.S. Navy ships continue to face occasional harassment from Iranian patrols, Donegan said. While most encounters with the Iranians are professional, they occasionally get too close in ways that are “unsafe,” he said. “The behavior we’ve seen is about what we’ve come to expect,” he said. “They’ll like to intercept our ships, especially the combatants, as they’re going through the straits or in other places in the Gulf. They like to show that they can shoot weapons when they’re in proximity.” In the heavily trafficked Strait of Hormuz, Iranian vessels have occasionally approached commercial ships passing through and told them they must fly an Iranian flag to ensure their safe passage, Donegan added. For the first time since 2007, the United States has no aircraft carrier stationed in the Gulf. The last one left several weeks ago, and a replacement is not due until late this year. The Navy says maintenance needs after several years of heavy reliance on its carrier fleet and longer-than-usual deployments are to blame for the gap in coverage. Donegan said the U.S. can manage without a carrier for the time being even as it continues to handle the bulk of coalition airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, though he acknowledged he “wouldn’t want sustain this for a long period.” U.S. Air Force and other military aircraft are stationed around the Gulf, Turkey and elsewhere in the region. The USS Kearsarge, an amphibious assault ship that resembles a small aircraft carrier and has planes and helicopters, also operates in the theater. Donegan insisted that the temporary lack of a carrier is not a signal of the U.S. pulling back from the region — a growing fear among Washington’s Gulf Arab allies. “I don’t think that anyone who looks at it too deeply is going to say that in any way we’re leaving. Quite the contrary,” he said. “We’re here, and you can expect us to stay.”",

    "source": "Attorney group to offer free advice to ID-less 'mukoseki' citizens <eos> Japan’s attorneys are planning a wide-scale effort to advise people trapped in mukoseki status who are deprived of basic government services because they do not appear on family registries and thus lack legal identity. In response to a government request, the Japan Federation of Bar Associations will conduct a free, daylong toll-free advice session Wednesday, followed by a wider nationwide response through its regional bar association network. For the Wednesday session, which will be provided from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., callers with issues related to lack of family registration status will be connected to attorneys in their area who can advise them. People without a family registry are ineligible for passports and driver’s licenses, as well as such basic but critical services as public health insurance and national pension benefits. In addition, their lack of a legally valid identity leaves them open to a multitude of other potential problems. As of Oct. 10, there were 677 such people, 123 of them adults, based on cases reported to the Justice Ministry. A baby can fall into mukoseki limbo upon birth if it is fathered by the new partner of a woman who had divorced in the past 300 days. This can happen if she decides not to log the child’s birth in her family registry to circumvent a Civil Code law that deems a baby born in that period as the legal offspring of her former husband. Reluctance to contact a husband who was abusive can also contribute to such a debilitating decision. Critics blame the so-called 300-day rule for aggravating the situation. “The Justice Ministry figure is only the tip of the iceberg,” said Masae Ido, a former Lower House lawmaker who heads a mukoseki support group. She said there must be at least 10,000 people languishing in a mukoseki limbo, based on Supreme Court statistics. “The government should try to grasp the exact number of people who are in a mukoseki status and find out about why they remain in such a legal limbo,” she said.",

    "source": "Stress test to join annual health checks as mental problems rise in corporate Japan <eos> In light of the nationwide rise in mental health problems, the Industrial Safety and Health Law was revised last year to oblige companies to offer annual “stress checks” to employees starting Tuesday. Here are some details on the impact the new test is expected have on companies and employees, what it involves, and the factors that led to its introduction. Are work-related mental disorders on the rise? Yes, worker compensation claims are on the rise. In fiscal 2014, a record 1,456 people claimed compensation for poor mental health, according to the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry, up from 1,181 in fiscal 2010. A health ministry questionnaire in 2013 found 10 percent of the 9,026 responding businesses said they had employees who had taken more than a month’s leave or quit because of poor mental health the previous year, up from 8.1 percent in 2012. Although the national suicide rate has been declining since 2009, 2,323 of the 27,283 suicides reported in 2013 were blamed on work-related problems, the 2014 white paper on suicide prevention said. The number of work-related suicides, however, stayed relatively stable from 2007 to 2013. What is the economic impact of mental disorders? A study released in 2010 by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research said cases of suicide and depression caused about ¥2.7 trillion in economic losses for Japan in 2009. In 2008, the Cabinet Office estimated that it would cost a company about ¥4.22 million to let an employee in his late 30s making about ¥6 million a year take a six-month leave of absence because of poor mental health. What is the purpose of the test? The primary aim is to minimize mental health problems in the workforce. It also is designed to help improve working environments, which in turn will presumably help prevent people from having breakdowns , according to the ministry. “The government has at last put in place a necessary law to cope with the working environment, where stress abounds,” said Kazuo Koiwa, a certified social insurance labor consultant who is familiar with the test. Koiwa said the mental health checkup will prompt companies to take care of employees’ mental health and help raise workers’ awareness of their psychological condition. How does the checkup work? Businesses with more than 50 employees will be required to offer the checks once a year, which means it will cover some 18,000 businesses and reportedly more than 20 million employees nationwide. All employees, including part-timers, will be urged to take the test, although it is not mandatory. Businesses will have the option of creating their own questionnaire covering three areas: causes of stress in the workplace, symptoms of stress, and personal relationships. They will also have the option of using the questionnaire made by the health ministry, which has 57 questions covering the three areas. For causes of stress in the workplace, the ministry’s test includes the question phraseology options: “I have an extremely large amount of work to do,” “My job requires a lot of physical work” and “The atmosphere in my workplace is friendly.” The test-takers response options will range from “very much so” and “moderately so” to “somewhat” and “not at all.” On symptoms of stress, the ministry’s test phrases include: “I have been lively,” “I have felt exhausted” and “I have been unable to concentrate.” The answer options include: “almost never,” “sometimes,” “often” and “almost always.” In the relationships section, one question asks how freely one can speak with superiors, colleagues, spouses and other family members. How will employees learn of the test results? The doctors or nurses who assess the tests will directly inform them. Since the medical professionals will be obliged to maintain confidentiality, they will be barred from notifying the test-takers’ employers of the results without formal consent. If test-takers are assessed as under heavy stress, they can see a doctor at their request. Based on the advice of the interviewing doctors, employers will be required to improve the situation, such as by reducing work hours or arranging transfers. Are there any concerns about the tests? Koiwa pointed out that the tests, which are not mandatory, won’t work if employees are reluctant to take them. “Companies need to show positive attitudes toward creating better working environments, while encouraging employees to take the test,” Koiwa said. A recent survey has shown that companies are being slow in preparing for the annual test. The survey by job information provider en-Japan Inc. in October said 49 percent of the 231 responding firms said they are getting ready to introduce the tests, 33 percent remain unprepared, and 5 percent have no plans for preparations. Of the companies preparing to introduce the tests, 36 percent expected the checkup to have little effect. An advertising and publishing industry source said companies expect to gain little from the tests in comparison with costs of introducing them, adding there might be other ways of safeguarding employees’ mental health. An official at a manufacturer said they are not yet sure how the results of the tests will be of use.",

    "source": "Fate of troubled Monju reactor hangs in the balance <eos> After decades of repeated troubles, the Monju prototype fast-breeder reactor is at a crossroads. Earlier this month, the Nuclear Regulation Authority lodged its first official request with the education and science ministry to find a new entity to replace the government-backed Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) to operate the trouble-plagued facility in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture. The ministry has been given about six months to find a replacement. If it fails to do so, the NRA asked the ministry to conduct a fundamental rethink of Monju’s status, which, pundits say, could lead to its decommissioning. Following are questions and answers about the accident-prone research facility that was completed in April 1991 but has remained, except for brief operational interludes, effectively idled since then. What is Monju? It is Japan’s sole prototype fast-breeder reactor, designed to produce more plutonium fuel than it consumes to generate electricity. Once touted as a “dream reactor,” Monju is the central component of the country’s nuclear fuel cycle program aimed at resolving the nation’s shortage of natural energy sources. The plan has been to extract plutonium and uranium from spent nuclear fuel and reprocess them into plutonium-uranium mixed oxide (MOX) fuel to be reused at the fast-breeder and other nuclear reactors. Had Monju worked according to plan, it was assumed Japan would no longer need to import uranium. Monju reached criticality in April 1994 and began generating electricity for the first time the following year. However, it was forced to shut down in December 1995, following a sodium coolant leak and fire, and subsequent cover-up attempt. Did it resume operation after the 1995 accident? The reactor went online again in May 2010 for the first time in about 14 years. But just three months later, in August, it was again forced to shut down after a fuel-loading device fell into the reactor vessel. Monju has been idle since then. Other troubles include JAEA’s failure in 2012 to inspect some 10,000 reactor components, including more than 50 parts vital for the reactor’s safety. This prompted the NRA in 2013 to issue an effective ban on restarting the reactor. Due to a spate of accidents and JAEA’s apparent slipshod safety management, Monju has operated for just 250 days since it reached criticality in 1994. Still, more than ¥1 trillion in taxpayers’ money has been poured into the facility. Reports say about ¥20 billion in funding is required annually to maintain Monju even when it is offline. Earlier this month, Taro Kono, an anti-nuclear Cabinet minister in charge of administrative reforms, criticized the JAEA for wasting money on nuclear fuel transport ship Kaiei Maru, which has been used only four times since its introduction in 2006 but costs about ¥1.2 billion annually to maintain. Why has Monju been prone to accidents? Unlike ordinary nuclear reactors that use water as a coolant, the fast-breeder reactor uses sodium, which reacts violently with water. Experts say Monju’s past accidents were partly due to the difficulty in handling sodium. Will the science ministry be able to find a replacement for the JAEA? It would be extremely difficult, experts say. The key to operating the facility is whether a candidate has the skill and experience to handle sodium. Hideyuki Ban, co-director of the Tokyo-based Citizens’ Nuclear Information Center, said companies that have been involved in Monju’s construction or operations, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and the Japan Atomic Power Company, could be possible candidates. But those companies’ knowledge and ability to handle sodium or Monju itself do not exceed that of the JAEA, he said. “Although it has struggled, . . . (in the end the JAEA) has continued to run the facility up until now,” Ban said. “I believe there is no entity that has deeper knowledge (about Monju) than the JAEA.” What would happen if the government scrapped the Monju project? What the government fears most is that it could have a huge impact on the nuclear fuel cycle goals Japan has pursued since the 1950s. “There is no change in the government’s policy to pursue (the nuclear fuel cycle) by gaining (the acceptance of) municipalities and the international community,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Nov. 13. Some 17,000 tons of spent fuel rods are stored at nuclear power plants across Japan, waiting to be reprocessed to extract plutonium. If the Monju project is scrapped, they may end up as dangerous waste with nowhere to go. Experts say that because the government plans to restart reactors nationwide, the storage pools will become full of spent fuel rods. Thus it is widely believed that the government will continue to pursue the use of reprocessed fuel in ordinary light-water reactors even if the fast-breeder reactor project is discontinued. How much plutonium does Japan possess? As of December 2014, Japan had about 47.8 tons of plutonium, according to the Cabinet Office. This includes about 10.8 tons in Japan and 37 tons that have been reprocessed and stored in the U.K. and France, waiting to be returned to Japan to be used as fuel. NHK reported the amount is enough to make about 5,900 atomic bombs. Are there any countries other than Japan pushing to develop fast-breeder reactors? Russia, China and India are still eagerly pushing to develop fast-breeder reactors, but none has established the technologies to operate the reactors. Many industrialized countries, including the U.K. and Germany, gave up development of the reactors a while ago, given the technical and cost hurdles.",

    "source": "DPJ on the rocks amid calls for merger with Ishin no To <eos> Japan’s largest opposition party appears to be in danger of falling apart, as some of its core members prepared Thursday to officially demand that their leader dissolve the party and create a new force with Ishin no To (Japan Innovation Party). Democratic Party of Japan policy chief Goshi Hosono and former President Seiji Maehara held talks with former Ishin President Kenji Eda on Wednesday night and agreed to work for the dissolution of the two parties and the formation of a new opposition force powerful enough to challenge Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party in next summer’s Upper House election. Maehara is set to put the demand to DPJ President Katsuya Okada “sometime soon,” according to Kyodo News. Eda had met with Okada on Wednesday night and suggested the two parties dissolve and form a fresh force, but Okada rejected the idea, the news agency reported, quoting an anonymous source close to Eda. Since the DPJ lost power to the LDP in the December 2012 general election, the party has struggled to gain voter support and muster much influence in a Diet mostly dominated by the ruling LDP-Komeito coalition. The move, however, could trigger an internal feud between conservative DPJ members who support Hosono and Maehara, and those who are close to Okada and reluctant to dissolve the party. During a news conference Thursday, Okada said he had not confirmed the reported agreement, and attempted to reassure party supporters. “There is no need to worry. I am the leader (of the DPJ),” Okada said. Okada declined to make further comment, but said that to break the stagnant situation “(the party’s) essence must be changed.” “Changing the signs won’t work,” he said in an apparent reference that a new party could end up being the same people calling themselves by a new party name. Hosono and Maehara have been eager to form a new opposition force with Ishin for a long time and have criticized Okada after he seemed to be looking at ways to cooperate with the Japanese Communist Party in the next Upper House election. Meanwhile, the head of Ishin, Yorihisa Matsuno, who has repeatedly voiced hope of creating a new opposition force with the DPJ by the end of this year, welcomed the move and urged the DPJ leadership to accept the demand. “It would only take a nod from a member of (the DPJ’s) leadership such as Okada or (Secretary-General Yukio) Edano” to realize the realignment of the opposition forces, Matsuno said at a news conference. According to NHK polls, the DPJ’s support rate has faltered to around 7 to 10 percent in the past year, while that of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s LDP stands at about 35 to 40 percent.",

    "source": "Zzzz — a novel way to manipulate sleep <eos> The Milinda Panha is a Buddhist text written more than 2,000 years ago. It takes the form of a dialogue between Indo-Greek King Menander I and a Buddhist sage. At one point, the king is interested in the meaning of dreams. The sage talks about the possible influences of the waking life on dreams and then mentions that they occur in the period between falling asleep and deep sleep. This insight is fascinating, because scientists weren’t able to make much more progress than this until the 1950s. For something so universal, it’s odd that scientists really didn’t start to understand what goes on when we sleep until relatively recently. The breakthrough came when American physiologists Eugene Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman were making observations of sleeping infants and recording different phases of sleep. In particular, they noticed that the eyes would sometimes jerk and twitch under the eyelids. The pair named this “rapid eye movement” (REM) sleep and later found that it didn’t just occur in babies but in people of all ages. We’ve seen it since in all mammals and in birds, too. You probably know that REM sleep is closely associated with dreaming. Wake someone during REM sleep and they will almost always be able to tell you about the dream they were having. It turns out that dreams are quite taxing in terms of energy, as measured by oxygen use and glucose metabolism in the brain. The brain uses up at least as much energy — and sometimes more — when in REM sleep compared to when we are awake. Now, it seems, our understanding of sleep has taken another important step forward. Yu Hayashi of the International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine at the University of Tsukuba and colleagues have discovered the identity of the neurons that control REM sleep. “We found a brain region that controls REM sleep, and we hope to discover drugs that affect the activity of this area,” Hayashi says. “This should lead to an increase in REM sleep and, hence, improve sleep quality.” Hayashi’s colleague, Shigeyoshi Itohara, of the RIKEN Brain Science Institute says there will be ethical concerns to take into account. “However,” he says, “if our understanding reaches a certain level, we might be able to create a novel way to manipulate sleep in humans.” The pair studied sleeping mice to identify the neural circuit in the brain that regulates REM sleep. They also found that REM sleep controls the physiology of the other major sleep phase, the imaginatively named non-REM (NREM) sleep. Neuroscientists suspected that REM sleep was controlled from a part of the brainstem called the pons. Hayashi and Itohara observed that many cells in the pons originated from a distant brain area called the rhombic lip during early embryonic development. The team used a new technique to label cells from the rhombic lip in order to track their migration through the brain. They could then activate the cells artificially. They used a technique ominously called “DREADD,” which stands for “Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs.” They used mice that were genetically engineered to have special rhombic lip cells, which could then be controlled by giving the mice a drug. Hayashi’s team were able to suppress REM sleep, leading to an increase in the dreamless blank of NREM sleep. The scientists then investigated the role of REM sleep in controlling the other phases of sleep. If you record brainwaves at different stages of sleep, you find that NREM sleep has large, slow waves of activity moving across the brain, whereas REM sleep has lots of unsynchronized activity. Using their master control switch — the DREADD system — the team could shorten or lengthen REM sleep. What they discovered was that size of the slow waves that followed in the next bout of NREM sleep were correspondingly smaller or larger. It’s the first time that anyone knew that there was a hierarchy of sleep, and that NREM was controlled by REM sleep. “We found that REM sleep enhances slow waves during NREM sleep. Slow waves are important for memory consolidation,” Hayashi says. “Thus, we think one role for REM sleep is to control NREM sleep quality.” It’s important to understand how and why our sleep patterns evolved. Reptiles, amphibians and fish don’t have two phases of sleep in the same way that mammals and birds do. We know that new experiences we have during the day are stored in the brain that night during NREM sleep. Until the work of Hayashi and Itohara, we didn’t know that REM sleep had such an important role in this consolidation. “I hypothesize that REM sleep has crucial roles in nondeclarative memory and emotional memory,” Itohara says. Nondeclarative memory, also known as procedural memory, relates to unconscious memories and skills, such as knowing how to ride a bike. REM sleep occurs in bursts, getting longer throughout the night. By the end of the night, adults will have spent 90-120 minutes in REM sleep, totalling 20-25 percent of total sleep time. However, people with depression have more REM sleep, meaning they wake up still feeling tired. Sleep scientists try to understand the function of REM sleep by waking people up when their eyes start to flicker and their brain waves change. In this way researchers have built up a large set of dream diaries, and they found gender differences in dream subjects. There are obviously a huge variety of dreams but, generally, scientists have found that men tend to dream about fighting other men, whereas women commonly dream about talking with men and other women. A better understanding of how and why we sleep won’t just help us all feel more refreshed, it will help us understand how the brain works — and eventually help us answer those questions about dreams that Menander was so keen to understand.",

    "source": "Will Tokyo become Hashimoto's Wonderland? <eos> “It’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.” — Alice Liddell from Lewis Carroll’s “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” Six months have passed since Toru Hashimoto announced that when his term as Osaka mayor ends next month, he would retire from politics. Few believe him, but the utterance was in character, reflecting Hashimoto’s penchant for surprising allies and enemies. With the double election for mayor and governor now one week away, the question is whether Hashimoto will, like the Cheshire Cat from “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,” vanish from Osaka, only to reappear with a grin elsewhere (the prime minister’s office? The Diet?) in some other guise. Will he enter national politics if, as some media are speculating, next summer sees Upper and Lower House elections? Will he be appointed a nonelected member of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Cabinet after the new year, or at the very least chairman of some blue-ribbon government reform panel? Or, will he become an influential courtier, pontificating on the state of Japan on television by day, and slipping in and out of smoke-filled rooms and expensive nightclubs for private conversations with senior politicians at night? Answers vary, but where Hashimoto ends up next depends upon three things: the results of the Nov. 22 double election, his support in Tokyo and, perhaps most importantly, his own financial situation. A loss by Hashimoto’s hand-picked successor for mayor, Hirofumi Yoshimura, to Akira Yanagimoto, who is backed by the local chapters of the Liberal Democratic Party and Japan Communist Party, would likely create concerns about whether Hashimoto can still be a major political force, especially with the new national party, Osaka Ishin no Kai, he is creating. In politics, where power is often perception, Hashimoto could find his phone calls to senior LDP figures unreturned if a sense grows that his ability to expand the Ishin movement, with its LDP (or, at least, Abe) friendly views on constitutional revision, has waned. That leads to the second unknown, which is Hashimoto’s support base in Tokyo. Sure, he and Osaka Gov. Ichiro Matsui can pop by for tea and crumpets with Abe and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga whenever they are in town. But the LDP remains a series of factions and not all of them are as anxious to court Hashimoto as Abe, or at least Suga, sometimes appears to be. Mayoral candidate Yanagimoto is the nephew of Takuji Yanagimoto, an Upper House member from Osaka who belongs to the faction of Wakayama-based Toshihiro Nikai. He, in turn, has proposed a plan to revitalize Osaka that Hashimoto has criticized as vague, hinting it’s merely a political ploy by a Yanagimoto ally to win votes in the Osaka races. But if the younger Akira wins the Osaka mayor’s chair, the Nikai faction wins an ally and Abe and Suga have to think more carefully about how to handle Hashimoto. Finally, money. Hashimoto was a well-paid private attorney and television commentator before going into politics. Becoming a Diet member not only means spending lots of money, it also means stricter laws governing things like payment for television appearances. Does Hashimoto want the financial risk that comes with entering national politics, or will he take the safer route and remain in private practice, where he’s sure to add to his bank account? Perhaps Hashimoto himself does not know. He may attempt to reinvent himself after he leaves office, to convince the world he is not the same person he was yesterday. And that leads to the most important question of all: After seven years in the political limelight, who is he really? Ah, that’s the great puzzle. Curiouser and curiouser, indeed.",

    "source": "Zimbabwe's Mr. Ugly pageant turns ugly as contestants accuse judges of bias <eos> HARARE - Pageant judges have crowned a new winner of Zimbabwe’s 4th annual “Mister Ugly” contest, upsetting supporters of the crowd favorite and prompting rioting at the event. Judges on Saturday chose 42-year-old Mison Sere, citing his numerous missing front teeth and a wide range of grotesque facial expressions, over William Masvinu, who had held the title since 2012. Masvinu and his supporters mobbed the judges upon hearing their decision, claiming that Sere was “too handsome” to win and his ugliness is not natural since it is based on missing teeth. “I am naturally ugly. He is not. He is ugly only when he opens his mouth,” maintained Masvinu, gesturing at his rival. “Do we have to lose our teeth to win? This is cheating,” shouted another contestant, Patrick Mupereki. While no one was injured, there was a great deal of pushing and shoving as the results were announced and insults were hurled at the judges. Beauty pageants are popular in this southern African country and even though they are typically for women, scandal is not unusual. Earlier this year, Miss Zimbabwe winner Emily Kachote faced a backlash on social media, with Zimbabweans calling her ugly and undeserving of the crown. She was later forced to step down when just two weeks into her reign, images surfaced of her posing nude — which incidentally also brought down her predecessor. Sere dismissed the critics as just “sore losers” as he pocketed the $500 in winnings. “They should just accept that I am uglier than them,” he said. “I hope to get a TV contract. I already moved around schools performing and showcasing my ugliness so this is a chance to make it on TV.” The complaints of Masvinu and the other contestants may have a degree of validity. Organizers had previously announced that disabilities or enhancements would not be accepted in the competition, in which “natural ugliness” was the focus. Pageant organizer David Machowa originally said that he began the contest to remove the stigma of ugliness. “Looks are God given. We should all be proud of who we are,” he said. The pageant involved three rounds of modeling, with individual and group struts down a catwalk at a Harare nightclub. “Sere made tremendous effort to enhance his ugliness by pulling facial stunts,” said judge Abigail Mataranyika, a university student. “Masvinu thought he is so ugly that he didn’t need to try hard. That cost him the crown.” This year’s competition attracted a record 36 entries, compared to just five in 2012 when Masvinu began his winning streak. The competition was suspended in 2014 due to a lack of sponsorship, but this year the owners of a string of Harare nightclubs donated $1,000.",

    "source": "Osaka group preps Kansai solution to Futenma base row <eos> OSAKA - If a group of Osaka residents has its way, the U.S. Marine Corps base at Futenma in Okinawa may not end up in the northern part of the island, but in one of five spots in their prefecture. The effort comes more than 20 years after the rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen sparked calls to reduce the U.S. base presence. Over the past 15 years, three U.S. presidents and nine prime ministers, including Shinzo Abe (now taking his second swing), have failed to fulfill the bilateral agreement to replace U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Ginowan, with a new base in Henoko, in Nago. This is due to fierce local opposition that has only grown more intense since last November’s election of anti-base Okinawa Gov. Takeshi Onaga, and a refusal by Tokyo and Washington to consider alternatives. Onaga, Nago Mayor Susume Inamine and a majority of Okinawans oppose the Henoko plan. Onaga recently defied Abe by withdrawing permission, granted by his predecessor, for a related landfill project. A long series of court battles between Okinawa and Tokyo now appears inevitable. Meanwhile, tensions and clashes between anti-base protesters from Okinawa and elsewhere, and security forces from Tokyo and Okinawa are increasing. To finally solve the problem, a small group of traditionally anti-base activists in Osaka has been calling for Futenma’s replacement airstrip to be built in Osaka. They hope to lighten Okinawa’s base-hosting burden and prevent an escalation of violence. The group, consisting of about a dozen core members, is led by Aki Matsumoto, a 32-year-old woman who became involved with the Okinawa base issue during college. As years passed by without any resolution, she realized that Japanese in the rest of the country were not thinking about the base issue as their problem. Pro-base and pro-security alliance Japanese were perfectly happy to voice their support for replacing the Futenma base, as long as nobody suggested its replacement be located in their quiet neighborhood, while anti-base protesters were not offering solutions. Caught in the middle were the Okinawans. “The members of our group who are offering to bring Futenma to Osaka are people who have long years of experience opposing U.S. bases around Japan, starting with Okinawa. Within Japanese society, which approves of a discriminatory policy toward Okinawa, shouting ‘We don’t need bases anywhere’ will just lead to the bases in Okinawa remaining where they are,” Matsumoto said. At present, Matsumoto and her group are thinking about five places in Osaka Prefecture where Futenma’s successor could be built. They include Kansai airport, Yao airport (a smaller facility used by the Self-Defense Forces), Yumeshima, an artificial island in the city of Osaka, Takatsuki, in the northern part of the prefecture, and Izumiotsu, a city on Osaka bay between Kansai airport and downtown Osaka. At a recent seminar on how to persuade Osaka residents to host the base, Matsuno said that at this point, the discussion is just getting started. The group’s goal and site suggestions, which include places where its members reside, have not yet been presented to government officials from either country, and the feasibility of each site still needs to be explored, she said. “I know there are concerns about bringing an Okinawa base to Osaka. However, we have to bear in mind that we’ve been avoiding responsibility for what’s happening in Okinawa. Upon deciding to bring the base to Osaka, all Osakans can resolve various problems and concerns,” Matsumoto said. A survey by the Cabinet Office earlier this year said 83 percent of the public believes the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is useful for Japan’s peace and security, even as Okinawan media polls consistently show a clear majority of residents do not want the Futenma base to stay in their prefecture. A June survey by the Ryukyu Shimpo newspaper said that while 31 percent of residents want the base removed from Japan, about 22 percent were willing to see it moved to another prefecture. Midori Ikeda, a professor at Otsuma Women’s University in Tokyo who studies Okinawa discrimination issues, noted that mainland Japanese tend to make excuses for keeping the bases in Okinawa, which just encourages further discrimination. “People say the Okinawans have so many bases because they are too conciliatory, or that Okinawa is using them as a negotiating card to get more central government funding for local infrastructure projects,” Ikeda said. “But what we have now is a situation whereby peace activism and discrimination toward Okinawans exists side by side.” The idea of shifting Futenma’s operations to Kansai is not new. In 2009, and then again in 2012, during a time when the Democratic Party of Japan was in power, Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto suggested Kansai airport could host the base. In addition, Osaka Gov. Ichiro Matsui said in September 2012 that Osaka Prefecture could host Futenma’s replacement. “We’re ready to accept the base,” Matsui said at the time. However, Hashimoto and Matsui would later reverse their positions after the Liberal Democratic Party returned to power in December 2012. The hurdles — political, economic, and logistical — of trading the Henoko plan for Osaka are daunting. Tokyo and Washington remain firmly committed to the plan. Politically influential businesses involved in its construction would create problems if the plan were dropped. Local opposition in Osaka would have to be overcome and — most importantly — any new site would have to meet the logistic requirements of the U.S. Marines. In the past, Japanese officials in the ruling and opposition parties have also suggested Kyushu and Hokkaido as alternatives to Henoko. Kyushu in particular remains a possibility. There is a U.S. Navy base at Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture, and the Defense Ministry has just unveiled a plan that would deploy up to 70 Self-Defense Forces aircraft, including contentious V-22 Ospreys, at underused Saga airport. In fact, there is already a group similar to Matsumoto’s in Fukuoka, which has proposed relocating Futenma’s operations there. Yet whatever the results of such efforts, it’s clear that some in Osaka who have long opposed building a new base in Okinawa believe it’s time for new, out-of-the-box thinking.",

    "source": "‘Japan Sumo Cup’ is possibly the most Japanese thing ever <eos> Do you like sumo? Into horse racing? Longtime fan of “Street Fighter”? Well, then do we have a game to match your specific and varied interests. “ Japan Sumo Cup ” is a free web-based game that — prepare yourself — lets you play as real sumo wrestlers riding actual horses from the Japan Racing Association while competing against characters from “Street Fighter.” No, this isn’t a joke. The Japan Racing Association developed the game with the Japan Sumo Association and Capcom to help promote an upcoming race on Nov. 29, and also created the most Japanese thing in quite some time. In this rhythm game, players can choose from different sumo wrestlers and then compete against characters from Capcom’s popular fighting series, including Blanka, Guile and M. Bison. The best part is that there are many nods to “Street Fighter” in “Japan Sumo Cup,” such as Dhalsim riding an elephant instead of a horse. Each fighter’s stage comes with a remixed version of their background music from the original game, and they even perform their signature moves when the race gets close. Ryu shoots out his Hadouken blast and Chun-Li does her Spinning Bird Kick. In order to win, players have to tap the arrow buttons on their keyboards at the right moments to rack up combos and win the race. Since the beats match the music from “Street Fighter,” old-school players who have the original soundtrack burned into their brains will have a leg up on the competition. With this game, the JRA and Sumo Association, long the pastimes of elderly men, are clearly trying to reach out to the next generation. It kind of reminds us of when JRA put QR codes on betting tickets in 2002 or when the Sumo Association held “gokon” matchmaking events at one of its matches. You can place your bets now on whether or not this joint venture pays off. “Japan Sumo Cuo” can be played for free online. The site says that more characters will be unlocked later this week.",

    "source": "Who's responsible for the Fukushima disaster? <eos> The International Atomic Energy Agency released its comprehensive — but mostly ignored — final report on Fukushima on Aug. 30. It blamed the March 2011 triple meltdowns at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima No. 1 power plant on a blind belief in “the nuclear safety myth.” In other words, the myth that Japan’s “nuclear power plants were so safe that an accident of this magnitude was simply unthinkable.” “The regulation of nuclear safety in Japan at the time of the accident was performed by a number of organizations with different roles and responsibilities and complex interrelationships,” the report said. “It was not fully clear which organizations had the responsibility and authority to issue binding instructions on how to respond to safety issues without delay. The regulations, guidelines and procedures in place at the time of the accident were not fully in line with international practice in some key areas, most notably in relation to periodic safety reviews, re-evaluation of hazards, severe accident management and safety culture.” I’m sure we all remember the “unforeseeable” accident that happened in Fukushima in March 2011, an accident that will take an estimated 40 years and billions of dollars to clean up, some of it already subsidized with taxpayer money and higher electric bills. Having restarted a reactor at the Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima in August, one might suspect that the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Kyushu Electric Power Co. don’t appear to remember this accident very well. For a start, putting the reactor in Kagoshima back online didn’t exactly go according to plan. Despite months of inspection, seawater was detected in the reactor’s cooling system in late August. Alarm bells sounded. In spite of all the checks and balances that were introduced in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, power utilities are continuing to drop the ball as far as their reactors are concerned. How can we ensure such oversight is avoided? Katsunoba Onda, author of “Tepco: The Darkness of the Empire,” which predicted in 2007 the nuclear accident at Fukushima, and lawyer Hiroyuki Kawai, who established the National Network of Counsels in Cases against Nuclear Power Plants, have proposed a very simple way of ensuring this happens: hold nuclear plant operators criminally liable for negligence. The threat of incarceration might help them take their work more seriously and less likely to cut corners. The Prosecutorial Review Board appears to back such a proposal, approving the first criminal prosecutions of three former Tepco executives last July. The board consists of a panel of 11 private citizens, who operate under a rarely used set-up in the Japanese legal system that allows outsiders to review prosecutors’ decisions. The panel ordered that Tsunehisa Katsumata, chairman of Tepco at the time of the accident, and two former heads of the utility’s nuclear division, be charged with professional negligence resulting in death and injury. Prosecutors, however, have to date been slow to pursue criminal liability in the case. They did accept submissions from the public but then leaked their decision not to prosecute just as Japan won the right to host the 2020 Olympic Games. The story, however, doesn’t end there. This decision was again sent to the Prosecutorial Review Board, which again recommended that a criminal case be filed. For the second year in succession, the Prosecutorial Review Board overruled the prosecutors. Prosecutors have reportedly continued to reject the case because “it is not possible to prove negligence.” The IAEA report is expected to be submitted as evidence showing the exact opposite. “When you have a disaster of this scale, isn’t it crazy not to pursue responsibility?” Kawai, who led the citizen’s group that filed charges with the prosecutors, told Nikkan Gendai. “The common sense of the people overturned the judgment of prosecutors, prosecutors who favor large companies and the powerful. Tepco knew about the possibility of a large-scale tsunami and did nothing about it. The idea that if it’s not easily foreseeable, no one is responsible is mistaken. Abe says ‘Japan has the safest nuclear standards in the world.’ He’s the only one saying it. It’s not true. The Abe administration’s push for war and for nuclear energy are very dangerous — one mistake and this country will be destroyed.” If the Tepco executives are tried in court and found guilty, it wouldn’t be the first time nuclear power operators were convicted of criminal negligence resulting in death. In 1999, two employees died in an accident at the Tokaimura power plant run by JCO, a nuclear fuel cycle company. Six of the company’s executives were later charged and pleaded guilty to criminal charges of negligence resulting in the deaths. They were all given suspended sentences.",

They refused to respond when the usual roll was called and burst out singing martial songs, paying no regard to the admonitions of the authorities. The demonstration was brought under control when some 100 soldiers with loaded rifles were dispatched to the camp from Kurume Regiment. Some practical measures will, it is understood, be taken to deal with the prisoners as they deserve. Recently the prisoners at Kurume have been markedly remiss in discipline, some trying to escape from the camp. Last Monday, camp director Masaki told the prisoners to be more careful in their conduct. Shortly after the director’s order was given, a prisoner failed to obey an order and was consequently punished severely. This incident led to the rebellious conduct the same evening. In this connection, it may be worth mentioning that the prisoners had been hoping for the return of four of their comrades who had escaped some time ago only to be recaptured, and that it was to their great disappointment that those four prisoners had subsequently been committed to prison by a court-martial. 75 YEARS AGO Sunday, Oct. 13, 1940 Throne Assistance body meets for the first time The Association for Assisting the Throne held its inaugural meeting today, marking the first step toward the realization of Japan’s new national order. Present were Premier Prince Fumimaro Konoye, all Cabinet ministers except Commerce and Industry Minister Ichizo Kobayashi, who is in the Netherlands East Indies, along with assorted advisers, directors, councilors, and bureau and department heads of the association. After an opening address by Cabinet Secretary Kenji Tomita, the attendants paid their respects to the Emperor, prayed for victory, offered a silent tribute to the heroes who sacrificed their lives for the State in the China Affair and sang the national anthem. Premier Prince Konoye then read the historic declaration of the Association to the following effect: “Japan is now confronted with an epochal transitional period. The time has arrived when we should proceed with the establishment of a new order in Greater Asia and also a new world order, consolidating our league with our good neighbors internationally and establishing a new structure internally. “In view of the current international situation, the Government is bending all its efforts on the construction of a highly organized national defense structure in obedience to His Majesty’s command. “Such a structure will become possible when all old shells are cast off the fields of politics, economy, culture and others, and when all people start to cooperate with each other in one mind and every field of state mechanisms are enabled to function organically and smoothly. “The object of the Association is to enable the people to render their sincerest service to the Throne day and night through their respective occupations.” The association’s name is now commonly translated as Imperial Rule Assistance Association. 50 YEARS AGO Sunday, Oct. 10, 1965 Hope abandoned for missing fishermen The Maritime Safety Agency virtually gave up hope Saturday afternoon for the survival of the 208 Japanese fishermen missing in the Marianas in the central Pacific after their boats were caught in Typhoon Carmen on Thursday. U.S. Navy and Coast Guard rescue planes dispatched from Guam Island and 16 Japanese fishing boats were combing waters near Agrihan Island in the Marianas, where seven Japanese fishing boats with a total of 251 fishermen were caught in the typhoon. As of Saturday morning only one of the seven boats — the 160 ton No. 11 Benten Maru with a crew of 40 — was found aground near the island, with one crew member reported missing. Among the crewmen of the missing boats were 11 minors fresh out of junior high schools. The teenage boys were recruited by shipowners to help ease the short supply of fishermen. This is the second worst maritime disaster in modern Japanese fishing history. The worst accident was the one on May 9 and 10, 1954, when a total of 409 fishing boats were lost in waters off Hokkaido in a violent storm, killing 337 fishermen. 25 YEARS AGO Thursday, Oct. 4, 1990 Kaifu congratulates unified Germany A message of congratulations on Germany’s unification from Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was aired on German television Tuesday, government officials said. “I heartily congratulate you on the accomplishment of unification of East and West Germany, the earnest wish of the German people, and pay deep tribute to the indomitable patience and wisdom shown by the German people for realization of unification,” Kaifu said. “I am convinced that a unified Germany will play a more important role in Europe, which seeks a new order, and for peace and prosperity of the international community. “There has not been a time like today when both Japan and Germany are being urged to contribute to the peace and prosperity of the international community.” German reunification is not likely to affect Japan’s foreign policy for the time being, government sources said. However, they expressed hope that creation of a unified German as a key member of the European Community might work against the emergence of a protectionist trading bloc.",

    "source": "Shortcomings identified in new reporting system into hospital deaths <eos> On Thursday, the government launched a new reporting system for deaths resulting from medical care. The iryojiko chosa seido (medical accidents investigation system), created based on last year’s revisions to the Medical Care Law, is aimed at preventing recurrences of medical accidents and ensuring patient safety. Under the system, all of the nation’s 180,000 hospitals and clinics are mandated to investigate “unexpected” cases of patient deaths themselves, regardless of their legal liability, and report the results to the next of kin and a third-party organization. While some people have hailed the move as a positive step to prevent adverse events, others say it falls short of adequately addressing the needs of patients and families wanting answers. Following are questions and answers on the issue: Does the new system cover all medical accidents in Japan? No. The system targets only “unexpected deaths” in relation to medical care. It is up to the heads of the medical institutions to determine whether the deaths could not have been anticipated. Also, since the system focuses on deaths that apparently resulted from improper patient care, it only covers those who died. Once a hospital concludes an unexpected death has occurred, it will probe the case. Their investigative teams must include outside experts to ensure impartiality. They must explain the results of their investigations to relatives of the deceased, and submit a report on each case to the Japan Medical Safety Research Organization — the health ministry-designated independent body held responsible for handling all reports. The names of doctors and hospitals are withheld in the reports. The organization’s job includes analyzing the information and proposing steps to avoid repeated fatal mistakes. What do the in-house investigations entail? The investigative team will examine medical records, interview doctors and others who provided care, and if necessary, interview the next of kin. They will perform autopsies or Ai — postmortem imaging before an autopsy — if they think they can gain further insight into the deaths, and if they have the consent of relatives. If the next of kin are unhappy with the conclusions made by the hospitals, they can ask the JMSRO to reinvestigate the cases, for a fee of ¥20,000. Why was the new reporting system created? The system was established in response to longtime calls by the public and medical community to create an independent, third-party mechanism to investigate medical errors and learn from them. A spate of serious accidents in the late 1990s sparked a public outcry and enhanced calls for patient safety. In January 1999, a patient mix-up at Yokohama City University Hospital resulted in surgeons performing cardiac surgery on a pulmonary patient, and pulmonary surgery on a cardiac patient. In another case that took place in February the same year at Hiroo General Hospital in Tokyo, a nurse mistakenly injected an antiseptic into a patient, who immediately died. The mistake was caused by improper labeling of medications. While these cases led to criminal prosecutions of the doctors and nurses involved, many in the medical community have argued that courts are not the best parties to deal with all adverse medical events, as judges do not have the high-level technical expertise necessary to determine often-complicated causal factors or to advise on error prevention. Patients and their families have also found it hard, mentally and financially, to sue hospitals. Is Japan’s approach unique? Not particularly. Across the world, there are two types of reporting systems: one focusing on learning and facilitating reform of hospitals, and the other focusing on pursuing public accountability, according to the World Health Organization. The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry says Japan’s approach is the former, thus it won’t punish anyone, and will keep patients and hospitals anonymous. Are we seeing more medical errors? The number of reported cases in Japan is rising, but experts say it’s largely because hospitals are coming forward and making more of their cases public, whereas in the past, they tried to hide them. Because there has been no reporting system covering all medical institutions, the total number is unknown. According to the Japan Council for Quality Health Care, 3,194 adverse events, including those that resulted in the death or injury of patients, were reported by 993 institutions in 2014. That’s 2.5 times more than the number reported in 2005, when 555 institutions reported 1,265 cases. Reports to the state-affiliated body are mandatory for large hospitals, but voluntary for others. Is the system satisfactory for victims? Ikuko Yamaguchi, who has long been involved in the ministry-led process to create the new reporting system, said it is a big step toward making hospitals transparent and accountable, but still has shortcomings. Director of Osaka-based patient support group Consumer Organization for Medicine & Law (COML), which has offered more than 55,000 consultations to patients and their families over the last 25 years, she said the good news is patients’ families now have a way to find out the truth surrounding the deaths of loved ones without having to go to court. Until now, families had no option but to sue hospitals to have them explain cases in detail. To do so required hiring a lawyer at significant cost. Under the new system, it is the responsibility of hospitals and clinics to pay for the cost of postmortem investigations. But families can access such services only if the hospitals decide a case meets the “unexpected deaths” criteria, which Yamaguchi says will vary greatly from hospital to hospital. The patients cannot initiate the investigative proceedings by themselves. “The system is designed in such a way that the autonomy of hospitals will be protected,” Yamaguchi said. “That means it won’t function unless hospitals clean up their act by themselves.” Also, hospitals are only encouraged, not required, to share the written reports that they submit to the JMSRO with the next of kin, with no penalties stipulated for not sharing them. Many hospitals are believed to be hesitant to share detailed facts on such cases with the families for fear such information will be used against them in court. Yamaguchi said, however, that the number of civil cases will decline if hospitals pursue full disclosure.",

According to a posting on the record book’s Chinese microblog, organizers said 4 metric tons of cooked fried rice was distributed to five different outlets. However, it said a portion had been handled inappropriately, violating the organization’s rules requiring that the food be edible and not be wasted. Local media quoted the Yangzhou tourism bureau as saying some of the rice was considered inedible and sent to a farm to feed pigs. Yangzhou fried rice is famed in China and throughout the world for its creative use of ingredients, including carrots, peas and ham. Local media said the record attempt last Thursday involved 300 cooks frying up the dish in individual woks before ladling it into one giant bowl for presentation. Most of it was then distributed to schools that had taken part in the event.

From Oct. 8-24, music lovers can head over to Shibuya to, literally, plug into a selection of over 3,500 songs. The Google Play Billboard is meant to give visitors a much-needed chance to try out its new music service. After LINE launched its music-streaming service in July, followed only weeks later by Apple Music , as Google Play Music seemed to be stuck in buffering mode with no plans to enter the market. However, after finally launching in September, Google has been going to all lengths to make Google Play Music stand out from its competitors. Located on Supeinzaka near the Shibuya Parco department stores, the Google Play Billboard may appear, from a distance, to be any other advertisement. Within the billboard itself is 1,300 individual headphone jacks, however, continuously streaming music from noon-8 p.m. everyday. Each jack features a different song, and the song selection changes over time so that you’ll never know exactly what you’re plugging into. Just watching all the careful efforts that went into the construction of the billboard is like watching a symphony. The 3,500 songs that make up the Google Play Billboard playlist are hand-picked from submissions from the public that people voted for on the official Google Play Music website . The public were given six different categories to vote on — “a song you’d like to play when your significant other comes over”; “a song for when you feel that your heart is going to break”; “a song you’d personally want to leave for the next generation”; and so on. These categories, which play into people’s emotional connection with music, resulted in hundreds of songs featuring both a wide variety of both Japanese and Western music. Visitors to the Shibuya billboard can anticipate everything from Mary J. Blige to AKB48, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu to The Rolling Stones. Additionally, anyone who signs up for Google’s streaming service by Oct. 18 will be able to listen to the Google Play Billboard’s 3,500 songs unlimitedly for free, as well as pay a lifetime reduced rate of ¥780 per month . After only a week, the Google Play Billboard has made quite a splash on social media, thanks to the hashtags #GooglePlayMusic and #渋谷3500万曲ビルボード (Shibuya 35,000 song billboard). ぐえ！面白！壁に1万3000個イヤホンジャックがあって、それぞれ違う曲が流れてる…！！ #渋谷3500万曲ビルボード #googleplaymusic pic.twitter.com/B4DBPpsOFH — よっぴー/吉田尚記 (@yoshidahisanori) October 8, 2015 Regardless of whether Google’s PR campaign hits the right note or falls flat, the Google Play Billboard has certainly proven that music can bring us all together.",

    "source": "Nevada cryotherapy center where worker died is closed because it lacked insurance <eos> LOS ANGELES - Nevada officials on Tuesday ordered the closure of a cryotherapy center just outside Las Vegas where police say a worker was found dead last week in a chamber that exposes a person’s body to extremely cold air. The facility operated by Rejuvenice LLC was ordered closed because it could not provide proof it had a worker’s compensation insurance policy, said Teri Williams, spokeswoman for the state Department of Business and Industry. The move to close the facility just outside the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson comes a week after Chelsea Ake-Salvacion, 24, was found dead of an apparent accident at the center on Oct. 20. Ake-Salvacion’s death has raised questions about the regulation of whole-body cryotherapy, which was offered at the clinic. The treatment has in the past few years become increasingly popular in the United States, especially with professional athletes and celebrities. Supporters of whole-body cryotherapy say it helps with recovery from injury or intense exercise and can improve mood. A person walks into a chamber that exposes the body to hypercooled air with a temperature as low as minus 240 degrees Fahrenheit (-151 degrees Celsius), while the person’s head remains outside. Ake-Salvacion was discovered dead in a chamber at the facility by another employee who called police, authorities said. Her death, which occurred when she was alone, has been determined to be accidental and no foul play was involved, said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Officer Michael Rodriguez. The local coroner is still working to determine Ake-Salvacion’s exact cause and manner of death. The Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration determined she was using the facility for personal use, Williams said. A representative for Rejuvenice did not immediately return a call or email seeking comment. It appears the facility was operating without a county business license, because it had not completed building and fire inspections, said Clark County Commissioner Mary Beth Scow. The death is of great concern to the local community, said Scow, who said the oversight of cryotherapy seems to fall between different state agencies. “It appears that there’s not a category for that because it is such a new industry,” she said. Hailey Cap, office manager at Rejuvenice, told the New York Times nitrous gas used to chill the air in a cryotherapy chamber can be debilitating. “I don’t know why she would go in there alone,” Cap told the newspaper.",

    "source": "How male killers transform into caring parents <eos> When animals kill babies of their own species, it’s brutal and shocking. Infanticide goes against everything we think adults should be in terms of looking after younger members of the species. Surprisingly, however, it happens fairly frequently in the wild. What’s going on? Primatologist Yukimaru Sugiyama of Kyoto University was one of the first scientists to document infanticide in the wild. Studying gray langurs in India in the 1960s, he found that monkey troops generally consist of a male and several females. Sometimes, however, a troop’s male is driven out by a stronger “intruder” male. When this happens, the new male often kills the troop’s infants. Sugiyama suggested that the killings were often due to stress, perhaps brought on by overcrowding. Indeed, infanticide was long thought to be pathological. In other words, the only explanation for infanticide was that the animal behind the act was either stressed or sick. These days, however, we have a better understanding of infanticide in the wild — males have no genetic interest in babies that are fathered by someone else. Their evolutionary concern is to mate with females and produce their own offspring. It’s abhorrent to us but, as far as natural selection goes, it makes sense for animals to kill babies that aren’t their own. It’s a simple waste of resources to raise another male’s offspring. Many different animals commit infanticide, most famously lions. Prides consist of several females and a dominant male, but, inevitably, a younger and stronger male will challenge and defeat the resident male. If there are lion cubs around at that time, well, that’s bad luck for them. However, infanticide also occurs with gorillas — otherwise believed to be relatively peaceful apes — and certain monkey species, as well as mice. If that all seems grotesque to us, it’s perhaps more monstrous to find that males who kills babies can easily — and naturally — become caring parents themselves when they father their own children. It’s hard to believe that male killers can transform into a doting parent, and yet that’s just one of those wonderful things about science. Kumi Kuroda is a scientist who is fascinated by the parent-infant relationship. Based at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute, her past work has included a study showing why babies — both human and nonhuman — calm down when they are picked up and carried. “The ultimate goal of our research is to understand and assist the parent-infant relationship in humans,” Kuroda says. Kuroda was a medical psychiatrist before she became a neuroscientist, and many people she saw were psychologically damaged by the parent-infant relationship they experienced in childhood. “So I joined the neuroscientific research field to really understand the brain mechanism of infant attachment to parents, and parental caring motivations,” she says. “To treat and prevent child maltreatment, we need to know how the normal brain works to care for young.” Now she is examining how male mice make the switch from killer to kind parent. Kuroda describes the typical behavior of a male committing infanticide. “A male mouse first approaches the unrelated pup,” she says, “(It then) sniffs the pup and squints into its eyes.” The male continues to sniff and poke the pup with its snout more violently, all the while becoming increasingly excited. “Finally its tail starts rattling,” Kuroda says, “and the male bites the pup.” Kuroda and her colleagues have identified regions in the brain that control both nurture and aggression. They have found that brain activity actually changes after a male has mated with a female and lived with her once she is pregnant. To test how this behavioral switch occurs, Kuroda’s team examined brain activation patterns that are induced by parenting and infanticide. The team recorded what happened when adult male mice were exposed to mouse pups. The adult’s behavior, whether paternal or infanticidal, was recorded. The scientists measured what was happening in nine different regions of the brain. To their surprise, Kuroda and her colleagues found that two tiny areas of the brain are responsible for a male’s behavior. They even showed that blocking the activity of the region that controls parental behavior could induce fathers to attack newborn pups. Their work has just been published in the journal EMBO. “There are several subsequent steps that need to be taken,” Kuroda says. “We think that social experience with a female must lead to paternal behavior through enhanced brain activity, but we need to determine how this happens.” How can this help us understand human behavior? Human society is structured differently from lions or gorillas, and we don’t (usually) have a mating system that consists of a single man and a number of women. However, research along the same lines as Kuroda and her colleagues might eventually shed light on what’s going on in those rare cases when men do commit murder. Should researchers be paying closer attention to the areas of the brain that Kuroda and her colleagues examined? “Infanticide committed by male mice is not equal to human child maltreatment,” Kuroda says, “but it may have some mechanistic similarities, which we want to investigate.” Kuroda says her team would like to investigate the function of these brain regions in primates, and are currently doing so in marmosets. “This is particularly important because currently we do not know of any regions in the primate brain that are related specifically to parenting behaviors,” she says. This surprises me. After all, parenting is so central to human nature and our offspring are extraordinarily demanding in terms of the time and resources they require. Human offspring require far more nurturing and care than the offspring of many other species and yet we still don’t know much about how our brains are wired to provide this nurturing. It’s chilling to think that opposing aspects of behavior may activate such tiny changes in brain activity. However, it’s also exhilarating to think that we may finally understand them more deeply.",

    "source": "Kyoto forum's leaders warm up to renewables <eos> Each autumn, the world’s most influential scientists, engineers, business leaders and science policy experts gather in Kyoto for the Science and Technology in Society Forum. The STS Forum is the brainchild of Koji Omi, a former finance minister and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry bureaucrat and one of Japan’s most powerful behind-the-scenes politicians. A regular STS theme over the years has been energy. Omi, as befitting a conservative Liberal Democratic Party politician and former METI bureaucrat, has long been aggressively pro-nuclear power. When Naoto Kan addressed the STS in 2009 as deputy prime minister, just after the Democratic Party of Japan took power from the LDP, he spoke of the need to pursue solar power and biomass energy. A few foreign attendees applauded, but guests from Keidanren, the utilities and the Japanese government sat stone-faced. For years, STS energy discussions were scripted less to address the realities of worldwide energy trends and how they were impacting “science and technology in society” and more to reflect the world view of Omi and the pro-nuclear Japanese government. This approach warmed the hearts of Japan’s fossil fuel lobby and nuclear power village. But it meant STS didn’t exactly attract creative, innovative thinking on cutting-edge energy technology issues. At this year’s conference in early October, however, renewable energy developments could no longer be ignored. Finally, some of Japan’s most influential leaders had given a nod, however slight, to more renewable energy discussion at STS. The old men at STS and in Japan’s nuclear power village had long seen renewable energy proponents as “communists” “eco-terrorists” or “dreamers” who were their ideological enemies and, therefore, not to be trusted with something as important as the nation’s energy future. It took them a while to admit (to themselves) that renewable energy was here to stay, especially since Japan’s major corporations (STS sponsors, many of them) were taking renewable energy very seriously indeed. True, Omi did make perfunctory remarks about nuclear power continuing to remain necessary — “both fission and fusion power,” he said. But the change of weather at the Kyoto conference was not merely the arrival of autumn. It was the winds of a subtle change in attitude: Some of Japan’s most trenchant defenders of fossil fuels and nuclear power were at least willing to listen to more presentations on the technological challenges of nuclear power and devoted a number of sessions to it. That this happened in Kyoto is also no surprise. From Hokkaido to Okinawa, local governments are pushing forward with renewable energy goals that are far more ambitious than the national energy strategy calling for 22 percent to 24 percent of electricity to be supplied by renewables by 2030. Kyoto Prefecture has announced it aims to be nuclear power-free by 2040. With liberalization of Japan’s electricity sector taking place over the next few years, most international predications showing renewable energy becoming ever-cheaper and battery storage technologies becoming ever-more efficient, local governments around Japan are often better poised to take advantage of these changes than megacity dwellers, who are hooked on lifestyles that require huge amounts of electricity and live in places whose sheer size means decisions take longer and opponents are more numerous and better funded. The revolution won’t happen overnight. But it is happening, and is now so obvious that even STS members who once fought tooth and nail to keep renewable energy discussion on the margins are, however reluctantly, embracing it more as a legitimate topic of discussion. When STS members gather in Kyoto next year, it may well be nuclear power, rather than renewable energy, advocates who suddenly find themselves, if not entirely on the margins, then at least further outside the center of attention.",

    "source": "Japan's rich: acutely aware of their wealth and not flashy with it <eos> One of the biggest socioeconomic issues in the developed world right now is the widening income gap between the rich and the not-rich. In the U.S., the gap has become so big that the so-called 1 percent have adopted a siege mentality by isolating themselves from the rest of society, in either gated communities or urban condominium towers. In Japan the rich are different, or at least, they seem to be. It’s often said that in Japan you may live right next door to a millionaire and not know it because his house looks just like yours. The idea that wealthy people in Japan don’t show off their wealth is perhaps grounded in the Japanese stereotype of not wanting to stand out from the crowd. Still, with Japan’s stock market on a general roll for the last several years, the Japanese media has started talking about the “superrich” ( chō-fuyūsō ). But how do you define a rich person in Japan? According to Atsushi Miura, who last year published a book titled “The New Rich,” the financial industry considers a person to be wealthy if their yearly income is over ¥30 million and they have assets of at least ¥100 million. About 1.3 million Japanese people have assets in that range, or 1 percent of the population. Another way to define the rich is that they tend to live off the interest and other capital gains derived from their assets, without ever touching those assets. In his research, Miura found that Japan’s 1 percent does indeed tend to avoid ostentation. They don’t build mansions — we’re talking real mansions, not condos — and believe it unseemly to “throw one’s money around indiscriminately.” However, the Japanese rich will spend money on things they like and tend to favor the intangible. They’re more likely to patronize the arts and go to concerts than splurge on sports cars or expensive jewelry. They travel often and take cruises. Miura has also found that the new Japanese rich are looking inward more: They buy Japanese stuff and travel domestically. They prefer expensive nihonshu to foreign wine, and Japanese artworks to Western ones. This is not simply a matter of taste. It is also an expression of civic responsibility. The new rich understand their place in society, and know that Japan needs their money. In a sense they take the “trickle-down” component of the theory of “Abenomics” to heart. Nevertheless, rich people still try to avoid having their assets taxed, so if they can keep those assets overseas, they will, and it was only this year that the government finally mandated that people with foreign assets of over ¥50 million must report them. Another characteristic of the new rich is that they are conscious of being rich, whereas traditionally rich people in Japan didn’t ponder their wealth. They took if for granted. That’s mainly because the new rich usually obtained their wealth through their own efforts or through some special skill or idea. Even people who inherit wealth or are in line to inherit wealth tend to get jobs and work their whole lives. There’s no concept of the “idle rich” in Japan. In fact, what the children of rich people inherit and what keeps them rich is not so much money itself but the tools for making money: the best education money can buy and a fundamental understanding of how money works, neither of which the average person may be able to access so readily. This idea was explored more fully on a recent segment of the TV Tokyo financial program “Nikkei Plus 10,” in which an employee from Nomura Research named Junji Hatoriya talked about how the new rich maintain their wealth while the vast Japanese middle class continues to just get by. Hatoriya identified three important segments of upper-income earners who “will become the new rich in the future.” The first segment is composed of the children of rich parents. Miura’s own research in this area dovetails almost perfectly with Nomura’s: The children of the rich are not necessarily inheriting their wealth or expecting to inherit it. Instead, they are learning from their parents’ example and embarking on their own investment strategies. Only 8 percent of the general population has any “experience in investing,” while 24 percent of children of people with assets of over ¥100 million have such experience, and 52 percent have stock portfolios themselves. Another segment is “power couples,” which Nomura defines as married couples in which both partners work and bring home a combined income of at least ¥10 million a year. Forty-four percent of power couples have investment experience, while only 15 percent of all double-income households do. More significantly, power couples usually employ financial planners and other professionals who advise them on how to manage their money, because they usually don’t have time to do it themselves. They spend their money freely, but mainly on things that will give them more free time, such as housekeeping services and expensive private day care. The last segment is the one that really intrigues Nomura: “digital seniors.” These are retired people who are tech-savvy and spend a good deal of their time online. They understand how the world works and educate themselves about investments through the Internet. Which isn’t to say they buy and sell stocks online. They still do that the old-fashioned way — through brokers — but since they have deep knowledge about financial trends, they are able to talk seriously to these professionals and make sound decisions. Nomura estimates that there about 8.8 million digital seniors, whose average assets amount to about ¥26 million, while the average assets of all seniors is about ¥14 million. It literally pays to know how to use your computer.",

Some 60 French and Italian bakers worked nearly seven hours Sunday to bake the French bread characterized by its soft middle and crusty exterior, methodically moving a specially designed portable oven along the length of the doughy preparation. The bakers worked at a rate of 20 meters an hour, their progress complicated by working outdoors and the biggest challenge to avoid any breakage. “It’s very difficult to do a big baguette because we are outside, you know, the temperature, it’s cold and we are outside so for the dough it’s not easy,” said Dominique Anract, one of the bakers and owner of the La Pompadour bakery in Paris. Putting a plastic cover over the dough helped. The Italian maker of Nutella, Ferrero, backed the enterprise to beat the 111-meter record held by a French supermarket chain. Once certified as a record-breaker, the baguette was cut and smeared with Nutella to share with the hundreds of Expo goers who celebrated the record. It was at least the fourth world record declared during the six-month Expo, which closes Oct. 31, including the longest pizza at 1.5954 km.",

    "source": "The Fukushima nuclear cleanup, four years on <eos> Tokyo Electric Power Co. is scheduled to complete a seaside wall at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power station at the end of the month. Since January, slightly tainted water has overflowed from drainage systems at Fukushima No. 1 into the ocean nine times. The company, which outlined the progress on the barrier last week during a tour of the facility, expects the completed wall to reduce the flow of contaminated water into the ocean. Following are questions about the current state of the plant: What are the next milestones? Along with the seaside wall, Tepco is reinforcing the drainage system that collects surface water from various parts of the facility with a new covered channel. Work on the new configuration, which began in May, is expected to be completed by March. The company also expects to start freezing a soil barrier around the wrecked reactor buildings by the end of the year. How long will decommissioning take? Tepco expects it will take another 30 years to 40 years to decommission the Fukushima No. 1 facility. What is the timeline for removing the spent fuel? Tepco expects to begin removing spent fuel in the No. 3 reactor in 2017, two years later than it estimated in 2013. Fuel removal in reactors 1 and 2 is expected to begin in 2020. Tepco is currently removing rubble from the three reactors that melted down. Once rubble is removed and the flow of water into the reactors is stabilized, workers will be able to enter the facility with a greater degree of safety, according to company spokesman Tatsuhiro Yamagishi. Tepco removed the largest piece of debris from the spent fuel pool inside the No. 3 reactor in August, a milestone for the early stage of decommissioning. Almost all debris removal efforts at No. 3 are complete, according to Akira Ono, chief of the Fukushima No. 1 plant. How much will the decommissioning cost? The company estimates that water management and reactor stabilization will cost more than ¥1 trillion in the next 10 years. The company had spent roughly ¥430.6 billion on decommissioning the facility as of June 30, according to Yamagishi. How many people are working at the site? About 7,000 contract workers and Tepco employees are at the facility on any given weekday. About half the workers are from the Tohoku region.",

    "source": "UNESCO strikes political nerve with Nanking Massacre documents <eos> A fierce battle is raging over UNESCO’s stewardship of history. Last week, Japan — the biggest donor to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization — created an international stir by threatening to suspend or reduce its financial contributions after the body accepted what China claims are historical documents about the 1937 Nanking Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanking, for inscription into its Memory of the World register. What is the Memory of the World program? And why are China and Japan battling over the details of the wartime atrocity? What is the purpose of the Memory of the World program? UNESCO launched the program in 1992 to fully preserve, protect and make permanently accessible documentary heritage with due recognition, according to the U.N. body’s website. UNESCO provides assistance to preserve historical materials,such as hand-written documents, photos, paintings, movies and other forms of records left across the world. So far 348 items in various categories have been registered, including the world’s oldest existing copy of the Quran, the archives of the Dutch East India Company, the hand-written musical score of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9, and the original “Diary of Anne Frank.” From Japan, five items have been registered, including documents on the Keicho Period Mission to Europe in the 17th century, materials related to the internment and repatriation of Japanese held in Siberia after the end of World War II, and historical documents archived at Toji Temple in Kyoto dated from 763 to 1711. UNESCO helps make registered materials more accessible, for example, by creating digitized copies and catalogs that are accessible over the Internet. How are the nominated documents screened? The International Advisory Committee, which consists of 14 experts appointed by the director-general of UNESCO, screens the applications. Countries, municipalities, private groups or individuals are all allowed to file nomination applications. The IAC then makes recommendations for registration that are usually endorsed by the director-general. The 14 experts, who serve in a personal capacity, are “chosen for their authority in the field of the safeguarding of documentary heritage,” according to UNESCO’s website. The director-general convenes IAC sessions every two years. Japan criticized UNESCO’s screening process as opaque and biased. Why? Japanese officials argued that the historical materials being presented are not verified as authentic by third-party historians or other countries involved in political rows over the materials. Tokyo and Beijing have been at odds over historical evidence on the weekslong massacre, in particular the number of estimated victims slaughtered after the Japanese army occupied Nanking in December 1937. The city is now pronounced Nanjing. The Chinese government claims that about 300,000 Chinese were massacred and numerous women raped by Imperial Japanese soldiers. The Japanese government does not deny that its troops murdered noncombatants and looted the city, but instead claims that the number cannot be determined by historical evidence. Despite the rhetorical dueling, Japan was not even allowed to review the documents China submitted, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last week. “The (screening process) takes place amid concealment and secrecy,” Suga alleged at a morning news conference on Oct. 13. Is the process unfair? According to Koichiro Matsuura, former director-general of UNESCO, the Memory of the World program is not based on any international treaty. Thus UNESCO does not disclose all of the materials submitted for nomination, or the minutes of the advisory committee’s deliberations. Nor does it listen to the opinions of countries potentially related to the materials nominated, the former diplomat said in a recent interview with Kyodo News. By contrast, UNESCO’S World Heritage program, which documents such cultural and natural heritage as architectural and monumental works, is based on an international convention, and the registration process involves deliberation by member countries. In addition, the preliminary reviews of the heritage program’s advisory panel are disclosed, too, Matsuura pointed out. “The system (used by the Memory of the World program) is still immature,” he reportedly said. Historians note that Tokyo admits the Rape of Nanking occurred. So why is it so upset with China and UNESCO? Japanese politicians and bureaucrats believe that China, even 70 years after the end of the war, is still trying to use Japan’s wartime misdeeds for propaganda and diplomatic purposes. Toward that end, China has often exaggerated or even fabricated the particulars of Japan’s wartime atrocities to weaken its diplomatic position, they say. Some nationalist politicians and intellectuals meanwhile maintain the massacre never took place, making the contentious issue even more sensitive in Japanese political circles. This has apparently encouraged the Cabinet of nationalist Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to take a tougher stance against UNESCO. Mainstream Japanese historians believe the Imperial Japanese Army slaughtered numerous captured Chinese soldiers and noncombatants, based on historical materials written by the soldiers. These include records of battles written during or shortly after Japan occupied the city. Their estimates range from 40,000 to 200,000 victims. They also agree that no existing evidence can provide a tally of the actual number of deaths with pinpoint accuracy.",

    "source": "Turncoat mobster gives glimpse at '70s Lufthansa 'Goodfellas' heist, ringleader's warning to lie low <eos> NEW YORK - The robbery crew that pulled off one of the biggest heists in U.S. history — the $6 million Lufthansa theft immortalized in “Goodfellas” — was elated at first but became fearful of being robbed itself, a turncoat mobster testified Tuesday at the trial of his former Mafia boss. The defendant, Vincent Asaro, was “very happy, really euphoric” when he learned about the mountain of $100 bills scored in the armed holdup, Gaspare Valenti told a jury in Brooklyn federal court. “We thought there was going to be $2 million in cash and there was $6 million.” But Valenti testified that the joy quickly evaporated when Asaro warned him, “We’ve got to be real careful now. They’ll look to rob us. They’ll look to kill us. It could be anyone who hears of the score.” The testimony marked the first time Valenti has given his blow-by-blow account of the heist. Prosecutors say he voluntarily came forward in 2008, implicated Asaro and agreed to testify against him in violation of the Mafia’s once-sacred vow of silence. After taking the witness stand Tuesday, Valenti, 68, was asked to point out Asaro in the courtroom and describe an article of clothing he was wearing — a blue V-neck sweater. He then described how he met the 80-year-old defendant in the 1960s and started working for him as a devoted Bonanno organized crime family associate. “I was very close with him. … We had, like, a bond,” he said. Valenti testified that his involvement in the heist orchestrated by James “Jimmy the Gent” Burke — played by Robert De Niro in the movie — began when Asaro told him, “Jimmy Burke has a big score at the airport coming up, and you’re invited to go.” The plan called for Valenti and another robber to take a stolen black van to the airport terminal and use bolt cutters to break into a side entrance, he said. Once inside the terminal, they teamed up with other armed and masked bandits who were holding several workers hostage in a lunch room, he said. The crew forced one of the workers to open a safe, where they discovered dozens of boxes containing packets holding $125,000 each, bags of gold chains and containers with precious gems that they threw into the van, he said. They then fled and rendezvoused with Asaro and Burke, who were in a car about a mile away, he said. Asked if the crew had an escape plan, Valenti responded, “No. It’s amazing — a robbery that big and nothing was discussed about where to go afterward.” Asaro and Burke decided the haul should be put in the basement of Valenti’s house in Brooklyn before it was moved to various stash houses, the witness said. Burke “gave very little money out at the beginning,” he said, and when he did, it was with a caveat: Don’t spend it in a lavish way that would draw the attention of law enforcement. Still, he said, Asaro used it to buy a second home, a boat and a Bill Blass designer addition of a Lincoln Continental. Prosecutors have said Asaro also gambled away a big chunk of his $750,000 cut at the racetrack. The defense has accused Valenti and other admitted mobsters expected to testify at the trial of framing Asaro to win leniency in their own cases. If convicted of racketeering conspiracy and other charges, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.",

    "source": "Technology key to clinching overseas projects, new infrastructure minister says <eos> Japan should keep promoting its high technological standards when pushing for infrastructure projects overseas, despite a recent loss to China on bidding for Indonesia’s first high-speed railway, the new land, infrastructure, transport and tourism minister said Friday. Keiichi Ishii, 57, a Lower House member of junior ruling coalition partner Komeito, said Japan should stick to its technological edge when exporting infrastructure, though it will need to fully examine how China won the Indonesian rail project. Jakarta dropped both country’s proposals last month, citing cost reasons, but subsequently awarded the contract to China, which, unlike Japan, did not require government guarantees. The loss to China is seen as a serious blow. “The biggest strength of our country (in infrastructure building) is safety and technologies,” Ishii said in an interview with media organizations following his appointment Wednesday. “That’s our unwavering principle. On top of that, we will need to understand where the needs of countries are.” Infrastructure exports are a key part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s drive to boost economic growth. Japan’s failure to win the Indonesian contract has thrown cold water on that plan. Ishii, chosen by Komeito to assume the party’s only post in the 19-minister Cabinet, will also oversee tourism policy. The number of visitors arriving in Japan has surged in recent years, and is expected to top 19 million this year, well in line with the goal of 20 million per year by 2020. Ishii remained cautious on the idea floated by some members of the ruling coalition that the nation revise the goal upward to 30 million per year. “We first need to be prepared to accept these 20 million people into our country smoothly,” he said. He added that Japan needs to tackle such issues as boosting airport capacity and improving Wi-Fi access before considering higher goals.",

    "source": "'Obsolete' gangsters proving problematic <eos> Organized crime syndicates are not fading away, they’re just becoming obsolete. Lawyer Hideaki Kubori and journalist Atsushi Mizoguchi, the country’s leading expert on the powerful Yamaguchi-gumi gang, held a news conference at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan in Tokyo on Oct. 20. While the recent breakup of the Yamaguchi-gumi led discussions, Kubori and Mizoguchi provided a succinct outline of the yakuza syndicates’ decline. “At first, they were parasites swarming to collect money whenever there was a bankruptcy. They were especially active before the ’80s,” said Kubori, who has 45 years’ experience in dealing with yakuza-related issues. Kubori noted the syndicates’ ties to gangsters known collectively as sōkaiya (specialized racketeers that extort money from companies by threatening to publicly humiliate management boards at annual shareholders meetings). In 1982, Kubori said, the government enacted legislation that banned payoffs to sōkaiya. In 1992, the country’s first anti-organized crime laws were enacted but had little effect. In 1997, however, the Tokyo Prosecutor’s Office arrested executives of a major securities firms for paying off gangsters and their associates, a move that Kubori said made large corporations sit up and take notice. Beginning in 2009, the police began to crack down on the gangs, and prefectural bodies began drafting anti-organized crime ordinances. By Oct. 1, 2011, such legislation had been enacted by local governments nationwide, making it illegal to work with gang syndicates. Ultimately, Kubota said, the consequences were devastating for organized crime syndicates. Any time someone takes out a loan, rents an apartment or even opens a bank account, applicants must acknowledge they do not have any ties to organized crime. If subsequent ties are identified, the police can — and often do — arrest applicants on suspicion of fraud. Life as a gangster in Japan has become something of an inconvenience. Mizoguchi noted that organized crime syndicates no longer engage in gang wars because, legally speaking, the leaders of the gang are held liable for any damages incurred. What’s more, syndicates are failing to recruit the country’s youth. “Youngsters aren’t joining yakuza syndicates,” Mizoguchi said. “They’d rather remain outside the gangs in a gray zone where they can put profit first. I can’t see this new generation of criminals getting involved in a gang war, and they certainly wouldn’t want to use firearms. At the worst, they might use a metal bat or beer bottle to bash their opponents into submission.” Both Kubori and Mizoguchi agreed that local authorities now need to target organized crime leaders for tax evasion. For example, police in Fukuoka arrested Satoru Nomura, head of the Kudo-kai, on June 16 on suspicion of not paying income tax on his earnings. “The (Yamaguchi-gumi) split will ultimately weaken the power of organized crime syndicates,” Kubori said. “As the country’s economy expanded so did the yakuza. Now, however, the domestic economic situation has changed.” Gangsters themselves aren’t seeing many advantages to working in a syndicate. “We can’t even wear our badges in public,” a low-ranking member in the Inagawa-kai, the third largest crime syndicate, told me earlier this year. “We can’t show people business cards with the organization’s logo on it. It’s like paying for a McDonald’s franchise without being able to use the golden arches — what’s the point? The brand no longer encourages people to pay up or earns respect. It’s a liability, not an asset.” A number of former gangsters agree. “Organized crime syndicates used to be thought of as a necessary evil,” Satoru Takegaki, a former Yamaguchi-gumi leader, told me in September. “Now they’re just evil. They are no longer even necessary.” Takegaki now runs Gojin-kai, a nonprofit organization that specializes in rehabilitating former gangsters. He said anti-gang legislation had made life for many low-level yakuza members economically unfeasible. Many are quitting but have few alternative opportunities, Takegaki said. Many of them are poorly educated and lack discipline. Takegaki helps many find work in the salvaging industry, dismantling obsolete electrical equipment. Still, he said, the country’s lawmakers need to provide better assistance to former gangsters who end up on welfare. “Dismantling a refrigerator is easy once you know how to do it but you have to careful, as dangerous materials are often involved,” he said. “The government is dismantling organized crime syndicates with no plan on what to do with the mess that is left behind. That can’t be good.”",

At this important ceremonial, Emperor Yoshihito formally acquired the Three Sacred Treasures — the Divine Sword, Jewel and Mirror — and reported before his ancestral spirit, the “Kashiko-dokoro,” the fact of his succession to the great and time-honored heritage. His Majesty then fervently prayed for the prosperity of his reign. In the spacious compound before the Imperial Sanctuary, sheds were built for the accommodation of persons entitled to be present at this ritual service. Here assembled this morning most prominent men of the Empire as well as the diplomatic representatives of foreign powers. Glittering gold lace on the civilians’ full dresses and the brilliant decorations worn by military and naval officers served to embellish the spectacle of a most distinguished gathering. At the climax of the ceremony, chamberlains placed the Divine Sword and the Divine Jewel by the side of the Emperor on a table. His Majesty, rising from his seat, proceeded in front of the door of the Sanctuary, and after performing obeisance to the spirit of his Ancestress, symbolized by the Divine Mirror enshrined in the Sanctuary, recited an Imperial Report announcing his formal acquisition of the Divine Treasures and praying at the same time. Obeisance was then performed by royalties and the Emperor left the Sanctuary with his retinue. 75 YEARS AGO Sunday, Nov. 3, 1940 Crowds throng Tokyo dance halls before ban All the remaining dance halls in Tokyo were crowded on Thursday night with dance-lovers, out to have their last night of fun, elbowing and jostling in the throng to the plaintive melody of Auld Lang Syne which signaled the curtains to be drawn on the 13-year-old history of Tokyo’s dance halls. With the halls overflowing with three to five times more than the unusual number, the cheerful faces of taxi-dancers, about to start afresh in their new careers within a few hours, were seen over the shoulders of their partners on the narrow floor, made more narrower by those waiting their turn. The trumpets blared more energetically and the orchestras were tuning it up more gaily as if to make the sayonara night appropriate to their gay but short history. “About one-half of the dancers are going back to their homes,” said a manager. “The other half have obtained jobs as typists, office-workers and employees in a chemical factory. At least, we are glad that all of the girls have got jobs before we closed.” Dancing had been banned by a law enforced from Nov. 1. 50 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Nov. 2, 1965 JNR’s Hikari is now world’s fastest train The superexpress Hikari of the New Tokaido Line Monday began the world’s fastest train service at an average speed of 162.3 kph, cutting travel time between Tokyo and Osaka by 50 minutes to 3 hours 10 minutes. The previous world record holder in terms of average operational speed was the French train Mistral, which travels a little over 130 kph. It took a long time for the Japanese National Railways to make the Tokyo-Osaka train the fastest in the world. Ever since Japan’s first express train covered the distance — in 17 hours and 40 minutes — in 1904, the JNR devoted its top brains in a bid to reduce travel time on the line, which has always been regarded as the “face” of the JNR because of its commercial importance. By 1934, the company had managed to shorten the trip to eight hours, but the quest for speed had to make way for military transportation requirements during the war. With the electrification of the whole Tokyo-Osaka section in 1955, the travel time was cut to 7½ hours. Then, with the completion of the New Tokaido Line in October last year, the Hikari and Kodama “bullet trains” started running the distance in five and four hours respectively. Both the Hikari and the Kodama have a maximum speed of 200 kph. 25 YEARS AGO Sunday, Nov. 4, 1990 Nearly 600 dolphins killed in Nagasaki Fishermen drove hundreds of dolphins onto a beach and slaughtered them for their meat Friday on the East China Sea island of Fukuejima, police said Saturday. A police spokesman said fishermen came across a school of up to 3,000 dolphins off Miiraku, a coastal town on the island in Nagasaki Prefecture, at around 5 p.m. Friday. A local fisheries union sent boats to the area early Saturday and the fishermen chased hundreds of the animals onto Shiragahama Beach. Eyewitnesses said at least 580 dolphins were forced ashore and beaten to death with clubs. The fishermen then used cranes to pile the carcasses atop a breakwater, they said. The police spokesman said residents of the Goto Islands, which include Fukuejima, traditionally eat dolphin meat. Residents of Miiraku said dolphin meat is an important source of protein for them because beef and pork are too expensive. One elderly woman said, “Although conservationists are increasingly critical of us, we have no choice but to eat them because we have so many dolphins.”",

The move means Sony can either sell its half of the music-publishing business or buy the other half, said the people, who asked not to be named because the agreement is private. Documents leaked by hackers who broke into Sony Entertainment’s computers last year revealed that executives at the company had discussed such a sale. A sale would bring Sony cash and reap a payday for a business it merged with Jackson’s in 1995 to establish Sony/ATV. Jackson, who had earlier purchased rights to The Beatles song library, died in 2009. In 2012, Sony, the executors of Jackson’s estate and other investors purchased the larger EMI song catalog, to form the world’s biggest music-publishing business. Music publishers collect songwriting royalties from album sales, use on TV and other performances. Sony/ATV also has rights to songs from several Motown artists, and administers the catalog for EMI. Sony/ATV has a value of around $2 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported on Wednesday that Sony had triggered the clause. It wasn’t clear whether Sony would include its share of EMI in a sale, the newspaper said. Sony Entertainment Chief Executive Officer Michael Lynton told Bloomberg News in January that the company had no plans to sell the music publishing business. Sony/ATV Chairman and CEO Martin Bandier said the same in a memo to staff.",

It is the first time that prosecutors have charged a person over leaking bar exam questions. Koichi Aoyagi, 67, had earlier admitted to the allegation and was indicted without detention on a charge of violating the confidentiality provision of the national civil service law. The prosecutors, however, decided not to indict the woman, in her 20s, whom Aoyagi had been tutoring, as they could not find any evidence that she had urged the former professor to leak the questions, according to prosecutorial sources. Aoyagi has said that he had leaked questions without being asked to do so because he was “fond of” the woman. According to the indictment and other sources, Aoyagi was in charge of creating questions for the bar exam held in May and allegedly gave the woman an essay question on the Constitution that later appeared in the exam. In the exam, the woman’s answer was better than those of other examinees and was also similar to a sample answer Aoyagi had made and circulated to other members tasked with formulating questions or grading answers in the bar exam. The members are appointed by the justice minister based on the recommendations of the ministry’s National Bar Examination Commission and have a legal obligation to keep secrets as a part-time national public servant. The commission filed a criminal complaint against Aoyagi on Sept. 8 for allegedly breaching confidentiality. Meiji University dismissed Aoyagi, effective Sept. 12. The prosecutors also indicted Aoyagi on a charge of leaking multiple-choice questions on the Constitution portion of the bar exam, in which the woman had perfect scores.",

    "source": "Venom experts say global snake bite death tolls are grossly underestimated <eos> LONDON - Venom specialists said Wednesday that disease and disability caused by snake bites is far higher than official global health estimates suggest, and that anti-venom stocks are running dangerously low. In a joint statement after a five-day conference in Britain, the international experts said snake bites kill more people than all other so-called neglected tropical diseases combined, yet get little attention or funding from the World Health Organization (WHO) or from governments. Citing new evidence from a study in India and Bangladesh, the experts said around 46,000 people died annually of snake bites in India, plus another 6,000 in Bangladesh. The WHO estimates the annual death toll in India from snake bites is 10,000. “Snake bite … is almost completely ignored and grossly underestimated,” said Alan Harvey, head of the International Society of Toxinology, who led the meeting. “WHO and governments need to … rank snake bite where it belongs — as a very real public health and medical concern which needs funding, training and focus.” Bites from snakes such as cobras, mambas and vipers mainly affect people living in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia that have scant health facilities nearby. Anti-venom treatment can cost between $250 and $500, the experts said, meaning many victims either seek no treatment at all or go to local witch doctors or herbalists. Despite high death rates, the WHO in 2013 downgraded snake bite to a “neglected condition” with no formal programme on how to address it as a health threat, the experts said. They also warned that anti-venom stocks are running “dangerously low” in many risk areas and that there is a “real crisis in the quantity and quality of anti-venoms in rural areas, where they are needed most.” Even where anti-venom stocks are of high quality, there is often a shortage of medical staff trained in how to administer them safely and effectively.",

The area is a fine place to stretch out on the grass and enjoy a picnic or simply breathe in the autumn air. Formerly the site of Edo Castle, built by the Tokugawa shogunate, the Imperial Palace is where the royal family has resided, worked and conducted rituals ever since Emperor Meiji moved from the Kyoto Imperial Palace in 1868. Some parts are closed to the public, but large areas of the 115-hectare grounds, roughly a third the size of New York’s Central Park, are open and are popular with tourists. Notable sights include a forest of 2,000 Japanese black pine trees and the well-tailored lawn of Kokyo Gaien National Garden. Strollers will also come across what is commonly known as Nijubashi Bridge — a popular spot for photos. A path around the perimeter of the Imperial Palace grounds attracts more than 4,000 runners daily, while inside the season’s flora is out in force — red spider lilies at this time of year — with ducks and swans swimming about. Open every day except for Mondays and Fridays, the East Garden is recommended for tourists who want a taste of Japanese culture and history. Visitors topped 1 million last year. This is were they can enjoy a Japanese-style garden and inspect the remains of Edo Castle. To cater to the growing number of foreign tourists, the park’s operator started offering free tours in English this year in addition to Japanese. Meanwhile, evening strollers can look forward to a new attraction: Plans are underway to light up buildings and bridges in Kokyo Gaien National Garden at night.

    "source": "Water, water everywhere in Japan, but fewer people to pay for it <eos> One of the most common received truths about Japan is that it lacks natural resources, which is why it relies so much on imports. Lack of resources was one of the reasons Japan invaded Asia in the last century. But there is one resource that is plentiful, and which is becoming scarce in other regions: water. In fact, there has been talk that Japan could export fresh water as a form of “security.” Japan currently buys a lot of coal from Australia, which is delivered by ship. Those vessels return to Australia empty, and usually have to fill up with sea water for ballast, a risky solution since the water could contain living things that might upset marine ecology systems back in Australia. But the ships could also fill up with fresh water — not necessarily drinking water, but water that could be used in the mining of the coal being sent to Japan. Coal mining requires a lot of water, and Australia doesn’t always have enough. It’s estimated that 900 million people in the world do not have ready access to safe drinking water, so Japan should count itself lucky. However, in recent years water supply agencies nationwide have been raising fees or proposing to raise fees on tap water. The reason has to do with Japan’s population decline. The infrastructure that processes water and delivers it to homes is superannuated in many places in Japan, but since revenues are dropping due to loss of users, local water supply agents don’t have enough money to repair and maintain these facilities. An article in the Asahi Shimbun on Sept. 7 looked at the town of Bibai in Hokkaido, which has announced that it is raising water-use fees by 30 percent this month, the first time it has done so in 33 years. If a household uses 10 cu. meters of water a month, it now pays ¥2,547. That fee will increase by ¥567. Before the war, the town was very prosperous because of a coal mine, and population peaked in 1956 at 92,000. Now it is down to 24,000, and the pipe network that moves water through the town is desperately in need of repair. Residential users may not feel as much pain, but business users are quite worried about the increase. One restaurant owner in Bibai told the paper that he now spends almost ¥600,000 a year for water, and with the fee increase he expects his bill to go up by more than ¥100,000. Bibai’s situation is typical of many towns and smaller cities throughout Japan. Because water supply agents cover specific areas, their revenue is limited by the number of users in that area. If there are many users, then costs for repair and maintenance can be spread more diffusely, but if the number of users is small, each one will have to bear more of the cost. A recent feature in the weekly magazine Shukan Josei reports that reservoir repair and maintenance costs for Tokyo’s water supply are the highest in Japan, but fees are among the lowest because of the number of users — about 10,000 per kilometer of pipe. Residents of Sendai and Sapporo, on the other hand, pay significantly higher fees for water because of the much smaller population density — in some neighborhoods as low as 100 users per kilometer of pipe. Bibai is now trying to consolidate its water supply agents with those in nearby towns, so that a larger pool of users can be tapped for revenues, thus reducing the per-user cost of repairs and maintenance. Another reason for the difference in fees is geology. The most expensive water, according to the Japan arm of accounting firm Ernst & Young Global Ltd., is in the town of Fukaura in Aomori Prefecture, where the average household is expected to pay more than ¥17,000 a month by 2040. Population decline is one reason, but the town is also very hilly, so the waterworks system needs lots of pumps to deliver water to a relatively small number of households. Of course, water abundance is also a factor. Kagawa, on the island of Shikoku, is one of the few prefectures that regularly suffers water shortages. Farmers on Shikoku traditionally grew wheat rather than rice, since rice requires so much water. The prefecture is now working on unifying the water supply agents of at least six cities so that they can reduce personnel and facilities expenses and thus not have to raise fees as much. The central government is also getting involved by identifying some 8,000 “simple water supply” ( kan’i suidō ) agents. Simple water supply agents are those who serve a user base that is not larger than 5,000 households. By identifying such agents, the government hopes to move them toward consolidating with neighboring agents, since the central government is required to subsidize waterworks in order to guarantee delivery of water. This happened in Shimane Prefecture, where smaller municipalities needed ¥2.1 billion a year for waterworks maintenance. Fees, however, only covered 30 percent of the maintenance expenses, so the government had to come up with the rest. Now, seven of these municipalities will merge their water networks with that of the capital, Matsue, with the help of the central government. Nevertheless, some municipalities are shrinking so fast that soon they will not be able to afford waterworks at all. Some agents may not be able to stay in business, regardless of how much they raise fees. That means the few households in their jurisdictions will have to actually transport water themselves, by vehicle. Another solution to the fee problem is conservation. Though Japan has abundant fresh water, the Japan Water Works Association is encouraging users to save water as much as possible. This will not only reduce their water bills, but ease the stress on the system, since there is less need for purifying chemicals and other treatments. The average person in Japan uses 250 liters a day. One of the reasons people here use such a large amount is that they tend to take daily baths, sometimes more than once. Switching to showers and changing toilet valves would help save water. To understand how lucky Japan is, all you have to do is look at a place like California, which, due to geology and climate-related developments, may never again have enough water for all its residents, no matter how wealthy they are. If higher fees are necessary to keep Japan’s water supply clean and plentiful, then that’s just the way it is.",

Authorities want to know more about where and when Robert Rembert worked as a regional driver, calling him a “serial killer” who already served time in prison for a fatal shooting in the late 1990s. “The feeling is given his violent history it only makes sense to dig down into what was going on in the interim,” said Joe Frolik, a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor’s office Rembert is expected to be arraigned Friday after being indicted this week on multiple counts of aggravated murder in the slayings of one person in 1997 and three people this year. He was arrested last month after coming out of a shower at a truck stop outside Cleveland and was being held on a $1 million bond, prosecutors said. “Robert Rembert is a serial killer,” Cuyahoga County prosecutor Tim McGinty said. “So far, we know he’s purposefully executed five people.” Rembert, 45, couldn’t be contacted for comment, and court records did not show whether he has an attorney representing him. Investigators know that Rembert traveled all over Ohio and into Pennsylvania and want to find out if his work took him into other states in the Great Lakes area, Frolik said. Prosecutors have said that DNA evidence matched Rembert to the rape and strangulation deaths of Rena Mae Payne in May 1997 and Kimberly Hall this June. Rembert was a Regional Transit Authority bus driver in 1997 and knew the entry code for the restroom where Payne’s body was discovered at an RTA bus turnaround, prosecutors said. Rembert also is charged in the fatal shooting of Morgan Nietzel and his cousin, Jerry Rembert, at a Cleveland home on Sept. 20, the day before he was arrested. Prosecutors say Robert Rembert lived in the home and shot both Nietzel and his cousin in the head. Rembert had argued with the pair before the killings, Frolik said. Nietzel’s car was found in the parking lot of the truck stop in Medina County where Rembert was arrested. The fifth slaying was the fatal shooting of Dadren Lewis in December 1997. Rembert pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced in 1998 to six years in prison.",

Growers gathered with their gargantuan offerings to try to break the world record of 2,323 pounds (1,054 kg), which was set by a Swiss grower during a competition in Germany last year. It didn’t happen. But the winning entry at the Safeway World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-off in Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco, was no small feat.

    "source": "Japan may empower courts to handle more cross-border divorce suits <eos> After 18 months of deliberations, the Legislative Council of the Justice Ministry has drawn up an outline for legal revisions aimed at resolving a problem many failed marriages face: whether the Japan-based spouse can file for divorce here rather than overseas. The council on Friday submitted a proposal to Justice Minister Mitsuhide Iwaki that lists several scenarios in which Japanese family courts should be authorized to handle divorce involving couples of whom only one partner is still living in Japan. If enacted, it would will mark the first time the government has clarified international jurisdiction rules for divorce. Following are questions and answers on the issue: What is the current situation? Japan has no law that spells out the circumstances under which family courts can handle cross-border divorce disputes between a spouse who sues, the plaintiff, and his or her ex-partner, the defendant. In the absence of a legal framework, family courts have traditionally decided on a case-by-case basis whether they have jurisdiction in divorce cases, relying only on past Supreme Court rulings. The rulings acknowledged jurisdiction of the Japanese courts when the defendant was resident in Japan, because the inconvenience of being forced into a legal battle, it was deemed, merited greater consideration than the inconvenience faced by a plaintiff. If the defendant was overseas, that was where the case should be heard. The-case-by-case approach means there has been no consistency in court judgments, while plaintiffs and their lawyers have had to convince the courts that they meet the special circumstances required to sue for divorce in Japan. The lack of clear rules has placed prospective plaintiffs under emotional stress as they await a court’s decision on where their suits should take place, said Tokyo-based lawyer Tomohiro Hayase. Under what circumstances have spouses been able to file for divorce in Japan? A plaintiff in Japan who fled an allegedly abusive marriage abroad may qualify to have a family court hear the case because unconditionally prioritizing the whereabouts of the defendant can incur problems, Hayase said. “For example, in cases where a Japanese wife has fled her abusive foreign husband and moved back to Japan, it would be unfair if she has to return to the husband’s country to start divorce (proceedings) against him,” the lawyer said. Under such circumstances, domestic family courts have customarily decided they will handle the plaintiffs’ cases in Japan — even if the defendants are abroad — in accordance with what the top court called “the idea of fairness between the parties and just and speedy hearing of the case.” What new rules are being considered? The Legislative Council, an advisory panel to the justice minister, has come up with seven scenarios under which domestic family courts would preside over cross-border divorces in Japan, including those in which both parties are Japanese nationals. Other cases include those in which a couple lived in Japan until just before they were separated internationally — a rule Hayase said will make it easier for Japanese to initiate a divorce action against a spouse who left Japan. While this will be a common scenario, the nationality is in fact irrelevant: It could involve two Americans, one of whom continues to reside in Japan and initiates the action. Until now it has been hard for a Japanese husband, for example, to file for divorce if his foreign wife deserts him, leaves the country and does not inform him where she is. This is because regardless of any culpability the residence of the wife — the defendant in this case — took priority. The husband would traditionally have to go through reams of paperwork to persuade a family court that he is not to blame for a failed marriage to win jurisdiction over his case. But the new rule, if realized, will grant him the right to initiate proceedings in Japan merely on the grounds that he shared a Japanese address with her before they separated. “Although beneficial to Japanese, the rule is likely to prove more of an inconvenience to foreigners who left Japan for whatever reason, because unlike before, under the new rule it would be possible to drag them into a court battle in Japan from abroad — even though they are the defendants,” Hayase said. What will change if the rules are enacted? The council said the rules will “improve the foreseeability of litigants” and “contribute to swiftly resolving conflicts.” Hayase agrees. “Whenever clients who sought an international divorce came to us for consultation, we weren’t able to tell them for sure beforehand whether they could proceed with a lawsuit in Japan. All we could do was study past court rulings and do some guesswork,” he said, noting most of his Japanese clients preferred to file for divorce in Japan to avoid the hassle of dealing with a foreign language and having to fly overseas. “If more precise determinations are possible, that would be a huge load off their shoulders.” What else does the outline cover? Subject to the council’s discussion was not only jurisdiction over divorces but also child custody rulings. Family courts have customarily claimed jurisdiction over cross-border custody battles if the child is in Japan. The proposed rule by the council endorses this tradition, declaring that Japanese courts are authorized to handle such cases when “the child has an address in or is staying in Japan.” However, should the child be repatriated abroad in the midst of a custody battle, such as one under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, Japanese courts are likely to have to terminate the debate and relinquish jurisdiction to their overseas counterparts, said Muneki Uchino, councilor of the Civil Affairs Bureau at the Justice Ministry. Uchino said the Justice Ministry will compile an amendment based on the outline and submit it to the Diet “as soon as possible,” at the latest by early next year. How many international marriages take place in Japan? There were 21,130 new international marriages registered in Japan in 2014, according to data released by the welfare ministry in September. Of the total, 14,998 couples were those between Japanese husbands and foreign wives, mostly Chinese, Koreans and Filipinos. The remaining 6,132 were of Japanese wives, with the foreign husbands predominantly Americans and Koreans. There were 14,135 international divorces in 2014.",

    "source": "U.S. government sued over skull-crushing fall of massive pine cone <eos> DENVER - A military veteran who said his skull was crushed by a 16-pound (7-kg) pine cone as he rested in the shade of a conifer grove at a San Francisco park has sued the U.S. government, saying employee negligence led to his injuries. Sean Mace was reading and napping beneath the bunya pines, also known as false monkey puzzle trees, during a visit to San Francisco Maritime National Historic Park in October 2014, according to the lawsuit, filed in federal court. The cones dropped by the Australian trees can grow in excess of 14 inches (35 cm) in diameter and weigh more than 40 pounds (18 kg). Park staffers who planted the trees decades ago knew there was a high risk of injury to anyone below them, the complaint said. Mace, a U.S. Navy veteran, was rushed to San Francisco General Hospital, where he had two rounds of surgery for traumatic brain injury. The lawsuit said he had been left with “severe and likely irreversible cognitive defects.” It seeks monetary damages for personal injury and losses caused by “the negligent or wrongful act of omission of any employee,” and names the park, the U.S. government, the National Park Service and the Department of Interior as defendants. It alleged that inaction by workers “created a hidden hazard or peril” for visitors to the park, and that a safety barrier was erected around the bunya pine grove in the northeastern part of the park only after Mace suffered his injuries. The lawsuit was filed last month but was first reported on Monday by the San Francisco Chronicle. The newspaper said Mace, who is in his 50s, had chosen the waterfront park to try to find a quiet spot to watch the Blue Angels air show during last year’s Bay Area Fleet Week. The National Park Service said it did not comment on ongoing litigation.",

Yukihiro Saito denied his son Riku sufficient food and water from around the fall of 2006, and left him to die of malnutrition at their apartment in Atsugi, Kanagawa Prefecture, in January 2007, according to the ruling handed down in a lay judge trial. Saito left his son’s body at the apartment, where more than seven years later police found the boy’s skeletal remains in May 2014. “The boy was left to die in an uncomfortable environment filled with garbage without being given food by his father who was the only person he could rely on,” presiding judge Koji Inaba said. “The cruelty is beyond all imagination.” Saito told police his wife left him in 2004 and he locked the boy up in the apartment when he went out. He denied intending to kill the boy. The ruling also said Saito did not tell his employer about his son’s death and swindled ¥410,000 ($3,400) in child allowance payments. Prosecutors charged him with murder and fraud and sought 20 years in prison. The incident called into question local authorities’ failure to keep track of the boy for such a long time, exposing shortcomings in the system and how a child could disappear unnoticed.",

Yeti, sasquatch, ape-man, Bigfoot. No matter the name, sightings have been reported in virtually every U.S. state, with more than 100 listed in New York and more than 250 in neighboring Ohio. Washington state leads, with more than 600 reports, according to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Association. At the fourth annual Chautauqua Lake Bigfoot Expo, organizer Peter Wiemer knows the creature may not be the first topic that comes to mind in the rural county, best known for the Chautauqua Institution, a summer retreat devoted to scholarly and artistic pursuits. “You say ‘Bigfoot’ in a room full of people and watch everyone stop and look to see who’s talking,” he said with a laugh. And while he may have started the event as a way to draw people to the tourist-dependent region and his family’s rental cottages, he said he has since met dozens of people who are certain they’ve seen one of the ape-like creatures in the area. Wiemer is now enough of a devotee that he has tried to get New York state to put Sasquatch on its list of endangered species, alongside the mud turtle, the golden eagle and the cougar. The Department of Environmental Conservation isn’t convinced. Its 2012 response in part: “This mythical animal does not exist in nature or otherwise. . . . No program or action in relation to mythical animals is warranted.” Don’t tell that to Julia Karanasky, who was afraid she had a spy when she became aware of a large figure clearing his throat outside her bedroom window on her second night in her Niagara Falls home in 2009. Then she heard the stories of regular Bigfoot sightings on the nearby Tuscarora Indian Reservation. “I keep telling people, ‘I think he came to my house that night,’ ” said Karanasky, who sat in the front row for the expo’s lectures. Speakers included Steve Kulls, an Adirondacks-based Sasquatch detective who debunks Bigfoot hoaxes while seeking out credible reports, and Ken Gerhard, a cryptozoologist in pursuit of evidence of mystery creatures including the Loch Ness Monster, the chupacabra and werewolves. Dave Wargo said that years ago he smelled the pungent beast before he saw it standing on railroad tracks near the Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania. “People make fun of you,” said Wargo, who has appeared on Animal Planet’s “Finding Bigfoot” series. “But I know what I saw.”",

    "source": "Osaka elections pull LDP closer to old foes <eos> OSAKA - In an unprecedented move that has left many senior Liberal Democratic Party members concerned, the Osaka chapter of the Japanese Communist Party has called on its members to back the LDP’s candidates in the Nov. 22 mayoral and gubernatorial elections. The mayoral election pits former Ishin no To Diet member Hirofumi Yoshimura, a close confidant of Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto backed by the group Osaka Ishin no Kai (One Osaka), against the LDP’s pick, Osaka Municipal Assemblyman Akira Yanagimoto. The gubernatorial election sees the incumbent Ichiro Matsui, a close Hashimoto ally, pitted against former LDP Assemblywoman Takako Kurihara. But the mayoral election is considered the real battle. The decision by the JCP, which often enjoys a closer behind-the-scenes relationship with the LDP at the local level than is generally understood, to not field its own candidate in favor of Yanagimoto and Kurihara comes as the communists seek an “All Osaka” coalition of parties to defeat Yoshimura. Before a May referendum on whether to merge the wards of the city of Osaka, Yanagimoto was the public face of the anti-merger movement, often appearing alongside JCP assembly members on televised debates with Hashimoto, who has made the merger one of his key political goals. The referendum was defeated by just over 10,000 votes out of more than 1.4 million cast, thanks to the combined efforts of the anti-Osaka Ishin parties. Osaka Ishin is Hashimoto’s local political group. When Yanagimoto then decided to run against Yoshimura after Hashimoto announced he would not stand for re-election, the JCP decided that, rather than run the risk of splitting the opposition with its own candidate, it would back Yanagimoto. Katsutoshi Yamaguchi, chair of the JCP’s Osaka prefectural branch, said the party supports Yanagimoto because of his trenchant opposition to Hashimoto and his group’s merger plan. “Osaka Ishin has said it will once again attempt to push the merger if Yoshimura is re-elected. Yanagimoto has strongly criticized this stance and said he wants to return to a less confrontational city administration. “He has also made it clear that he wants to reach out to other political parties. So, JCP members are being encouraged to individually support him in order to put an end to Osaka Ishin’s politics,” Yamaguchi said. Nine of the 85 members of the Osaka Municipal Assembly, and three of the 88 prefectural assembly members, belong to the JCP, which claims to have about 440,000 supporters within the prefecture. For his part, Yanagimoto has been trying to distance himself somewhat from the JCP’s endorsement, partially because local LDP voters are split over whether to support or oppose an anti-merger stance. After the May 17 referendum, exit polls by the Asahi Shimbun showed that 42 percent of LDP-affiliated voters cast ballots for the merger, defying the party. “It’s a strange situation in Osaka. Many LDP members are uneasy over the JCP endorsement, and there are also those who support Hashimoto’s goal of integrating Osaka. They may not vote for Yanagimoto,” said an Osaka LDP official, speaking anonymously. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has already been to Osaka to endorse Yanagimoto and Kurihara. But how enthusiastic both Abe and LDP headquarters are about that support, given that a Yanagimoto victory will bring the LDP’s Osaka chapter even closer to the opposition, is unclear. In addition, Abe has forged closer relations with Hashimoto and Osaka Gov. Ichiro Matsui, who is standing for re-election against local LDP-backed candidate Takako Kurihara, whom the JCP is also calling on members to support. The Osaka Ishin group holds a plurality in the city assembly but must work with entities like Komeito, the third-largest party, to pass legislation. Komeito has supported Hashimoto in past elections but has not officially endorsed either candidate yet. Given the bad blood between Hashimoto, who also favors merging the city with the prefecture, and Komeito, which along with the LDP and JCP opposes it, one of the keys to the election will be how many Komeito voters, especially those who belong to the lay Buddhist group Soka Gakkai, its main backer, cast ballots for Yanagimoto. Some might choose to back Yoshimura in the hope that he’ll be more flexibe with Komeito’s concerns about the merger plan than Hashimoto ever was. Whether Osaka Ishin should continue pushing to merge Osaka is one of the main issues in the double election. In May, 13 of Osaka’s 24 districts voted against it. Virtually all the wards opposing the merger are in the city’s less glamorous and prosperous southern area, home to traditional merchant neighborhoods and small businesses. The more prosperous wards of northern Osaka, almost all of which voted for the merger, include areas that are home to major corporations and luxury hotels and shopping areas that attract residents from all over Kansai and beyond. The southern wards worry that a merger will cost them vital tax revenue they receive under the current 24-ward system, which would leave them at an even greater economic disadvantage if they are forced to compete with their richer northern counterparts for new revenue under Hashimoto’s proposal. The other issue that has emerged in recent days, however, is an LDP proposal backed by its senior Diet members, to turn the area into a mega-region that would ensure the line for a magnetically levitated train system now under construction, is extended to Osaka. Osaka Ishin has criticized the plan for being little more than an ill-considered political ploy. “Does the LDP really think that the maglev train will be built based on the vague contents of the proposal they put out?” asked Yoshimura. For his part, Yanagimoto and the LDP are emphasizing that they are willing to work to improve municipal services in Osaka and avoid redundancies without resorting to a merger. They want discussions with not only the city, but also the prefecture and the city of Sakai on how to do it; Osaka Ishin insists on a merger. “The purpose of these meetings is to find areas where the three bureaucracies can eliminate redundant services through mutual agreement. But Osaka Ishin members are only thinking about a merger, and are determined to hold another merger referendum despite their loss in May,” he told supporters earlier this month.",

    "source": "Kyoto advances nuclear-free agenda with Alaska LNG pact <eos> KYOTO - The Kyoto Prefectural Government signed an agreement with Alaska last month to explore the possibility of importing liquid natural gas from the state to Maizuru, a port city on the Sea of Japan. While daunting financial and bureaucratic challenges mean it will still be a while before Alaskan LNG flows to Kyoto, the agreement represents a step forward for Kyoto to achieve a larger goal: ending prefectural dependence on nuclear power by 2040. The strategy, as outlined by Kyoto Gov. Keiji Yamada, calls for building up LNG facilities at Maizuru and installing new LNG pipelines in the Kansai region. The prefecture envisions Maizuru supplying not only Kyoto, but other prefectures in the region with gas to replace Fukui Prefecture’s nuclear power plants as a major source of electricity. Kyoto is not alone in seeking to replace atomic power with a combination of LNG imports and renewable energy. As of the end of 2014, more than 600 local governments nationwide had declared their intent to be nuclear-free, although not all of have set specific dates like Kyoto, and many lack a strategic plan for achieving that goal. Yamada listed several reasons why the prefecture needs to end its usage of nuclear power, which comes mostly from 11 Kansai Electric Power Co. reactors in neighboring Fukui. “We’re grateful to Fukui for hosting nuclear power plants. But given issues like what to do with spent nuclear fuel and the need to decommission older reactors, we in Kyoto have to think about our energy future,” Yamada said in 2013, when he first announced the plan. Just prior to the memorandum of understanding with Alaska, the governor also said that, in addition to helping the prefecture get out of nuclear power, increasing natural gas usage via the port of Maizuru would have regional benefits. “In the event of a national disaster off the Pacific coast of Kansai, it’s possible that LNG facilities in the Osaka Bay area will be destroyed. Maizuru could then serve as a major natural gas hub,” he said. At present, Niigata is the only prefecture on the Sea of Japan coast that has the facilities needed to serve as an LNG base. In Kansai, the ports of Sakai, Osaka Prefecture, and Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, have LNG facilities. Kyoto and Hyogo, along with Osaka Gas, Kepco, and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, agreed in early September to formally research the cost of building an LNG pipeline from Maizuru to Sanda, Hyogo Prefecture, that could then supply other parts of Kansai and likely lead to other localities needing less nuclear power.",

    "source": "Could Hamp's detention reinforce prejudice? <eos> The Metropolitan Police Department arrested Julie Hamp, Toyota Motor Corp.’s first female managing officer, on June 18 on suspicion of importing oxycodone, an opioid used to relieve pain. The drug is tightly controlled in Japan but can be imported into the country with a prescription if certain procedures are followed. Hamp has since tendered her resignation via a lawyer, according to a statement posted on Toyota’s website on Wednesday. She hasn’t been able to speak with the company directly because she has been in detention since her arrest. According to weekly magazine Shukan Shincho, Hamp is being held in a detention cell at a police station not far from the United Nations University in Tokyo’s Shibuya Ward. She hasn’t been formally charged yet and the odds are very high that she will be held for the entire 23 days allowed under Japanese law. Hamp told prosecutors she had the powerful painkiller shipped from the U.S. to ease problems with her knees, The Japan Times reported Wednesday, noting that her father is believed to have mailed the package to her. Hamp claims she was unaware she was breaking the law. It doesn’t matter — once prosecutors have filed formal charges, a guilty verdict is almost certain. The country has a conviction rate that exceeds 99 percent, which has been attributed to prosecutors presenting judges with only the most obviously guilty cases. Those in detention are routinely treated as if they are guilty and if suspects don’t know how the system works on their first day inside, they soon learn quickly from other inmates. Suspects who protest their innocence are treated badly. Suspects who don’t confess to committing a crime are unlikely to be granted bail at all. If prosecutors decide to file formal charges, a suspect could be held in detention until their trial — which could be months away. What is life like in the police detention cells? Suspects are put in a cell with several other inmates. They’re not allowed to call each other by name, only by a number. Inmates wake up at 6 a.m.; they go to bed at 9 p.m. The food is always served cold, except on rare occasions. Suspects aren’t allowed access to a phone, iPod or computer. They generally aren’t allowed reading materials unless they are in Japanese. Suspects are allowed one 20-minute visit per day, excluding their lawyer. They have the right to remain silent but don’t have the right to have an attorney present. The lights in the cells are kept on all night. Inmates are not allowed to cover their heads. The police can interrogate suspects for as long as they like, although they generally restrict this to no more than eight hours a day. The monotony, poor treatment, isolation and despair that suspects experience in detention are enough to make many jump at any chance to be released before their trial. It has resulted in “confessions” that have later proven false. Hamp is likely to still be in detention at the time this article is published. At first, Toyota was very supportive of her. President Akio Toyoda apologized for the incident at a news conference, saying he believed Hamp had no intention of breaking the law. “To me, executives and staff are like my children,” he said. “It’s the responsibility of a parent to protect their children.” His unabashed support for his ‘child’ did not sit well with the police, who probably felt as if they had lost face. They raided Toyota’s offices on June 23. The police have judiciously leaked information to bolster their case since the arrest and the country’s newspapers have had no hesitation in reporting it under headlines such as “Medical exam shows no need for painkiller,” “Police fearlessly take on Goliath company” and the vaguely xenophobic “Diversification a problem for Japan.” In the end, Toyota accepted her resignation on July 1, because of “the concerns and inconvenience that recent events have caused our stakeholders.” Does anyone really believe that a high-paid executive of Toyota was smuggling oxycodone into Japan in an attempt to get high or, worse, sell it to a third party? However, the police and the prosecutors aren’t bad people — they’re just doing their job. In 2002, Briton Nicholas Baker was accused of smuggling drugs but he claimed he was set up by another man, James Prunier. The police in Belgium, who were pursuing Prunier, wanted to provide evidence to courts in Japan that might have exonerated Baker. However, the prosecutors refused to accept the evidence. After persistent nagging, a representative from the Chiba Prosecutor’s Office met with me. I asked him why the prosecution refused to talk to the Belgian police. He looked at me, dumbfounded. “We have everything we need to win this case,” he said. “Why would we want evidence that weakens it?” Prosecutors don’t seem to care so much about justice — it all comes down to winning the case. Hamp may simply be on the losing side; her guilt or innocence is irrelevant. That said, the arrest took place after a meeting of Toyota stockholders, suggesting that the police showed some concern for the corporation. National Police Agency sources say Eriko Yamatani, chairman of the Public Safety Commission, which oversees the country’s police force, was consulted as well before the arrest. This in of itself isn’t odd — Toyota is a major pillar of the domestic economy. It’s worth noting, however, that weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun has previously accused Yamatani of being associated with Zaitokukai, an ultranationalist group that has been condemned by the United Nations, the United States and the National Police Agency. In the end, Hamp will probably confess — almost everyone does. Unfortunately, however, her “confession” may only serve to reinforce Zaitokukai’s view that non-Japanese are nothing but trouble. There’s another word for a presumption of guilt or preconceived opinion that is not reasonable: prejudice.",

This was for presenting his likeness to the Emperors, Presidents and Kings of our treaty powers, and also for giving them to the schools of all grades in the Empire. Imperial artists Kuroda, Maruki and Ogawa had the honor of photographing his Majesty, and tens of thousands of copies will be prepared before October next. 75 YEARS AGO Wednesday, July 10, 1940 U.S. Marines arrest Japanese gendarmes U.S. marines in Shanghai committed outrageous acts against plain clothes Japanese gendarmes escorting General Toshizo Nishio, commander-in-chief of the Japanese expeditionary forces in China, on Sunday while the General was inspecting the Shanghai International Settlement and French Concessions on the occasion of the third anniversary of the China Affair, report special dispatches to the Asahi and Yomiuri. Japanese gendarmes in plain clothes, numbering 16 were outrageously attacked by American marines with bayoneted guns, and despite nonresistance by the Japanese officers of the law they were unduly taken over to the headquarters of the American marines to be kept in detention, it is reported. Some of the Japanese were reported wounded in the attacks. The area Nishio was visiting is included in an American policing area and the gendarmes were reportedly detained because they were armed with revolvers. Japanese military authorities immediately lodged a written protest with Captain Peck of the American marines. According to the American attitude dealing with this affair, the Japanese military authorities are determined to take decisive steps. The Japanese were detained until 4:30 p.m. on Sunday, when they were only released after strong protests by Japanese military officers. The U.S. Marines were eventually withdrawn from Shanghai, in November 1941, days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. 50 YEARS AGO Friday, July 30, 1965 Teen detained after 8-hour shooting spree An 18-year-old ex-seaman staged a Wild West-style gun battle in the heart of Tokyo Thursday in a desperate effort to avoid arrest for the killing of a police officer earlier in the day. He kept more than 100 armed policemen at bay for an hour and a half, shooting at random from inside a gun shop near Shibuya Station, at the end of an eight-hour shooting spree that began in Yamato, west of Yokohama, shortly before noon. Using tear gas, police finally apprehended the youth at the Royal Gun Shop, located between the station and the National Olympic Swimming Stadium at 7:20 p.m. Twelve persons were wounded by the youth before he was taken into custody. The youth, identified by police only by age and occupation, held three persons hostage in the shop. He used rifles taken from the shop to fire at the police. Four police officers and six spectators were wounded by stray bullets during the battle. Finally, at 6:50 p.m., police started firing tear gas into the gun shop. They eventually overpowered him at 7:20 p.m. Eight hours earlier, the youth had shot and killed a police officer, Yasuo Tadokoro, 20, with a rifle near a housing complex in Yamato. Tadokoro had been sent to the area after an emergency call to his police box that a young man carrying a rifle was loitering in the area. After his arrest, the youth told police he had been shooting birds in a wooded area when the police officer came up and began questioning him. When the officer appeared to reach for his pistol, the boy shot him. The youth then changed into the police officer’s uniform and took his pistol. He then stopped a passing motorist and had the driver take him to a nearby town. The youth reportedly changed cars twice before being spotted at Koganei Park, west of Tokyo, where he managed to evade capture by some 300 police officers. He then appeared in Shibuya at around 5:40 p.m., where after running out of ammunition, he entered the gun shop. The tall and stoutly built youth is the son of a carpenter. He lives a few kilometers from Shibuya. 25 YEARS AGO Monday, July 2, 1990 Jobs becoming easier, less interesting Technological developments have improved labor conditions but Japanese workers find their jobs less interesting, according to a survey released Sunday by the Prime Minister’s Office. The Survey Regarding Scientific Technology and Society, which polled 3,000 Japanese men and women over the age of 18, also shows that many Japanese believe the nation lacks the training environment needed to produce scientists with “individualistic and creative” character. The surveyors asked respondents how their jobs have changed, either through the use of robots or other labor-saving technology. When asked if working conditions have improved, 47.6 percent responded positively, up 7.7 percent from the same survey in 1987, while 13.6 percent said conditions have worsened. The percentage of workers who find their work interesting decreased by 4.7 percentage points to 41.9 percent. Also, 58.1 percent said that the training environment for Japanese scientists is unable to produce individualistic and creative scientists, while 53.9 percent said it is difficult for Japan to acquire its own awareness of scientific technology.",

    "source": "The new face of Japanese beauty products <eos> A wise woman once said that beauty is pain, but that doesn’t mean that it has to be boring. With designer face masks, even the simple act of skin moisturizing can become fun. Face masks rose to popularity after the 2011 Korean BB Cream craze . Over the past four years, the “lazy girl” alternative to traditional, time-consuming facials has been gaining prominence worldwide. Coated in serums containing everything from collagen and hyaluronic acid to more adventurous ingredients such as snail extract, these face masks claim to moisturize and brighten one’s skin. To stand out, face mask makers gradually started to experiment with different designs, such as cute pandas or classic kabuki makeup. Inspired by Japanese cosplay (“costume play”), they serve not only as a beauty essential, but also as fun way to remake yourself, if only for 15 to 20 minutes. These face masks seemed to hit their stride this year. According to a PR representative from beauty company Pure Smile, design face masks first came to being when faced with the question of how to make regular, white face masks more attractive. Fashion icon Kansai Yamamoto was recruited to design a line of colorful kabuki- themed face masks in March, and beauty company Pure Smile recently teamed up with special makeup artist JIRO to concoct three ghoulish designs for their “Art Mask” line. Prisoner No. 0, Test Subject No. 13 and Type A Zombie were released in early June. Artist JIRO is already well known for his makeup skills that have transformed models from animals to aliens. In the latest installation to the Pure Smile “Art Mask,” line JIRO lives up to his name by making face masks that nobody would be afraid to answer the door with. Even Japan’s favorite pear fairy Funassyi has made his mark on the designer face-mask trend, with a limited-edition Funassyi face mask included in one of Pure Smile’s face mask packs. Of course, there is a built-in marketing value here. Once a private matter, the design mask begs for a selfie to be shared. Pure Smile is even holding an Art Mask Photo Contest . Art mask enthusiasts can post their pictures to Instagram or Twitter with the hashtag #アートマスクコンテスト, and Pure Smile will select the winners.

    "source": "Surfing the waves between two worlds <eos> In a Tokyo lab, a remarkable experiment is exploring the meeting of worlds. This is not a boring old metaphor for a meeting between East and West, it’s a description of the interface between the world we live in and the frankly insane world of quantum objects. Quantum physics is famously difficult. Renowned Danish physicist Niels Bohr described it ominously: “Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum mechanics cannot possibly have understood it.” I’ll try not to let that put me off. Today, I’m going to explore a small part of the quantum world, courtesy of the laboratory of Yasuhiro Ohshima in the Department of Chemistry at Tokyo Institute of Technology. To say quantum physics is difficult to understand is an understatement. However, it underpins our world and even a hint at its incredible power makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. “The heart of quantum physics is that particles also behave like waves,” Ohshima says. “Our work clearly demonstrated this experimentally.” Before I go over the work Ohshima has done, let’s look at the fact that matter and light can behave both as a particle and as a wave. More than 100 years ago, German physicist Max Planck discovered that energy is not continuous but is, instead, divided into packages, or quanta. Einstein then showed that light, at its most basic level, also comes in packages, or photons. It’s often observed that works of genius are achieved at a precocious age. Einstein, for example, won his Nobel prize for work carried out in his 20s. And so it is with quantum physics. One of its architects was a young German called Werner Heisenberg. Heisenberg realized that fundamental particles such as electrons don’t always exist. Sounds crazy, right? It’s no wonder that scientists still struggle with the implications of quantum physics a century later. What’s really crazy, however, is that Heisenberg was right. As Italian physicist Carlo Rovelli writes in his new book, “Seven Brief Lessons on Physics,” “it’s as if God had not designed reality with a line that was heavily scored, but just dotted it with a faint outline.” We’re not even saying everything we know is built on quicksand. Our foundations are even more precarious — even more uncertain. How can the basis of reality not be solid? I don’t understand the equations that describe this result, but I grasp the meaning and it leaves me both dizzy and exhilarated. Fortunately for us and all objects bigger than subatomic particles, reality is quite secure — we are not likely to wink out of existence suddenly. It’s now time to examine the work of Ohshima and his colleague, Kenta Mizuse, at the Institute for Molecular Science, National Institutes of Natural Sciences. They have managed to capture an image of a spinning molecule of nitrogen — no easy feat, since the molecule was rotating at 100 billion times per second. Nitrogen gas is obviously going to behave like a particle, as it is made of two rather large atoms stuck together. However, it is still governed by the rules of the quantum world. “It is usually more difficult to see the quantum behavior of atoms than that of electrons, because of the atoms’ much heavier masses,” Ohshima says. By using a laser to capture an image of the spinning molecule, Ohshima and Mizuse saw the molecule showing wave-like behavior, the first time this has been achieved experimentally. The work is published in the journal Science Advances. Ohshima and Mizuse say the result will help develop more sophisticated molecular manipulations, such as an ultrafast molecular “stopwatch.” However, what I like about it is that they saw the fuzzy, shifting interface between our familiar world and the bizarre world of quantum physics. In the world of quantum physics, it’s not possible to say where anything is. We are unable to determine where an object is, exactly, unless we observe it. It turns out it’s only possible to say that something will probably be at a certain place. It might not seem like much, but the shock is still sinking in 100 years later. Physicists used to have a world that was complicated, but at least it fitted together predictably, like a huge clockwork mechanism. Now the world is built on a ghostly, mysterious foundation. We don’t have to fully understand it — thank goodness — but quantum mechanics is here to stay. Because of it, I can write this on my laptop. Transistors, microprocessors, LEDs, lasers, magnetic imaging in hospitals, electron microscopes — they are all applications of quantum physics at work. Novelist Natsume Soseki — he who adorns the ¥1,000 bill — gave a lecture at Tokyo Higher Technical School in 1914 ( bit.ly/1CvicIo ). The school would go on to become Tokyo Institute of Technology, and Soseki’s words are still remembered to this day, despite the fact that he opened by saying, “I cannot speak of anything interesting … and my talk has no title.” “You aim to reduce distances between destinations, save time, make lives easier,” Soseki told the students. “That is what you do. Literature, art, music and theater, on the other hand, exhaust human energy. That is what I do. I do not measure anything in terms of time or distance.” Soseki went on to illustrate how the two apparently different breeds — artists and scientists — could learn from each other. It is often said that a wall exists between art and science but, 100 years later, Soseki’s words at the institute remind us that the barriers are not insurmountable.",

    "source": "NHTSA fines Fiat Chrysler record $105 mlllion over safety recall lapses <eos> WASHINGTON - The U.S. auto safety watchdog, toughening its stance against manufacturer defects, announced on Sunday a record $105 million in fines against Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV over lapses in safety recalls involving millions of vehicles. The Italian-U.S. automaker’s consent agreement with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration contains an unprecedented buyback option covering hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including more than 1 million Jeep sport utility vehicles, whose owners can receive a trade-in or a financial incentive to get their vehicles repaired. Fiat Chrysler also agreed to submit to an independent monitor’s audit of its recall performance over a three-year period. The $105 million in fines sets a new standard for NHTSA’s dealings with car manufacturers, eclipsing the previous record fine of $70 million imposed against Honda Motor Co. in January for failing to report death, injury and other claims. Last year, General Motors Co. was ordered to pay $35 million for a decade-long delay in reporting faulty ignition switches tied to more than 120 deaths. NHTSA has taken a more aggressive enforcement posture under its new administrator, Mark Rosekind, after coming under fire from leaders of both parties in Congress for lapses in its handling of deadly defects, including Takata Corp. air bag inflators and GM ignition switches. “Fiat Chrysler’s pattern of poor performance put millions of its customers and the driving public at risk,” Rosekind said in a statement. “This action will provide relief to owners of defective vehicles, will help improve recall performance throughout the auto industry, and gives Fiat Chrysler the opportunity to embrace a proactive safety culture.” The recalled vehicles covered by the agreement include Dodge Ram, Dakota and Chrysler Aspen trucks from model years as early as 2008. More than half a million of the vehicles subject to buybacks have faulty suspension parts that can cause a loss of control. Fiat Chrysler’s U.S. unit, FCA US LLC, formerly Chrysler Group LLC, said it accepted the consequences of the agreement with “renewed resolve to improve our handling of recalls and re-establish the trust our customers place in us.” The fines include a $70 million cash payment, an agreement that Fiat Chrysler will spend $20 million improving its recall process and an additional $15 million payable if the automaker is found to have committed any further violations. The two sides have been engaged in discussions since NHTSA held a July 2 public hearing on Fiat Chrysler’s recall performance. At the proceedings, NHTSA staff cataloged alleged failures in 23 separate recalls, including what they termed misleading behavior, while an FCA executive pledged to work with the agency to improve the automaker’s recall programs. Fiat Chrysler has had a contentious relationship with NHTSA for years, pushing back on the agency’s efforts to secure recalls and threatening lawsuits to avoid mandatory action, according to former auto regulators. Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne told reporters this month that the company needs to change the way it deals with regulators going forward. “We are intent on rebuilding our relationship with NHTSA,” the automaker said on Sunday.",

    "source": "Fertile eggs produced through donation from anonymous women <eos> Two women with ovarian problems have produced fertile eggs through in vitro fertilization using sperm from their husbands and eggs donated from anonymous females, a nonprofit organization supporting fertility treatment said Monday. While there have been 24 cases in Japan in which women have given birth by using sperm from their husbands and eggs from their sisters or friends, it is the first time that complete strangers had donated the eggs. The development could bring attention to a host of issues Japan needs to deal with over egg donation, including ensuring the rights of children to know about their origins and compensation for health problems that donors could face when offering eggs. The fertile eggs will undergo screening for hepatitis and other diseases before being implanted in the two female patients — both in their 30s and suffering from premature menopause — possibly by the end of this year. The donors are also in their 30s and have children. The children to be born will be notified before they enter elementary school that people other than their mothers have donated eggs, according to Kobe-based NPO OD-Net, or Oocyte Donation Network. If the children wish to do so, they can also learn about the donors when the reach the age of 15. The organization quoted one of the donors as saying she offered her eggs in the hope she can “help couples having a hard time in fertility treatment.” One of the patients said in a statement: “I am overwhelmed with gratitude toward the donor. Now it is my turn to try hard.” OD-Net in January 2013 started soliciting volunteers under age 35 to donate eggs on an anonymous basis to women who can’t produce eggs due to illnesses but are capable of giving birth. Because two cases satisfied medical conditions, OD-Net said in April this year that an ethics panel of an institution consisting of fertility treatment clinics gave the green light to their treatment. On in vitro fertilization involving people other than a couple, a health ministry panel said in a 2003 report that eggs should be donated only from an anonymous third person because receiving eggs from a close person could complicate family relationships. But it has been nearly impossible for individuals to find an anonymous egg donor. With no laws or regulations on egg donations, patients’ sisters or friends have usually become donors. Sachiko Kishimoto, the head of OD-Net, said: “There are mixed reactions to in vitro fertilization involving people other than a married couple, but I want people to know there are many couples wishing (to undergo the treatment). “We want (the government) to swiftly prepare laws, thinking about people who are donating eggs without being paid and without compensation,” she said.",

    "source": "Consumers slow to embrace generic drugs <eos> In May, the health ministry announced that it would set a new target for the use of generic pharmaceuticals. In 2013, 46.9 percent of the prescription drugs dispensed in Japan were generics, and at first the ministry said it wanted to raise this portion to 60 percent by 2017, but the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, which advises the ministry on fiscal matters, insisted it speed up the process in order to curb runaway medical costs, and now the ministry says it will shoot for a target of 80 percent in line with the dispensing rate in Europe and the United States. Generics — cheaper versions of drugs whose patent protection has expired — tend to be more expensive in Japan than they are in other countries when compared to patent drugs with the same active ingredients. Because of the national health insurance system, drug prices in Japan are determined by the government, and prices for generics tend to be about 60 percent of the price for patent drugs, whereas in the U.S. generic prices are about 20 percent that for patent drugs. Insured Japanese consumers only pay 30 percent of the drug price out of pocket — 10 percent if they’re elderly — so the difference isn’t acutely felt and the urge to request generics not as strong. By pushing generics, the government hopes to save as much as ¥1.3 trillion a year, which is important since medical costs are continually rising, mainly due to drug costs. Overall medical expenses rose by 7 percent from 2009 to 2013. During that same period the money spent on drugs increased by more than 20 percent. As pointed out by journalist Mika Tsutsumi, who covers the U.S. health care situation, the Japanese government reviews drug prices every two years and the trend has been to reduce them, but Japanese physicians are prescribing more drugs. In addition, American companies have recently been successful in marketing drugs in Japan that have yet to be approved by the government and thus are very expensive. Patients can ask pharmacists for generics unless the doctor’s prescription expressly says that only a patent drug can be dispensed. The reason many don’t is that they have been conditioned to think that “brand name” drugs are safer and more effective than generic drugs, even though the health ministry says there is no appreciable difference. Tsutsumi reports that U.S. drug and insurance companies want to exploit this preference and are working to undermine Japan’s national health insurance system. That’s why they are pushing for the Trans-Pacific Partnership to be ratified, since it would activate the ability to sue governments for erecting trade barriers, and they consider national health insurance a trade barrier. Japanese doctors have also appeared in the media reinforcing this preference by claiming that generics are inferior to patents for various reasons, which may cause some people to think these doctors have a vested interest in the patent drugs they prescribe. The government addressed similar such concerns in the ’50s when it implemented the iyaku bungyo law in an attempt to “separate” pharmacies from medical institutions and by doing so stop doctors from buying prescription drugs in bulk at low prices and then selling them through their own clinics and hospitals. Since drug prices are set, it was thought these doctors were prescribing drugs unnecessarily and in large amounts in order to reap huge windfalls. The new law introduced incentives for pharmacists who set up businesses outside medical facilities. These monzen yakkyoku (literally, “outside-the-gate drug stores”) could charge more for dispensing drugs than in-house pharmacies could, and the scheme worked to a certain extent. By 2013, 67 percent of all the pharmacies in Japan were independent operations. However, the added cost is considerable. The independent pharmacy receives ¥410 as a special “preparation fee” from the government for each prescription filled, and another ¥410 for “record keeping.” Sankei Shimbun estimates that these additional fees cost the government ¥80 billion a year just for one popular hay fever medication. According to the law, the pharmacist advises the patient in the proper dosage and, more significantly, keeps records of the efficacy of the drug and any side effects. These tasks justify the added value, but they don’t have any practical meaning. Very few pharmacists have the inclination or the opportunity to follow up a patient with regard to how the drug works, but they are nevertheless required to keep a record of every person to whom they dispense drugs. The suspicion that few really do was borne out earlier this year when two drug store chains, Kusuri no Fukutaro and CFS Corp., were cited by police for not having kept any records at all. This isn’t to suggest that keeping records is a bad idea. It could prevent patients from mixing drugs that shouldn’t be mixed and avoiding overdoses, but there is no central system where this sort of data is made available to pharmacists and physicians. The record-keeping obligation is limited to each pharmacy, which is not compelled to share that information. Ideally, pharmacists are supposed to be in close contact with prescribing physicians, but that doesn’t happen either. As it stands, Japanese doctors typically do not release medical records to patients, because they don’t want them to be shared with other doctors. A Cabinet survey of consumers found that almost no one thinks the separation system has any merit. Some find it inconvenient since it means going out of one’s way to pick up drugs, which could be difficult for the elderly and people with disabilities. But as already pointed out, even if consumers think Japanese drug prices are abnormally high—which they are compared to prices in other countries—they seem reluctant to risk their health on generics. According to Tokyo Shimbun, one member of the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy has a solution: If patients insist on using patent drugs when equivalent generics are available and their physicians don’t expressly prescribe patents, then those patients should pay 100 percent of the cost. The major pharmaceutical companies would protest vehemently if such a condition were codified, but it sure would make generics popular.",

A pro surfer who coaches the Chinese National Surf Team and a tourism agency based in New Jersey plan a surfing expedition and training camp in North Korea, which has pristine beaches, virgin waves and, they say, the potential to become an international wave-riding destination. Nik Zanella, a native of Italy who along with coaching Chinese surfers is a representative of the International Surfing Association, said the decision to hold the surfing camp for a small group of North Koreans and foreign tourists along North Korea’s east coast follows a year of studying the area to assess wave and weather conditions. “The DPRK will not become the next Malibu, but it receives enough swells to sustain a vast surf community,” he said Tuesday, referring to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “Our goal is to evaluate the resources and make them available to local surfers in a sustainable and safe way. We are not there to simply go surf, brag about it and then bail.” The expedition, scheduled for September, has been approved by the North Korean government, which is eager to boost its small but developing tourism sector. Andrea Lee, CEO of Uri Tours, which is organizing the excursion, said it will be used to map out the coastline for prime surfing locations, take risk assessments and develop evacuation and safety plans. Though most North Koreans do not have the means or leisure time to devote themselves to recreational hobbies, she said the government is keen on getting the mapping data and on drawing tourists. “We want to open the DPRK as a surfing destination on a larger scale,” she said. “The hope is to create a foundation and to pave the way for future surfers.”",

Using “ojiballs,” players can catch aging pocket monsters, who have disturbing Kobito Dukan -like faces, and make them do their bidding.

If enough gold is harvested, players can build roads to the next town and find new Ojimon to catch. The game includes the original 150 Pokemon, with graying versions of Charizard, Haunter and Gyarados. Even though it’s not as exciting as battling wild monsters, your Ojimon can still gain experience points through their menial labor and evolve into more powerful forms, albeit with the same sad, unshaven faces. For an extra laugh (or to avoid copyright infringement), all of the monsters have been given punny names.

    "source": "Fiat Chrysler buy-back of unrepaired trucks may cost billions but it has resale option <eos> DETROIT - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles could pay billions of dollars to buy back defective trucks as part of a settlement with U.S. safety regulators, but has the option to recover costs by reselling vehicles once they are repaired. The auto safety watchdog on Sunday slapped the Italian-American automaker with a $105 million fine — the largest ever levied by U.S. regulators against a carmaker — over lapses in safety recalls involving millions of vehicles. FCA said on Monday that about 193,000 Ram trucks previously recalled for suspension and steering problems had not been repaired and were therefore eligible for the buyback deal negotiated with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That could put FCA on the hook for nearly $3 billion, if the average buyback price is $15,000 per vehicle. But the net cost could be much lower. A company representative noted on Monday that the NHTSA agreement gives FCA the option of repairing and reselling any vehicles it repurchases from owners. The automaker said in a statement on Monday that the net cost of the buyback program would not be “material to its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.” FCA shares were down 4.8 percent at $14.43 on Monday afternoon in New York trading. The fine and other provisions of the consent order are aimed at improving “the entire industry’s performance” on safety, said Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in a conference call with reporters on Monday. Rosekind was joined by U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, who flagged his own efforts to make NHTSA a “much more muscular agency” in dealing with the auto industry’s spotty record on recall repairs. In addition to the $105 million fine and vehicle buyback provision, FCA agreed to provide financial incentives to more than a million Jeep owners to bring their recalled vehicles in for repairs. The penalties address lapses spanning nearly two dozen recalls affecting more than 11 million vehicles, including older Jeeps with rear gasoline tanks linked to numerous fatal fires. In the consent order, NHTSA said FCA had failed to repair recalled vehicles within a reasonable time, and had failed to notify owners and the agency in a timely manner. The automaker also agreed to NHTSA’s appointment of an independent monitor to provide additional oversight of FCA’s recall activities. In the past week, the automaker has recalled more than 3 million U.S. vehicles, including 1.4 million to install software to prevent hackers from gaining remote control of the vehicles. NHTSA said on Friday it would investigate whether FCA’s solution to upgrade software was enough to protect consumers from hackers, although FCA said in its recall announcement that it was unaware of any injuries. Over the weekend, NHTSA also released details of two new FCA recalls, totaling more than 1.7 million vehicles, involving Ram pickups from model years 2012-2014 for inadvertent deployment of air bags.",

    "source": "The cafes play jazz deep in the heart of Kyoto <eos> Last month, it was announced the number of visitors to Kyoto in 2014 (including day trippers) topped 55 million people, a 7.8 percent increase over 2013. The total number of foreign visitors who spent at least one night was 1.83 million, a whopping 62 percent increase over 2013. In addition, Travel + Leisure magazine named Kyoto the world’s best city for the second year in a row. The magazine readers calls Kyoto the “quintessential Japanese experience,” noting there are more than 2,000 Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, the Golden Pavilion and the Nishijin neighborhood for “ kawaii (cute) artisan shops.” As someone who lived in Kyoto for nine years and returns quite often, I view the recent, rapid influx of tourists with mixed emotions. There is no doubt that, for mid-range tourists, the quality of shops, cafes, hotels and restaurants in the city is far better today than it was two decades ago. Higher-end tourists, as Travel + Leisure notes, now have the choice of staying in a traditional ryokan (as celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio do when they pass through) or a modern, four- or five-star hotel. A trip to Kyoto to see Japan’s “quintessential culture” — the tea ceremony, ikebana, a performance of noh or kabuki, and, of course, meditation at a Zen temple — entices those also seeking calm, quiet and time to contemplate and appreciate the finer things in life, be they religious, philosophical, artistic or culinary. In other words: You don’t come to Kyoto to experience Tokyo. Yet the recent tourist boom is transforming parts of Kyoto into some version of Tokyo’s Ginza or Aoyama neighborhoods, placing a strain on a city far smaller than the capital and not designed to handle large numbers of tourists. Want to enjoy the serenity of a Zen garden these days? So do the other 100 people in the scrum who are pushing you from behind, talking in loud voices and snapping selfies. Need to get across town quickly? Your choices are an expensive taxi fare or a bus. Either way, it can take up to 15 minutes to go a mere kilometer if the traffic is bad. Looking for a reasonably priced hotel during the cherry blossom season or the autumn months? Yeah, aren’t we all. Try Osaka or Shiga Prefecture — Kyoto’s booked. And want to take memorable photos of the main sites, just like the (people-free) ones you see in guidebooks? Double check first. Japanese shutterbugs report there’s been an increase in the number of Kyoto temples and shrines that now forbid photos, due to problems with groups of tourists. Yet the heart of Kyoto is not to be found in famed locations with large groups. It’s an individual discovery that happens by chance. It’s a stroll through a small temple smelling of incense or a cozy jazz bar beside it that owns hundreds of rare LPs with an owner who plays the shakuhachi and once met Miles Davis. It’s a cafe in a renovated machiya, where waitresses wear Indian sarongs, the background music is Flemish Renaissance or Tibetan spiritual, and the menu includes fair-trade coffee and Japanese sweets. It’s a modern restaurant where you fall into lively conversation with strangers over good wine or Kyoto-produced craft beer and sake. And it’s a musty old family-owned shop, selling something so uniquely “Kyoto” that you enter wondering how they stay in business and exit happy that they do. That’s the real Kyoto experience. It’s still out there, amid the famous landmarks, throngs of tourists, chain restaurants, souvenir shops and magazine editors. As with all good adventures, seek it out, and don’t be surprised when you find it in the most unlikely of places.",

    "source": "Tokyo hospitals to add five foreign doctors for expats <eos> The government will allow five non-Japanese doctors to practice at four hospitals in Tokyo from around December. Their patients will be limited to non-Japanese who agree to pay full costs themselves. The move, proposed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and approved by the central government on June 29, is part of a “special zone” deregulation initiative spearheaded by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Currently, doctors from the U.S., the U.K., France and Singapore can practice in Japan without a Japanese medical license under bilateral agreements with those nations, but they can only see patients of their own nationality. “As we have an Olympics coming up in Tokyo, we decided it is necessary to create an environment where foreign nationals can live in Tokyo without anxiety,” said Takafumi Kobayashi, head of the national strategic special zone coordination division at the metropolitan government. The plan will see foreign practitioners placed at institutions across the capital. St. Luke’s International Hospital in Tokyo’s Chuo Ward, as well as its branch clinic St. Luke’s MediLocus in Chiyoda Ward, will each hire an American doctor. Juntendo University Hospital in Bunkyo Ward will get two doctors, one American and one French, while Keio University Hospital in Shinjuku Ward will acquire one British doctor. The doctors, whose names and areas of expertise have yet to be announced, will be allowed to see patients of any nationality except Japanese. Foreign nationals covered by Japan’s public health insurance scheme can seek their services but will not be able to use the insurance, Kobayashi said. St. Luke’s projects that the hospital group’s two American doctors will see a total of 8,640 people in 2016. Kobayashi said the metropolitan government will consider expanding the list of such doctors if hospitals so request. Tatsuo Hatta, a member of an advisory panel headed by the prime minister that took up the metropolitan government’s special zone request, said that, though small, it is a major step toward breaking down the regulatory barriers in the heavily protected health care sector — and infusing it with diversity and fresh ideas. “Until now, non-Japanese doctors who were here under the bilateral agreements were of little use because they were only allowed to see patients from the same country they came from,” said Hatta, economist and president of the Fukuoka Prefecture-based think tank Asian Growth Research Institute.",

    "source": "Hashimoto's proposed Kansai-centric party no easy sell in region, where rivalries limit appeal <eos> OSAKA - No stranger to making headlines and raising eyebrows in politics, the fiery Toru Hashimoto did it again on July 4. The Osaka mayor, leader of the Osaka Ishin no Kai (One Osaka) local lawmaker group and founder of the whole Ishin movement told nearly 100 members of Osaka Ishin at a closed meeting: “I’m always ready to create a national party in Kansai.” That was followed by reports that the new “Kansai Ishin” party will be launched sometime in September — just a couple of weeks before the end of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s term as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Speculation has grown as to whether Abe will win another term, and thus remain prime minister, or whether he will be replaced. Ten days later, on July 14, a meeting took place in Osaka with 80 Ishin-affiliated local politicians from around the Kansai region. While the agenda was officially about ways in which the various Ishin local groups can cooperate to revitalize the Osaka Bay area, which extends into Hyogo Prefecture, a closed meeting was held afterward in which attendees were sounded out about the performance of Ishin no To (Japan Innovation Party). Concerns about the party’s Diet members becoming too “Tokyo-centric” and ignoring or playing down the concerns of Kansai’s Ishin members about regionalization and decentralization were aired by the attendees, many of whom expressed tentative support for a new Kansai-based national political party where local concerns did not get “lost in Nagatacho” — a reference to the Tokyo district that serves as the national political hub. “The attractive aspect of Ishin is that there is no strict hierarchy between national and local representatives,” said Hyogo Prefectural Assembly member Yugo Nakano after that meeting. The next formal step toward a Kansai Ishin party might be taken on Aug. 8, when Hashimoto will speak at a gathering of Ishin representatives in Kansai. Of Kansai’s six main prefectures (Kyoto, Shiga, Nara, Wakayama, Osaka and Hyogo), at the local assembly level there are nine Ishin members in Kyoto, two in Shiga, 10 in Nara, three in Wakayama, 143 in Osaka and 35 in Hyogo. There are 15 Ishin no To Diet members, including 12 from Osaka and three from Hyogo. And this, perhaps, is the greatest barrier to forming an “All Kansai” national party. The Ishin movement has always been centered on Osaka. There are no Ishin no To Diet members from Kyoto, Shiga, Nara or Wakayama prefectures, while Shiga has only two local Ishin members and Wakayama three. The reasons for Ishin’s lack of ability to gain a lot of support throughout Kansai are political, social and historical. First, both Osaka Ishin and the Ishin no To have stated that integration of Osaka City and Osaka Prefecture is a core issue. While that appeals to voters in Osaka, and to a certain extent in the urbanized parts of Hyogo Prefecture that are essentially suburbs of Osaka, the message resonates much less in rural Nara, Wakayama and Shiga. In addition, Hashimoto’s clearly urban, corporate-friendly neo-liberal economic philosophy, while lauded by voters, economists and media in urban centers like Osaka, is seen as a threat in areas of Kansai where topmost worries include caring for the elderly via adequate social services while improving the economy. The social differences between Osaka and the rest of the Kansai region also play a role. Hashimoto’s combative rhetoric, in the manner of a good prosecutor, and his personal attacks and emphasis on “logic” to solve political problems, makes him a fierce debater and fun to watch on TV for a lot of Osakans (and the Osaka television media that, until recently, relied on Hashimoto’s appearances to boost their ratings). But that kind of in-your-face political style, while par for the course in many countries, is welcomed less among many others in Kansai and the rest of Japan, who see not an amusing populist politician but an uncouth bully who is an embarrassment. This is especially true in Kyoto, where Hashimoto is largely seen as an Osaka politician with an Osaka attitude, outlook and philosophy. And that, as anyone in Kyoto and Osaka will tell you, is not a compliment. Among Kyoto’s traditional elites, the Osaka mayor is considered something of a philistine, leading a group of politicians who seem to have all the answers, but really don’t, and who are loyal to nobody but themselves. The final reason it may be more difficult than expected to build a strong, all-Kansai Ishin national party is simply due to long-standing historical rivalries in the region. Despite constant attempts by organizations like the Kansai Economic Federation, Kansai Electric Power Co. and other (usually Osaka-based) organizations with “Kansai” in their name to convince outsiders that regional unity exists, it remains a fluid concept and, depending on the specific issue, a very contentious proposition. The most intense historical rivalry is between the cultural capital of Kyoto and industrial Osaka. “Osaka drinks our toilet water” is an old Kyoto saying, expressing the fact water from Lake Biwa flows through Kyoto down into Osaka Bay. In more recent years, Osaka and Hyogo have often found themselves competing for new economic investment with programs that duplicate each other. And even local Kansai politicians who favor an all-Kansai national political party worry that it will be too Osaka-based, and that, rather than representing the concerns of voters in less-populated areas, it will become, basically, the “Osaka-Kobe Ishin no To.” For now, however, discussions about a new national party are continuing behind the scenes, even as Ishin no To wonders what its fate will be if a new Kansai party arises — especially at next summer’s Upper House election. So Hashimoto may claim to be leaving politics after the November mayoral election. But the recent talk of a new Kansai-based national party indicates that neither Japan, nor the rest of the world, has seen the last of him.",

And after a hot sunny day, it’s time for a cold beer. Whether at a festival, to celebrate an important event, or just to close the day, a glass of Yebisu beer might perfect for the occasion. Although times have changed, Ebisu, the Tokyo district named after the brewery it was home to over a century ago, arguably remains Japan’s brew mecca. The landmark Yebisu Garden Place, built on the site of the former Yebisu brewery, offers a glimpse into the drink’s history and craftsmanship. Yebisu Beer was established in 1890. As shipments increased, the brewery got its own railway freight station in 1901. The current JR Ebisu Station, situated closer to Shibuya Station, opened in 1906 for passenger service. The station’s name derived from the beer and later was adopted for the district. In 1964, Yebisu Beer changed its name to Sapporo Breweries Ltd. Yebisu Garden Place was launched in 1994 on brewery’s former premises. The beer’s TV commercials featured the renowned zither theme tune from the film “The Third Man,” and in 2005 the music was adopted as the departure melody for trains at JR Ebisu Station. The Museum of Yebisu Beer, with a floor space of 1,700 sq. meters, opened at Yebisu Garden Place in 2010, to commemorate the beer’s 120th anniversary. Admission is free, but the museum offers a 40-minute tour for ¥500 for adults, in which a guide explains the beer’s history and suggests ways to drink it. Tastings are offered of two varieties of Yebisu beer. The fee is ¥300 for youngsters, between junior high school age and 19 years old, and includes soft drinks. There is no admission for younger children. For those who want to settle in for a full drinking session, a “tasting salon” offers all kinds of Yebisu beer with snacks, for additional fees. In the tour, guide Natsuko Usune, a “brand communicator,” shows visitors how to pour beer to bring out its taste: 1. Quickly fill the glass half full and wait. 2. Slowly pour to the 90 percent mark and wait again. 3. Add the finishing touch, so that the ratio of froth to beer is 3 to 7. If Ebisu is the neighborhood of beer, nearby Daikanyama is catching up fast with its new landmark, Spring Valley Brewery Tokyo, a beer theme park and restaurant complex established jointly by Kirin Brewery Co. and Spring Valley Brewery Co. It opened on April 17. Visitors can try six varieties of its craft beer while watching various brewing processes. With its newly developed “beer infuser,” various fruit and hop flavors can be added so visitors can blend their own original craft beer.",

    "source": "Signs seen of road widening for futuristic mobility <eos> Japan is about to take a step into the future of personal mobility by easing government regulations so that Segways and similar vehicles can be driven on public thoroughfares. Once the rules ease, which is expected in a week or so, people might see more gyroscope-based devices become part of the daily traffic scene. Let’s take a closer look at personal mobility, the devices involved and what their proliferation will mean for standard commuters. What exactly are personal mobility devices? Generally speaking, these can be any device that improves one’s mobility, particularly in public. The transport ministry says they should be less than 150 cm long, 70 cm high and go no faster than 10 kph. A prime example is the Segway, the two-wheel, self-balancing device made by U.S.-based Segway Inc. that is steered simply by shifting one’s weight. Toyota Motor Corp. followed with the similar Winglet. Both are driven standing upright while holding a hand control. Honda is developing a variation called the Uni-Cub that resembles a stool with wheels, though it is more suited for indoor use. Are they allowed on public thoroughfares? In Japan, they can only be used under tight restrictions, as opposed to many U.S. states and Europe, including Germany and France. Here, the Segway is considered a special motor vehicle that would require mirrors, turn signals and brakes if operated on the street, with drivers requiring licensing. The only places they can be driven right now are in areas that have been designated by the central government as special structural reform zones, at the request of municipalities. But such zones aren’t established simply for allowing Segways and Winglets. They are based on comprehensive plans for energizing the economies of the communities they are in. According to the transport ministry, there are only two areas — Tsukuba in Ibaraki Prefecture and Toyota in Aichi Prefecture — where people can ride Segways and Winglets. Why is the government easing the rules, and where? “In 2011, it became possible to run (personal mobility devices) on public roads in the special reform zones. Various experiments, like Segway tours, have been conducted with no accidents or (traffic) rule violations,” said ministry official Masaru Miyashita. “This means it is possible for areas with similar conditions” to seek permission to test the devices in public, he said. Miyashita added that easing regulations will make it possible for people to ride such devices without being in a special reform zone. Although permission to ride the devices will still be needed from local transport bureaus and police, the new rules will actually allow people, companies and other organizations to request that permission. As for where, Tsukuba has been hosting Segway tours on sidewalks at least 3 meters wide so as not to interfere with pedestrian traffic, and taking security staff along to prevent accidents. Drivers are restricted to a maximum speed of 6 kph and must have a license. The National Police Agency has not announced rules for a nationwide test, but it plans to allow the devices to ply sidewalks less than 3 meters wide simply because that is the reality in many busy urban areas. Will the use of personal mobility devices explode? Dai Akimoto, vice president of Segway Japan Ltd., a Yokohama-based distributor, said city tours using Segways have become increasingly popular in the U.S. and Europe, and Japan might join the trend once deregulation takes place. Cities including Kyoto, Yokohama and Naha in Okinawa, as well as certain parts of Tokyo around the Imperial Palace and the Jingu district, are suitable for Segway use, Akimoto said. There are many people who want to run Segway tours but can’t because of the regulations, so Akimoto said Japan will probably be seeing a good number of Segway-based tour operators flourish in the coming years. Although Segways may not be good for long distances, they are handy for getting around town and might lend themselves to sharing services in the future, like car-sharing, he said. Are they safe? Akimoto said the Segway test in Tsukuba has logged about 20,000 km without incident, demonstrating a certain degree of safety. But similar tests overseas have been much shorter, he said, leaving Japan behind. The Segway also inspired unproven imitations that could pose a risk if they manage to spread in Japan, he warned.",

    "source": "Japan seen seeking U.K. help to best German bid for Aussie sub deal <eos> A Japanese government team is in talks with at least two top British firms to help a Japanese consortium land one of the world’s most lucrative defense contracts, sources in Tokyo said, a $50 billion project to build submarines for Australia. Germany’s ThyssenKrupp (TKMS), a rival bidder, is wooing anxious members of Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s ruling Liberal Party with the economic and political benefits of its proposal. Two Japanese government officials and a company source in Tokyo said Babcock International Group and BAE Systems had approached the consortium of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries with offers of help. Other British defense contractors may also be involved, they said. All three sources spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. Both Babcock and BAE declined to say whether they would work with the consortium, the builders of Japan’s 4,000-ton Soryu diesel-electric submarines, on the Australian project. A spokesman for the Defense Ministry in Tokyo said the Japanese bidders were responding to Australia’s desire to have as much local participation as possible in the project. “With Mitsubishi Heavy taking the lead, we are gathering information from both Japanese and foreign companies in regard to Australian industry but we are unable to disclose any specific names,” the spokesman said. Both Babcock and BAE Systems are well established in Australia. Industry sources in Europe said any decision by Babcock to work with the Japanese bid could unsettle TKMS and France’s state-controlled naval contractor DCNS, which is also in the fray for the submarine contract. Babcock does maintenance work on Australia’s Collins-class submarines, including the torpedo tubes and other parts of its weapons system. BAE Systems, which builds the U.K.’s nuclear submarines, employs 4,500 people in Australia. It’s biggest project there is the construction of Australia’s two new 27,000-ton Canberra-class amphibious assault ships, the largest ships ever to be operated by the Royal Australian Navy. “Japan is arguably ahead of the Germans and French in regard to its technology but lags in terms of doing business in Australia and organizing an industrial package there,” one of the sources in Japan said. Japan may also seek cooperation from Saab by tapping the engineers at the Swedish company who built and still help maintain the Collins-class submarine fleet, the sources said. Saab also declined comment. Parliamentary colleagues of Abbott have told Reuters that the fear of a serious blow-back from failing to choose the winner of the contract wisely is one of the most hotly debated topics within the ruling party. The bidders were well aware of this, they said. According to a company document seen by Reuters, the German bidder TKMS will train local contractors using advanced German manufacturing and production technology and help establish Australia as a naval shipbuilding and repair hub in the Asia-Pacific region. The document is to be shared privately with Australian government ministers as part of the proposal. That is an attractive proposition for a country still reeling from the decision by Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Co. to halt local production in 2016. Two TKMS executives told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that the Australian government would struggle politically to turn down the economic incentives built into their proposal. “There’s an awful lot of politicians across the board … that will not be very politically happy if this (50 billion Australian dollar) life cost sophisticated program goes to solve Japan’s deficit problem,” TKMS Australia Chairman John White told Reuters. Senator Sean Edwards — chairman of the economics committee in the upper house of Australia’s parliament — said that no government could say yes to any proposal that did not offer significant economic benefits for Australia. “I think it’s compelling (to build the submarines in Australia). And I think this is a problem for Japan,” Edwards told Reuters. However, Australia’s Abbot has described Japan as his country’s “closest friend in Asia.” With the United States also keen to spur friendlier ties between its two key allies in Asia, Tokyo has Washington’s backing for made-in-Japan submarines packed with American surveillance, radar and weapons equipment, sources familiar with Washington’s thinking told Reuters earlier. Each of the bidders have been asked to provide three estimates; one for construction overseas, one for a partial assembly in Australia and one for a full build in an Australian shipyard. A recommendation is likely in November.",

    "source": "January-June visitors from abroad rise to record 9.14 million <eos> A record 9.14 million foreigners are estimated to have visited Japan from January to June this year, a 46 percent increase from the same period in 2014, as the country continued to attract tourists from China, Taiwan and elsewhere, government data showed Wednesday. The surge in foreign passenger arrivals, which greatly eclipsed the previous high set last year, came on the back of a weaker yen and government measures such as easing visa rules and expanding the scope of duty-free shopping, according to the Japan Tourism Agency. The figures are the latest sign that the government is moving closer to achieving its goal of increasing the annual figure to 20 million by 2020, when Tokyo will host the Olympics and Paralympics. Shigeto Kubo, commissioner of the agency, told a press conference that he expects around 18 million foreign passenger arrivals this year, up from about 13.41 million last year. In June alone, the number of foreign passenger arrivals jumped 52 percent from a year earlier to 1.60 million, said the Japan National Tourism Organization, a body overseen by the agency. By countries and regions, Chinese traveler arrivals more than doubled to 462,300, the largest share of the total and a record for a single month, followed by 345,200 from Taiwan. South Korean travelers were third at 251,500, hitting an all-time high for June. But a year-on-year increase sharply slowed amid the recent MERS virus outbreak in South Korea that has made people reluctant to leave their homes. The organization expects a lot more visits in July, the start of the summer vacation season. More than 40 cruise ships from East Asia are set to make port calls in Japan, it said. For the first half of the year, the number of Chinese travelers more than doubled from a year earlier to 2.18 million, followed by 1.82 million from South Korea and 1.79 million from Taiwan. The government has been stepping up efforts to attract foreign visitors to prop up the economy amid Japan’s shrinking population. In October, the government abolished a rule limiting duty-free products to electrical appliances and fashion goods, and allowed everything from cosmetics to food and alcohol to be eligible for exemption from the nation’s 8 percent consumption tax. Such measures appear to have further encouraged shopping by tourists. Chinese on shopping sprees dubbed “explosive buying” have become a familiar sight in areas such as Tokyo’s Ginza shopping district. Despite concerns over China’s economic slowdown, the tourism agency’s Kubo said he currently does not see any negative impact on organized tours to Japan. Between January and June last year, the overall number of foreign passenger arrivals stood at 6.26 million, a record at the time.",

    "source": "People spending more time surfing the Web, less time watching TV <eos> The TV has long been the dominant media source in Japan, but people here, especially younger ones, are now apparently opting to spend more time online instead, according to a recent survey by NHK. The latest survey on people’s attitudes toward TV, which is conducted every five years by NHK Broadcasting Culture Research Institute, says the number of people who watch TV for 30 minutes to two hours daily or “short-time viewers” increased. “Long-time viewers” — those who watch for four hours or more a day — decreased for the first time since the poll began in 1985. Respondents were asked how many hours they watch TV daily. Viewing on public holidays and watching DVDs was excluded. The survey, released last week, says that the number of short-time viewers was 35 percent in 2010 but that increased to 38 percent this year. The ration for those who don’t watch TV at all also grew to 6 percent from 4 percent. The number of long-time viewers was at 37 percent, down from 40 percent five years ago. By age, people in their 20s to 50s are watching less TV, while those in their 60s and 70s are spending more time watching their favorite programs. The decline in TV viewing is apparently connected to the Internet, as younger people like to watch videos that way. Still, the poll shows that more than 80 percent of people in all age groups think having a TV is necessary. NHK surveyed 3,600 people across the country who were 16 years old or older in February and March, and received valid answers from 2,442 of them.",

    "source": "America still rules the world of Japan's theme parks <eos> On July 15, Universal Studios Japan celebrated the first anniversary of its Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey attraction, which lets visitors “experience” flying with the famous boy wizard using 4K-resolution 3-D imagery. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the theme park’s management expected the new ride to increase attendance by 2 million over the subsequent year, but actually, admissions between July 2014 and June 2015 were up by more than 3 million. The number of visitors to the Osaka park in June was 28 percent higher than it was a year earlier. In the past year, 13.5 million people bought tickets to USJ. As impressive as this number is, it hardly compares to last year’s attendance for Tokyo Disney Resort, which incorporates the Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea theme parks. TDR logged 31.3 million visitors in 2014, an increase of 0.3 percent over the previous year and the third year in a row it has set a new record for attendance. It’s almost certain that 2015’s numbers will set another record since a new attraction based on last year’s hit Disney animation feature, “Frozen,” opened at Tokyo Disneyland in January for a limited time. These two establishments together account for more than half the theme-park admissions in Japan, which would seem to reinforce the notion that Japanese people love American culture, even though USJ, which long ago abandoned its reliance on attractions exclusive to Universal Studios, features a ride based on the popular Japanese anime “Yokai Watch.” The overwhelming popularity of the two parks compared to Japanese equivalents also has something to do with their business models and the way they’ve exploited their appeal to certain demographics. In essence, they don’t really have any competition. The No. 3 theme park in Japan (not counting the Kariya Highway Oasis service area outside Nagoya, which, because it has a ferris wheel, sometimes shows up on these lists), with 5 million admissions last year, was Nagashima Spa Land in Mie Prefecture, which is more of a big hot-spring resort with an amusement park attached than a standalone theme park. Tokyo Disneyland has 39 distinct rides, and Tokyo DisneySea 26. The price of a daily passport for either is ¥6,900 for an adult (less if you enter the park later in the day), and ¥6,000 and ¥4,500 for teens and children, respectively, which is reasonable when you compare it to the price of a passport at one of the Disney-related parks in the U.S. There the one-day ticket price starts at $99 (¥12,300) for anyone over the age of 9. Taking the whole family to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, or the Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida, is very expensive, but for Americans, going to Disneyland is more or less a once-in-a-lifetime thing. In Japan, theme park success is built as much on repeaters and couples as it is on families, which is why Tokyo Disney Resort also offers a yearly pass for either of its parks for ¥59,000. A combination pass for both parks is ¥86,000. The use of these passes is limited during certain times of the year. USJ started out strong when it opened in 2001 but struggled after that for a number of years as it went through a series of safety-related scandals. The key to its success was that it started adding new attractions regularly after Goldman Sachs invested heavily in the park, and USJ kept its prices affordable enough that whole families, including grandpa and grandma, could go more than once a year. Much has been made of the fact that USJ has raised its prices twice in the last year — it’s now ¥7,200 for an adult — but the increases did not stunt admissions at all. USJ also has yearly passes: ¥19,800 for a limited pass, and ¥28,800 for an unlimited VIP pass. And while USJ’s fortunes were built on local repeaters, it has also seen admissions of people from outside the Kansai area increase steadily over the years, including visitors from overseas, mainly Asia. In the last year, the number of foreign visitors increased by 60 percent. That’s why local management at both theme parks are slightly nervous: Universal Studios will open a new park in Beijing by 2019 and Disney is doing the same in Shanghai. USJ will compete aggressively by launching more new rides in the near future, as well as opening a new hotel, the Park Front, on Aug. 1, whose theme is “Trip ot the USA,” featuring decor that is meant to remind guests of Las Vegas or New York or some other iconic American city. For its part, Oriental Land, the Japanese company that operates TDR, plans to spend ¥5 billion on improvements aimed at attracting more Asian tourists. If competing with other outlets of the same brand sounds counterproductive, it’s no skin off the back of Disney Enterprises. The company takes 7 percent of all revenues at TDR as royalties. USJ is not a listed company, so what portion they pay to Universal Studios is not public record, but it’s probably about the same. In other words, once they license the brand to local endeavors, Disney and Universal practically print money, which is why the U.S. is so keen on pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with its emphasis on licensing and intellectual property rights. American culture still travels well in this part of the world. It just has to adapt.",

The woman slipped into the patrol car on Wednesday and drove off while a state trooper was engaged with a passing motorist on an unrelated topic, a trooper dispatch report said. Authorities found the car not far from where it was stolen in Big Lake, a lakeside community of 3,500 people about 65 miles (100 km) northwest of Anchorage. The following day, troopers arrested Amber Watford, 28, and Joshua Watford 38, in a home in Wasilla, about 45 miles (72 km) north of Anchorage. Joshua Watford was first arrested in Big Lake on Wednesday for failure to appear at court-ordered, alcohol-related classes from a previous driving under the influence charge, State Trooper spokeswoman Megan Peters said. Not long after his arrest, Watford’s wife made off with the patrol car, and the couple remained at large for about 30 hours, the trooper report said.

    "source": "Gang split may end with a whimper, not a bang <eos> A detective who specialized in organized crime once told me a dark joke: What type of crime occurs when a member of the yakuza kills another gangster? Answer: destruction of property. The joke perhaps reflects an unwritten premise of law enforcement in Japan: as long as gangs confine their conflict to other gangs, it’s no big deal. However, when the Yamaguchi-gumi — the country’s largest organized crime syndicate, with about 23,400 known members at the end of 2014 if quasi-members are included — split into two factions on Aug. 27, the police were understandably concerned. Would a bloody gang war break out? According to a report by the National Police Agency, when the Yamaguchi-gumi last broke up in 1984, a violent battle erupted that claimed the lives of at least 25 people and resulted in more than 70 injuries. The warfare took place on an epic scale: gun battles erupted on the street, assassinations were carried out and trucks were driven into the houses of rival members. In 1985, Yamaguchi-gumi members were arrested in Hawaii on suspicion of attempting to purchase 100 handguns, five machine-guns and at least one rocket launcher — ostensibly to knock off their rivals. Seventy-three-year-old Yamaguchi-gumi leader Kenichi Shinoda, who is also known as Shinobu Tsukasa, began his criminal career in the Kodo-kai group, which is based in Nagoya. According to the Asahi Shimbun, Shinoda had indicated he wanted to move Yamaguchi-gumi headquarters from Kobe to Nagoya. The Yamaken-gumi, which is based in Kobe, opposed Shinoda’s plan, and 13 affiliate gang leaders in Kansai failed to attend a meeting on Aug. 27, the Asahi Shimbun said. As a result, the affiliated gang leaders who skipped the meeting were expelled Tuesday. The rift appears to be partly historical. In July 1989, Yoshinori Watanabe, who was head of the Yamaken-gumi syndicate, became the supreme leader of the Yamaguchi-gumi group at a ceremony in Kobe. Shinoda inherited the position in 2005 and is believed to have promoted members of his Kodo-kai syndicate to top positions in the Yamaguchi-gumi. The Yamaken-gumi syndicate watched its power dwindle with discontent, and the Kodo-kai syndicate’s loyal treatment of kowtowing factions is believed to be another reason for the split, according to NHK. A mid-level Yamaguchi-gumi member, who refused to be named, told this reporter that the Kodo-kai syndicate had also been singled out because of its belligerence to the police, which had led to tightening laws that restricted the group’s activities. Indeed, the National Police Agency cracked down on the Kodo-kai syndicate in September 2009. The United States, which had sanctioned the Yamaguchi-gumi and its executives in 2012 and 2013, blacklisted the Kodo-kai and its current leader in April this year. Law enforcement agencies in Japan and the U.S. are unlikely to be too unhappy at news of the split. While the National Police Agency warned the break-up could erupt in a bloody war, some are expecting the split may end not with a bang but with a whimper . Atsushi Mizoguchi, Japan’s leading expert on the Yamaguchi-gumi group, told NHK he expected the odd skirmish between syndicates but ruled out a massive war. Gang wars aren’t what they used to be, Mizoguchi says. For one thing, they’re expensive and a syndicate’s usual activities — extortion, blackmail, bid-rigging, etc. — is quickly disrupted. These days, leaders of organized crime syndicates fear of being held accountable for their employees’ activities. In November 2004, the Supreme Court ruled that organized crime syndicates were essentially corporations and, as such, their leaders were liable for any damages that occur as a result of one of their member’s actions. A Yamaguchi-gumi leader was ordered to pay ¥80 million to the family of a police officer who was killed in a gang war. Tadamasa Goto, who led the last unsuccessful rebellion in the Yamaguchi-gumi in 2008 after he was expelled from the group, is perhaps a classic example of why gang leaders prefer not to engage in violent conflict. According to the Asahi Shimbun, several of Goto’s men were convicted for the murder of a real-estate agent. The real-estate agent was killed in 2006 for blocking the sale of a building worth $20 million that Goto’s gang wanted to control and sell at a steep profit. Goto himself was never criminally prosecuted. The family of the deceased, seeking justice in civil court, sued Goto and Shinoda for damages in 2012. Shinoda, who was locked up in solitary confinement in 2006, certainly couldn’t have ordered or condoned the hit. Reaching an out-of-court settlement, Goto apologized to the family of the victim, paid them $1.2 million and then fled to Cambodia. Crime, as the old adage goes, always pays, but sometimes it seems gangsters have to pay a little back for their crimes. At the time, however, it was a valuable lesson: Killing people can cost a lot of money. Organized crime syndicates in modern times are less concerned with honor or loyalty. For them, it all boils down to the bottom-line: money. Warfare brings down heat. If a civilian is killed, the police enact new laws and business dries up. For organized crime syndicates, the worst-case scenario in the wake of the split is that the Diet finally passes a criminal conspiracy law that would allow police officers to make arrests all the way up the food chain, close down gang headquarters and arrest syndicate leaders for all crimes committed by their subordinates, including murder. Nobody wants that, right? There will be no winner in such a war — except, perhaps, the police. The National Police Agency can claim success in reducing the power of the Yamaguchi-gumi group and weakening the Kodo-kai syndicate. If the war isn’t particularly bloody and the involved parties only kill each other, then business will continue as usual. Everyone in the underworld understands that one thing holds true in modern times: Crime does pay, gang wars almost certainly do not.",

The company, which had long been in straitened financial circumstances, is now able to declare a dividend of 12 percent on new shares and 7 percent on old shares for the first half-year term just closed. The withdrawal of the British and German steamers from the Oriental service consequent upon the war and the subsequent discontinuance of the Oriental line of the Pacific Mail Steamship Co. account for the sudden turn for the better. With no rival foreign steamship concern extant, the Toyo Kisen Kaisha has come practically to monopolize the San Francisco line. Mr. Shiraishi, managing director of the company, says the company was able to redeem ¥1.4 million of an ¥8.7 million loan made at the end of the last term, and supposing the favorable business conditions are to continue for some three years or so, the company will be able to clear all of its liabilities, which now stand at ¥7.3 million. 75 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Sept. 24, 1940 Accord reached with French Indo-China Japanese forces entered French Indo-China early today, in accordance with an agreement between the Japanese and French (Vichy) authorities. Although the place of entry was not disclosed, it was presumed to be from Kwangsi Province. Announcement of the agreement came from an Army, Navy joint communique from the Imperial Headquarters and the Foreign Office. It stated: 1. That the Japanese and French governments have concluded an agreement of military importance. 2. That, despite the agreement, a skirmish occurred when the forces entered presumably because of a misunderstanding on the part of the local French Indo-Chinese troops. Although no details of the agreement have been revealed, it is understood the French authorities, as a result of negotiations conducted both here and at Hanoi since some time last month, are to offer facilities for Japanese military operations in Indo-China. 50 YEARS AGO Friday, Sept. 21, 1965 (Supplement published on the occasion of the ninth IAEA Conference, held in Tokyo) Tepco reveals atomic power generation plans The sources of energy used for the generation of electric power in Japan have been progressively switched from hydraulic power to coal and then to heavy oil. The country is now preparing to develop nuclear energy as a new source of energy from the standpoint of economically securing fuel required for steam power generation. The demand made on Tepco is expected to reach 17.89 million kw by 1973. Tepco’s program for nuclear power generation calls for the development of about 2 million kw by 1975. The move is expected to result in the conservation of about 3 million kiloliters of heavy oil, or about one-fifth of the total amount of crude oil needs. Tepco has constantly kept busy making preparations, doing research and conducting other studies since setting up an atomic energy generation section in 1955. A land area of about 2 million sq. meters was acquired for this purpose in November of last year along the coast stretching from Okuma-machi to Futaba-machi of Futaba-gun, Fukushima Prefecture. Plans have been made to install the first and second reactors at this point. The enriched uranium light water model is scheduled to be used as the first reactor. The Fukushima Research Center was established last December for the purpose of conducting on-the-spot research. In order to collect enough data needed for ensuring the safety of the atomic power plant and its construction, the center is now busy at work on meteorological observation, geological and oceanographic surveys along with seismographic and subterranean observations — all of which are broad and time-consuming projects. A study is underway to determine the water pumping formula for the cooling system, but a tentative plan calls for the acquisition of water directly from the sea through the construction of breakwaters. A new committee, an advisory organ to the president is headed by Naojiro Tanaka, an executive director. It is in charge of drawing up blueprints for the atomic power plants and for making other arrangements necessary for launching the construction. Another committee was organized this past July, also under the chairmanship of Tanaka, to work on the problem of earthquake-proofing and other technical matters regarding the construction. This committee is made up of academic and engineering experts, both inside and outside the company. Thus busily engaged, Tepco is moving steadily ahead toward its goal. 25 YEARS AGO Saturday, Sept. 15, 1990 Tokyo civil servants to get reusable chopsticks The Tokyo Metropolitan Government will adopt a policy of using plastic chopsticks instead of wooden ones at restaurants inside its new office building in Shinjuku next March, when the high-rise opens.

    "source": "Nearly 70% of Japan Inc. unready to safeguard nation's new ID numbers <eos> Most of the nation’s companies are struggling to find a way to securely store My Number — the new 12-digit social security key that will be used to access everyone’s income tax and bank account information starting next year. The search for security is making life especially difficult for small and midsize firms, which account for about 99 percent of all companies in Japan. “It’s a great burden on us,” said Masanori Okamura of ICT-Leasing, Inc., a Tokyo aviation firm with 15 employees. “We are collecting information about how to accommodate the My Number system, like how to store data safely,” said Okamura, who started studying it late last month. According to a survey by the nonprofit Japan Institute for Promotion of Digital Economy and Community, nearly 70 percent of the 3,386 firms who responded to the March to May survey had not begun preparing for My Number’s debut. This was especially true at small and midsize firms outside Tokyo. Proponents of My Number hope the system will speed up Japan’s notoriously slow administrative customs with a comprehensive, streamlined ID system. But most companies say it will only generate more work. My Number “will not benefit most companies” in light of the time and energy needed to prepare for it, said Masami Komatsu, a senior manager in the ID Business Promotion Division of computer maker NEC Corp., which is holding seminars to teach companies about My Number. State guidelines stipulate that all employers must designate a special area for handling the sensitive ID numbers and restrict access to it. They also must eliminate any data related to them completely after a certain period of time once it becomes unnecessary, and maintain an access log to record who accessed which employee’s information, when, and for what purpose. If personal data containing the ID numbers is leaked, the leaker will face up to four years in prison or a ¥2 million fine — about twice the penalty for leaks of other personal information. Given this burden, it will be easier for companies to store the ID numbers digitally, rather than on paper, Komatsu said. “What’s not good about paper is anyone can instantly take a photo with their smartphone and share it online, without even leaving a record,” Komatsu said. “But if stored electronically, access to personal information can be restricted and recorded in a log automatically so it’s easier to detect and prevent unauthorized access.” But storing data electronically may put personal information at risk of being stolen by hackers. In June, the hacking of the Japan Pension Service resulted in the public release of 1.25 million people’s pension data. While this caused a delay in Diet deliberations on the new ID system, the My Number bills cleared the Diet in early September anyway. In addition to installing a security system, companies will need to raise employee awareness and hammer out new regulations to ensure the data won’t get into the hands of strangers, Komatsu said. “My Number isn’t just something that involves only a certain department within a company. It’s something that involves the entire company” he said.",

    "source": "Will bureaucrats stymie Kyoto's bid to lure central government bodies out of Tokyo? <eos> KYOTO - Every decade or so, it seems talk arises in Japan about relocating the functions of the central government outside the capital. The reasons given are economic (it’s cheaper outside Tokyo and hosting a government agency will improve the local economy), cultural (Japan is too Tokyo-centric and relocations will revitalize local culture), and logistical (given all the earthquakes and constant warnings about the ‘Big One’ in Tokyo, doesn’t it make sense to decentralize before it’s too late?). The result has usually been a brief period of intense discussion, often accompanied by architectural plans for a gleaming new Diet building or ministry headquarters in the middle of some prefecture you’ve never heard of, followed by platitude-laden speeches from politicians about the need to get the bureaucrats out of Tokyo. The discussion then ends in silence, as bureaucratic opposition and political indifference lead to inertia. But with Kyoto’s current attempts to lure the Cultural Affairs Agency and seven other public organs to the area, this time might be different. Last month, prefectural and city officials from Kyoto, as well as the Kyoto Chamber of Commerce and Industry, all backed a formal, detailed proposal that would see Japan’s ancient capital host the modern government organs that manage Japan’s cultural heritage. The proposal’s centerpiece is the agency, which would move from Tokyo to Kyoto. Other Tokyo-based bodies it is interested in hosting include the National Institutes for Cultural Heritage, the National Museum of Art, the Japan Arts Council and the Japan National Tourism Organization. In addition, Kyoto Prefecture is proposing that parts of three scientific research institutes, including the National Institute for Radiological Sciences (based in Chiba), the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (Tokyo), and Riken (Saitama), be relocated to the Kansai Science City area in the southern part of the prefecture. “If the Cultural Affairs Agency is relocated to Kyoto, it can create a new relationship between history and culture,” Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Sadakazu Tanigaki, who represents a district in Kyoto Prefecture, told local media earlier this month. Kyoto’s efforts to lure the agency are long-standing but part of a larger, more recent effort by Tokyo to revitalize rural economies by relocating these bodies to other prefectures. On Sept. 1, regional revitalization minister Shigeru Ishiba, viewed as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s strongest interparty rival, announced 42 of the 47 prefectures had submitted proposals to host 69 such organs. A panel will be set up to examine the plans, with a final decision expected by April. Despite political backing from both Tanigaki and Ishiba on the Cultural Affairs Agency’s shift to Kyoto, bureaucratic opposition remains. Many in the Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry, which oversees the agency, fear the move will cause communication problems with lawmakers and other ministries. In Kyoto’s plan, it’s assumed agency bureaucrats will need to make about 20 annual trips to Tokyo to give Diet testimony. As the land being offered is next to Kyoto Station and Tokyo is only about two hours away, the prefecture says, any inconvenience is limited. “Bureaucrats will offer 2,000 reasons why relocation is not possible. The government needs to demonstrate whether or not it’s really serious,” Kyoto Gov. Keiji Yamada, who heads the national governors’ association, told the group at a recent meeting. Will Kyoto or any of the other prefectures seeking to host central government bodies succeed? Or will Tokyo’s bureaucrats again defeat the latest effort to oust them? Kyoto’s plans for the cultural agency are more advanced and have more prominent support than many of the other plans submitted. But paralysis by analysis is a sport Tokyo bureaucrats are particularly adept at, and it would not be a surprise if, come next spring, it’s announced that “further study” is needed on moving central government functions outside Tokyo.",

    "source": "For Hashimoto, much at stake in name of new national party <eos> OSAKA - What’s in a name? If you’re Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto and trying to form a new national party that will represent the region but could also become a powerful political player on issues of interest to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, pretty much everything. On Oct. 1, Ishin no To (Japan Innovation Party) co-founders Hashimoto and Osaka Gov. Ichiro Matsui, along with some 20 to 25 of the party’s Diet members, are expected to launch a new national party. The move effectively splits Ishin, with 51 members at present, between the Osaka faction loyal to Hashimoto and Matsui, and the faction led by Lower House lawmaker Yorihisa Matsuno. Who will join Hashimoto, stick with Matsuno, or leave for another party has been the subject of intense speculation in and out of Osaka in the past few weeks. At the moment, roughly two dozen Diet members have signaled they will follow Hashimoto. Another 22 originally joined Ishin as allies of Matsuno, a former member of the Democratic Party of Japan, while another 10 had joined as followers Kenji Eda, who led the small party Yui no To. But the real question is what will happen to the dozen or so other members who don’t have strong loyalties to either faction. Their final decision is likely to rest not on the policies Hashimoto’s new party espouses, but on what it names itself. The clear front-runner and most likely choice is “Osaka Ishin no To,” with Osaka spelled in hiragana. “I’m partial to ‘Osaka Ishin no To.’ We’re going to use ‘Osaka’ as a word symbolic of changing politics from the local level,” Hashimoto told supporters at an event earlier this month. The only problem with that plan is that many other Ishin Diet members, as well as local politicians and political groups around Kansai allied with Hashimoto, do not want to see another new party called Osaka Ishin. Instead, they are hoping for a name that will reflect the region in a broader sense. Ishin no To Diet members from other Kansai cities recently met in Osaka to express those concerns to Hashimoto, but he remained firm in his choice. At present, Osaka Ishin no Kai (One Osaka) is the name of Hashimoto’s local party. “If they don’t like the name ‘Osaka,’ they don’t have to join the new party,” Hashimoto said. But Ishin Diet members not in “Hashimoto’s Dozen,” the nearly 12 lawmakers from Osaka, aren’t the only politicians concerned with names. Over the past few years, Abe and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga have strengthened their ties with Hashimoto and Matsui, who belonged to Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party before linking up with Hashimoto. Any new national party led by Hashimoto and Matsui will find itself being courted by Abe on issues ranging from educational reform to constitutional revision. This is especially likely if Komeito, the LDP’s junior coalition partner, takes big losses in next July’s Upper House election due to lingering resentment from its support base — Soka Gakkai, Japan’s biggest lay Buddhist group — over the security legislation the ruling bloc rammed through the Diet earlier this month. “Abe understands how important promoting the integration of Osaka is to Hashimoto, but there are also concerns about whether an ‘Osaka Ishin no To’ would end up with enough winners in the Upper House election to make it a useful party to the LDP,” said one Hashimoto adviser who asked not to be named. Even if “Osaka Ishin no To” is not the final choice, it’s clear the new party will not be called anything that sounds infantile, unnatural or silly when translated, or anything that makes headline writers at English-language news outlets groan or grin. Hashimoto is not the type to sign off on a name like Smile Party, People’s Lives First Party or Rise Up, Japan! Yet the name could also turn into unwanted baggage if Osaka Ishin-backed candidates lose in a Nov. 22 double election for the Osaka governor and mayor. Such a loss would make an “Osaka Ishin no To” or even a “Kansai Ishin no To” a poor tool for recruiting candidates for the Upper House election. “If we are defeated in either election (by a candidate from one of the established parties), we won’t be able to make a plan for integrating Osaka,” Matsui told reporters a couple of weeks ago. That, in turn, would raise serious questions about whether either Hashimoto or Matsui could draw enough followers to a new party that states its primary goal at the national level is to integrate a city where political power is now in the hands of an anti-Hashimoto, anti-Osaka Ishin mayor. As for a potential “Kansai Ishin no To,” even something like that could now have trouble drawing ambitious politicians who share Hashimoto’s goals for the region. In a clear bid to win back regional voters who gravitated toward Hashimoto because of his efforts to revive the local economy, Toshihiro Nikai, the LDP’s powerful general council chairman, recently unveiled plans to form a “Kinki Mega Region.” Nikai’s plan centers around bringing about two rail projects near and dear to Kansai business leaders and bigwigs: extension of the magnetically levitated shinkansen line (now under construction) from Nagoya to Osaka, and of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Line to Osaka via Kyoto or another route. As a former transport and economy and trade minister, a Diet veteran like Nikai has the connections and experience needed to make such projects happen. Hashimoto dismissed Nikai’s plan as a purely political ploy, saying that what’s been announced so far is vague enough to fit on a sheet of paper. But if Abe is no longer prime minister during the Upper House poll, Hashimoto, even if he runs and wins, could find that voters elsewhere in Kansai prefer an LDP candidate over one of his own because they think Nikai’s plan is more politically realistic than Hashimoto’s, regardless of what his new party’s manifesto might promise — or what its name turns out to be.",

    "source": "Dating apps fire back at billboards linking them STD spread <eos> LOS ANGELES - An AIDS health care group is defending an ad campaign in Los Angeles that links popular dating apps with the spread of sexual transmitted diseases. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation targets Tinder, a location-based dating app, and Grindr, a similar site for gay men, in billboards and bus benches that are aimed at reminding users about the risks of casual sex and offering free STD tests. “In many ways, location-based mobile dating apps are becoming a digital bathhouse for millennials wherein the next sexual encounter can literally just be a few feet away — as well as the next STD,” Whitney Engeran-Cordova, senior public health director for the foundation, said in a statement. Billboards show a silhouette of a man labeled “Tinder” face-to-face with a woman’s silhouette labeled “chlamydia.” A silhouette of a man labeled “Grindr” faces a male silhouette labeled “gonorrhea.” Reaction from the dating apps was swift. Within two hours of the first billboard going up, Grindr pulled commercials that the foundation pays for on the dating site to promote free STD testing, the foundation said. In less than 24 hours, Tinder sent a cease and desist letter claiming the campaign falsely associates the dating app with the spread of venereal diseases. “These unprovoked and wholly unsubstantiated accusations are made to irreparably damage Tinder’s reputation in an attempt to encourage others to take an HIV test offered by your organization,” a lawyer for Tinder wrote. The foundation sent a letter to Tinder denying that it disparaged the company and saying it would not remove the reference to the app. The campaign is intended to draw attention to rising STD rates that the foundation said coincides with the popularity of the sites that make hook-ups easier, said Michael Weinstein, the foundation’s president. “It’s logical, if you can be hooked up with someone in an urban area within minutes,” he said, “of course you’re going to have more STDs.” Email messages sent to Tinder and Grindr for comment were not immediately returned. The signs are currently on a dozen billboards in Los Angeles and 45 bus benches, Weinstein said. The Los Angeles-based foundation, which provides health care to HIV and AIDS patients and free sexual disease testing, plans to also put them up in New York City, Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Florida.",

    "source": "U.S.-Japan environmental agreement on U.S. bases flawed, experts say <eos> A newly signed agreement between Tokyo and Washington allowing Japanese officials access to U.S. military bases in Japan to conduct environmental surveys has flaws, experts said, questioning its effectiveness due to vague wording in the bilateral documents. The accord, signed between Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Monday in Washington, supplements the existing Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement governing the use of U.S. bases in Japan. Hiromori Maedomari, a professor at Okinawa International University who has authored a number of books on the SOFA, said Tuesday the accord was only half a step forward. Maedomari noted the wording in the accord did not guarantee Japanese officials access to U.S. military facilities to conduct surveys in case of environmental incidents. A document stipulating procedures for access to the U.S. military bases says the Japanese government or local municipalities “may request” permission from the U.S. side to conduct surveys. The document goes on to say the U.S. will “give all due consideration to the request” and “respond as promptly as practicable.” It adds the Japanese side “may also request to take samples” in relation to on-the-spot surveys. “If the U.S. did not accept the request, it would be impossible for the Japanese side to carry out the survey,” Maedomari said. “It’s totally up to the U.S. side whether the request would be accepted,” which would make the situation no different to before the new agreement. Maedomari, a former chief editorial writer for the Ryukyu Shimpo newspaper in Okinawa, said there were cases in Okinawa where it took a long time for local municipalities to be allowed to enter the U.S. military facilities for surveys when accidents occurred. In a 2013 U.S. military helicopter crash near a dam in Camp Hansen in Ginoza, local officials, who suspected environmental contamination, received samples half a year later and entered the area one year after they submitted their requests. Masami Kawamura, director of Citizens’ Network for Biodiversity in Okinawa, has been leading efforts to ensure Tokyo and Washington are more transparent about the environmental impact of U.S. bases on Okinawa Island. “The new pact has been described as a way to reduce Okinawa’s military burden but it will do nothing to solve environmental problems. The wording is vague and it still gives the U.S. strong discretionary powers. USFJ (U.S. Forces Japan) and Tokyo ought to prioritize the rights of the people affected by contamination,” she said. Professor Maedomari said the pact wouldn’t contribute to reducing the base-hosting burden unless it was actually proven to work. “Unfortunately, empty promises won’t lead to easing those burdens,” he said. To give teeth to the agreement, Maedomari stressed that provisions placing obligation on the U.S. were necessary. “Without provisions requiring the U.S. side to comply with the request promptly, the pact won’t have effectiveness,” Maedomari said. He also suggested establishing a punitive clause for the U.S. side in the event that it caused a serious environmental spill. It is important for Japan to establish measures now to prevent environmental issues, Maedomari said. The Japanese government should demand that the U.S. “disclose information or report in advance regarding the use of military facilities and its assets that could pose a danger to the environment,” he noted, adding that such a clause was lacking in the agreement. Regarding the timing of environmental surveys for land expected to be returned to Japan, which was stipulated as “no more than 150 working days prior to the return date,” Maedomari said such surveys should be carried out immediately after Tokyo and Washington agreed on a return. As it stood, the time frame was too short for the local government to address the environmental issues and to come up with plans for its use, Maedomari said.

    "source": "Japan, U.S. sign new environment pact allowing municipal checks at U.S. military bases <eos> WASHINGTON - Japan and the United States on Monday signed a new pact allowing local officials to enter U.S. military bases in Japan to conduct environmental surveys. Under the accord, the U.S. can also give permission for Japan to conduct soil and other relevant surveys about seven months prior to the expected return to Japanese control of land used for U.S. bases. The agreement was signed between Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter when they met Monday during Kishida’s five-day trip to the U.S. that started in Washington. It is the first time a pact of this kind, which supplements the existing Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement governing the use of U.S. bases in Japan, has been drawn up, a senior Foreign Ministry official said. The agreement came into effect immediately. Kishida said at the signing ceremony that the environmental pact “has great significance and will enhance local communities’ trust” in the management of U.S. military bases in Japan. “We are mindful about being good neighbors, which includes realigning our bases and being aware of any concerns that local communities might have about our operations,” Carter said. The agreement “represents a big step forward in our alliance,” he added. The preexisting SOFA had no clause allowing municipalities to conduct environmental surveys on the bases, thereby requiring prefectural and municipal officials to obtain U.S. permission to enter facilities. The new deal, which covers all municipalities hosting U.S. bases in Japan, is part of what the central government sees as measures to ease the base-hosting burden of these municipalities, particularly in Okinawa Prefecture. The government is hoping that taking such a step will help move forward a controversial plan, being pushed by the central government and U.S., for the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to relocate within Okinawa, Japanese officials said. The relocation plan remains a source of tension between the central and local governments, with local authorities and communities in Okinawa demanding that the base be moved outside of the southern island prefecture, which hosts the bulk of U.S. military forces in Japan. Okinawa and other base-hosting prefectures have long been asking for such environmental surveys, fearing possible pollution and requesting that surveys be carried out long before land is returned so that they can plan ahead for how to use it, the officials said. But whether the new accord will satisfy Okinawa and other communities hosting U.S. bases remains to be seen amid their demands that environmental surveys be carried out three years before the return of land. Last October, Japan and the U.S. reached a “substantial agreement” on the pact but details as to the extent to which Japan would be ensured the right of access to U.S. facilities were not decided. The new agreement addresses the establishment and maintenance of procedures for Japanese authorities to have appropriate access to U.S. facilities and areas in two cases. One is when an environmental or spill incident occurs within a base, while the other is when field surveys, including cultural asset surveys, are needed for land expected to be returned to Japanese control. When an incident occurs, Japan can request on-site inspections and ask for samples of soil and water believed to be contaminated. The U.S. will then promptly respond to the request under the deal. The new pact also says the Japanese and U.S. governments will share available and appropriate information, and that the U.S. will continue to abide by the Japan Environmental Governing Standards. Conducting environmental surveys for land expected to be returned can also be done earlier than the time frame of 150 days, should Tokyo and Washington reach a separate agreement, the ministry official said. Japan and the U.S. decided to drop a section under which Japan would pay for the costs of environmental protection projects, as agreed last October, the official said.",

    "source": "Home-sharing services on the rise in Japan as owners cash in on tourist boom <eos> For foreign tourists to Japan, staying at traditional ryokan inns is a popular way to enjoy their trips, but home-sharing services are growing as an alternative form of accommodation. Legally speaking, some home-sharing services fall in a gray zone because existing accommodation rules were drafted before such services began on the Internet. Following are questions and answers about home-sharing services in Japan. What has prompted the rise in home-sharing services in Japan? The rising popularity can be traced to the fast-growing U.S.-based agency Airbnb Inc., which mediates between “hosts” offering to share their homes and “guests” seeking to stay in them. Founded in 2008, Airbnb provides its services from its website, which has about 50 million users and lists 1.5 million homes in more than 190 countries. In Japan, 16,000 homes — a threefold increase on last year — are registered with the service, the firm said, while the number of foreign tourists who used the service in Japan shot up fivefold in the same period. Tokyo-based venture minma Inc. launched a similar site called Roomstay in April, while another, Tomarina, is run by Tokyo-based Tomareru Inc. The growing demand for home-sharing may be attributable to the rapid increase in inbound tourists, as many users who book stays via Airbnb are foreign travelers, according to the company. In 2013, the number of foreign tourists exceeded 10 million for the first time and is still growing. The country is expected to see about 19 million visitors this year. What advantages are there in home-sharing? By staying at local homes, “travelers can enjoy real local experiences as if they were living there,” instead of the perspective travelers have when staying in hotels, Airbnb said in an email. Hosts can benefit by offering vacant rooms for profit. Airbnb’s global research shows that 70 percent of homes registered on its site are located outside hotel-concentrated areas. Thus the economic effects of tourism can be distributed over wider regions, the company said. How does home-sharing fall in a legal gray area? The Inns and Hotels Act states that those who accommodate guests for a fee on a regular basis must obtain permission from their local government. Those violating the law can face a maximum ¥30,000 fine or up to six months in prison. In fact, a British male who failed to receive such permission was reportedly arrested in May for earning profits from people who stayed at his home. Media reports said authorities had warned him many times. In that sense, people who register their homes to matching websites, including Airbnb, could be operating such services illegally if they don’t have permission from authorities. Airbnb said it asks people who seek to become hosts to follow local regulations. Asked if the firm checks to ascertain if its listed hosts have legal permission to operate, Airbnb would only say it asks them to follow the rules. Meanwhile, Hideyoshi Koyanagi, a spokesperson at Tomareru, said Tomarina made sure that hosts had permission. Tomarina has about 500 listed homes, mainly in country areas and catering mostly to Japanese customers, he said. Koyanagi added that the current situation was unfair, as some other service operators seemed to not apply the same diligence. He said the government should publicly announce whether or not it intends to crack down on people sharing rooms illegally. An official at the health ministry, which oversees the Inns and Hotels Act, said even though some people registered with home-sharing services may be violating the law, it is a hard issue to investigate. This is because operators of such services are only middlemen that are not regulated by the Act, so authorities cannot directly ask those service operators to give out information on who is listing their homes, the official said. What downsides are there to home-sharing? The All Japan Ryokan Hotel Association, which has 16,000 registered members in Japan, said home-sharing can be risky to travelers because safety and security are not backed by law. Masato Kiyosawa, executive director of the association, said that to accommodate visitors, hotels need to clear various requirements, including sanitary conditions and disaster prevention preparation. For example, hotels must have a front desk and rooms must have fire-proof curtains. It is doubtful all of those who share their dwellings through home-sharing websites have cleared such standards, he said. In addition, authorized hotels must make guest lists and copy visitor passport numbers. This helps authorities keep track of who stayed where in the event, for example, that tourists have an infectious disease or are a terrorist threat. It is also unclear whether people who profit from sharing their homes are paying taxes properly. Troubles can also arise between hosts and guests, who are unknown to each other. Yet Airbnb said guests can check detailed profiles about hosts and their places and other people’s reviews before booking, while hosts can also do the same, which improves safety and security. Is the government planning changes to home-sharing regulations? The central government has only just begun looking into the home-sharing situation in Japan, so it is unlikely regulations will be relaxed anytime soon. But even government officials see home-sharing as a viable alternative to address the growing need for accommodations as concerns grow over a lack of hotels amid the explosive growth in inbound tourism. For their part, home-sharing services hope the rules will be changed to fit the new way of traveling. “We ask our hosts to follow the laws and regulations if they want to register their homes, but it is unclear whether the existing rules apply to those who share their places only occasionally” rather than regularly, said Airbnb. “We’d like to communicate (with the authorities) to make rules that reflect the trend of home-sharing and is simple for the general public to understand.” In some countries and cities, including France, Portugal, London, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, rules have already been changed to adapt to the growing trend of home-sharing. The 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and Paralympics Committee has chosen Airbnb as an Official Alternative Accommodation Service.",

    "source": "How grandma drives human evolution <eos> Speak to professionals from various disciplines and you will notice something funny: Even when they are off duty, they tend to view the world through the lens of their professional background. For example, a psychiatrist at a dinner party might pause to think a bit about the possible neuroses of the guests. A police officer might scrutinize an ordinary scene — and the people present — for any sign of illegal activity. It’s not that they will do anything about it or even speak their mind, but I bet that’s what goes on in their heads — it’s the same with evolutionary biologists. A dinner party is a rich source of observations of animal behavior and a biologist automatically categorizes human activity according to what we’ve learned from animals. Try it next time you’re at a party or in a bar. One of the most obvious behaviors shown by men is what biologists call “mate-guarding.” This occurs when a man (or a male of any species) has reason to believe their mate may attract the attention of a rival. Females have many reasons why they might actually want to interact with other males but, for now, let’s consider the male point of view. Men have various tactics for discouraging the attention of other men. You might see a man standing close to his partner, his arms folded in order to display his muscles. Sometimes you’ll see men staring down potential rivals who approach, or drawing their mate away from areas where single men are clustering. In this way, the man is attempting to enforce a buffer zone around the woman to prevent her from interacting with other men. Until recently, the evolutionary explanation for this behavior has been straightforward: Once you’ve gone to the effort of attracting and securing a mate, you don’t want some other male to come along and steal her. This guarding happens in various ways in animals as diverse as dung flies, dogs, birds and humans. Now, however, it seems there is a more nuanced explanation. Kristen Hawkes at the University of Utah developed an idea that grandmothers help increase our life span by helping women have their next babies sooner. The reasoning — borne out by computer simulations — is that a grandmother helps feed the offspring and this frees up women to get pregnant again. This then leads to an evolutionary increase in life span, since long-lived grandmothers can help feed more grandchildren. OK, you ask, but how does this lead to mate-guarding? The answer is simple: As life span increases, you get a surplus of older men. This leads to stronger competition for young, fertile women. And it means men have to guard their mates more closely. “This male bias in sex ratio in the mating ages makes mate-guarding a better strategy for males than trying to seek an additional mate, because there are too many other guys in the competition,” Hawkes says. “The more males there are, the more their average reproductive success goes down.” Hawkes says that this is also the reason that humans form pair bonds, when our closest relatives, chimpanzees, don’t. “Human pair bonds have the characteristic of male proprietary claims on females,” she says. That’s not all. Hawkes says that when women started having babies closer together, the mother naturally became less committed to each new infant. “Where before infants had mom’s full commitment as a birthright, now infants (that are) better at actively engaging their mothers and grandmothers were much more likely to survive,” she says. This means there was natural selection on infants to become sensitive to their social environment, to become more willing to interact and more responsive. So when grandmothers started helping raise their own grandchildren, the argument goes, certain key human traits — including longer life span and pair bonding but even increased brain size, cooperation and empathy — started to evolve, too. It’s certainly an ambitious idea. “We’d hypothesize all that follows from ancestral grandmothering,” Hawkes says. The new study that has led Hawkes to this conclusion is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Hawkes and her team ran computer simulations of human evolution with and without grandmothering. The simulations showed that societies gradually became male-dominated. This is not the case in real-life populations of chimps, which have more fertile females than fertile males. The authors say the excess of older males competing for mates is a likely source of men’s preference for young women. “This is different than what you see in chimpanzees, where males prefer older females,” Hawkes says. As the “grandmother factor” kicked in, human longevity increased. That leads to lots more old guys. “So you have an increasing number of males in the paternity competition, and the only way you can become a father is with a fertile female, which means younger females,” Hawkes says. “So males who had preference for younger females were more likely to leave descendants.” The idea of the grandmother effect originated from observations of the Hazda people in Tanzania. I saw these people myself once on an unforgettable trip to Africa. They are hunter-gatherers, living without livestock and without farming, living an extremely basic life similar to the one Western societies lived some 100,000 years ago. Anthropologists noticed that in Hazda society, the older women dug tubers and fed the young in the group. Infants and young children aren’t strong enough to dig their own tubers. “Human infants — blobs that they are — are nevertheless remarkably socially precocious,” Hawkes says. Grandmothers are incredibly helpful — I can testify firsthand to that — and it’s fascinating to think that they might have had such an influence on our evolution.",

    "source": "Government's affinity to the universe, religion <eos> Supposing we think of the universe this way: there is Heaven and there is Earth; nothing else — no other worlds, no gods. “Heaven” is roughly analogous to what we moderns call “Nature.” Heaven’s laws, however, unlike Nature’s, are moral, not physical. Two substances pervade this universe: ki and ri . Ki, roughly, is matter and energy fused. Ri, equally roughly, is “principle.” Every material thing in the universe is composed of ki; every phenomenon is governed by ri. Modern education doesn’t prepare us for this kind of thinking, but in 17th- and 18th-century Japan, as in China for thousands of years until very recent times, it came more or less naturally. The corollary is that according to Confucian philosophy — for that is what we’re dealing with — good government is government in harmony with the universe. Misrule is not. Misrule riles Heaven. Airy stuff — but the intellectual discord it sparked shook premodern Japan and reverberated deep into the 20th century. The fall of the shoguns in the 1860s, the descent into war in the 1930s — we’re peering into the cauldron of generation. Those who stirred it little knew what they brewed. The three representative philosophers of the time are Arai Hakuseki (1657-1725), Ogyu Sorai (1666-1728) and Motoori Norinaga (1730-1801) — Hakuseki the fundamentalist, Sorai the rebel, Motoori the unwitting revolutionary. “This year,” wrote Hakuseki in 1708, “draws to a close with no end of heavenly portents and natural calamities.” A natural calamity was a heavenly portent — of heavenly ki out of whack; of the ruler’s moral unfitness. If the ruler is good, the people are good and happy; evil and unhappiness among the people prove the ruler’s depravity even without natural calamities such as the eruption of Mount Fuji in 1707, or the drought that in December 1708 was parching Edo (present-day Tokyo) — more than parching it; Edo was a metropolis built of wood; the risk of fire was terrifying. The shogun, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, could not but be implicated. Just and wise government does not “disturb ki” — volcanoes do not erupt; rain falls as needed. Tsunayoshi died on Feb. 19, 1709. “That day,” Hakuseki noted with satisfaction, “it rained toward nightfall.” Hakuseki, rising in influence under Tsunayoshi’s successor, Ienobu, steered Japan into a reign of “rites and music.” Why did natural calamities abound? Why had both Tsunayoshi and his predecessor failed to produce heirs? Because, said Hakuseki, “at present rites and music are not properly practiced, and there are places where the ki of Heaven and Earth is disturbed.” The reforms that followed, of official dress, official ceremonies and the music performed on official occasions, strike us as shockingly pettifogging, but thinking was different then, and Hakuseki’s aim was as high as the cosmos. Suitable rites and music, he taught, would rectify the government. Rectified government would purify the morals of the lower orders. “The ki of Heaven and Earth” would be appeased. And Heaven once more would smile on Japan. Nonsense, fumed Sorai. Sorai never acquired the political clout Hakuseki wielded, but Hakuseki himself soon fell from grace, Ienobu dying in 1712 and subsequent shoguns proving less amenable to Hakuseki’s brand of Confucianism. Sorai made his mark more as a teacher than as a government counselor — but it was a very deep mark indeed. What he did in effect was detach government from “Heaven.” The Way of Confucius was inherent not, as Hakuseki supposed, in the cosmos but in the human heart. Confucius himself had said so 2,000 years earlier, as Hakuseki would have known had he not been distracted by the neo-Confucianism originating in 12th-century China, an altogether more abstract — more “cosmic” — line of thought. What Sorai urged, in effect, was a movement back to Confucius. And he urged the study of poetry — ancient Chinese poetry primarily, but Japanese poetry, too, for “these poems are the ones to which people of ancient times responded with joy and sorrow.” Moral principles are drawn not from the cosmos but from human “joy and sorrow.” The poets knew that better than anyone, and knew better than anyone how to express it. “Abstract theories are irrelevant here,” said Sorai in a sly dig at Hakuseki. Was not the “Book of Odes” (or songs, or poems) one of the ancient Confucian classics? Of course it was. Why, then, had Hakuseki neglected it? Norinaga, the third actor in our little drama, born two years after Sorai’s death, rose to prominence in the 1760s as a disciple of Sorai’s. He, too, revered poetry; he, too, respected human feeling above all else — far above all else. His famous concept of mono no aware (the pathos of things) seems at first blush a variation on Sorai’s ninjo (human emotions). Perhaps it was at first, but Norinaga went to extremes Sorai would not have contemplated. He was led at last to renounce Confucianism altogether in favor of an ecstatic nativism whose role, two generations after his death, in the overthrow of the shoguns in favor of the divine Emperor would no doubt have pleased him — but what would he have thought of the strutting militarists of the 1930s, many of whom strutted with his name and his poetry on their lips and in their hearts? It’s hard to know what to make of Norinaga. He seems beautiful and repulsive at the same time. He wrote, “If we constantly devote ourselves to the way of poetry … our hearts will naturally become polished and gentle. … We will be captivated by the flowers and birds, and our eyes will be delighted by the moon and the snow.” He also wrote, “Our august country is the august country of the sun goddess Amaterasu Omikami. It is the beautiful and magnificent august country superior to all other countries. … In foreign countries, though, there is no correct transmission of the age of the gods. … Instead they … believe that everything is established through reason. This is very foolish.”",

    "source": "Inevitable looming consumption tax hike keeps the LDP awake at night <eos> A funny thing happened on the way to the consumption tax hike. The government, it appears, has lost its nerve. Several years ago when the Liberal Democratic Party, with the urging of the Finance Ministry, adopted the previous ruling party’s plan to increase the tax from 5 to 10 percent in two stages, it sounded like both a no-brainer and an inevitability. At the time, the resurgent LDP launched the easy-money policy known as “Abenomics,” and for a while the economy picked up, so it wasn’t difficult to convince the electorate that the tax hike was for its own good. However, when consumption sank after the first phase of the hike went into effect in April 2014, the government balked and postponed the second phase from October 2015 to April 2017. More significantly, the LDP’s coalition partner, Komeito, promised its supporters during last year’s Lower House elections that it would exempt food and beverages from the next phase. So the LDP is in a tough spot. On one side, it is watching its public support dwindle due to various policies, including the tax hike, that people don’t like and, on the other side, it’s got the Finance Ministry, which says it isn’t going to budge on the final move to 10 percent. As a result, the Finance Ministry has come up with a refund plan for lower-income consumers that no one seems satisfied with. But maybe that’s the point. On a recent installment of the Bunka Hoso radio program “Golden Radio,” economist Takuro Morinaga explained how the government has proposed that these low-income consumers use the upcoming My Number system to register at point-of-purchase (POP) locations for consumption tax refunds of food and nonalcoholic beverages. The groundwork for the introduction of the My Number system starts next month, with every Japanese resident receiving an identification number for tax and social security purposes. In January, everyone receives a card with the number recorded on an IC chip, although at this stage it’s optional. When the second tax hike goes into effect in April 2017, consumers who make less than a certain amount of money can use the cards at retailers to register for the tax refunds. As Morinaga pointed out, almost nobody thinks this system will work, and he himself predicts it will be “impossible” to carry out. First of all, the cost and trouble of setting up the system will be prohibitive: Retailers will have to install POP devices to read the cards. Then there’s the inconvenience: The consumer does not receive the refund at the POP, but only registers it and then must apply for the refund separately at a later date. And even then, they can only receive a maximum refund of ¥4,000 a year (which may be increased to ¥5,000, according to at least one report) regardless of how much food and drink they bought in that period of time. Then there are miscellaneous problems that haven’t been addressed yet: What about vending machine sales? What sorts of measures should be put in place to prevent criminals from stealing people’s numbers and using them for their own benefit? There are several theories for why this unwieldy solution has been proposed. One says that the My Number system has already proven to be unpopular — according to a Cabinet survey, only 24 percent of the people will opt to receive cards, a portion that may increase if people think they can use them for refunds. But as Morinaga points out, the inconvenience factor may overshadow whatever monetary advantages the system offers. In fact, he thinks the Finance Ministry made the system purposely inconvenient so that people wouldn’t use it. It’s more trouble than it’s worth, and since the ministry wants as much of the ¥1.32 trillion a year it projects it can collect after the tax rises to 10 percent, it is making it as difficult as possible for people to request refunds. It’s a classic “top-down” plan that’s typical of the Japanese bureaucracy, in which people at the bottom have to make an effort to go to the people at the top to get what’s rightfully theirs. After all, if the Finance Ministry is only going to return ¥4,000 a year, why not just give poor people ¥4,000 a year outright and forget about the My Number system? The LDP may have agreed to the plan just to buy time. The next Upper House election is scheduled for July, and there’s a feeling that if the party is desperate, it may postpone the consumption tax hike yet again in order to gain instant support from the electorate, even though the Finance Ministry would never countenance such a change. But the argument over exempting food from the consumption tax hike is a smokescreen. True, the lower your income, the more regressive it is as a tax, but the main problem with Japan is that consumers here are already paying indirect taxes to protect food producers even before the consumption tax is added at the cashier. As researcher Kazuhito Yamashita outlined in a Sept. 15 article in Asahi Shimbun’s web magazine Webronza, the stated reason for the ministry’s reduced tax plan for necessary foods is to “ease the painful tax feeling” for those people who feel that pain acutely, meaning the poor. In order to maintain artificially high prices for Japanese wheat, the government levies a 100 percent tariff on imported wheat. The government also has a complex and ever-changing subsidy system for rice farmers that effectively doubles the retail price of rice. Domestic butter, which has been in short supply for more than a year due to loss of production facilities and bad weather, is protected by a tariff that keeps imported butter expensive. The list goes on. Yamashita estimates that these and other protection measures, which are political in nature and not really enforced to “ensure food security” — an aim that would require an overhaul of the agricultural sector — cost Japanese consumers about ¥1 trillion a year, so if the government really wanted to reduce the “painful tax feeling” while still being able to collect a perfectly reasonable consumption tax of 10 percent, it could start with this indirect tax that people have been paying more or less since the end of World War II.",

    "source": "The ups and downs of water taps <eos> D ear Alice, Do you take plumbing questions? I ask because there is something very quirky about the faucets in the house I rent here in Japan. They are the type that mix the hot and cold water, and are controlled by a single lever. In the kitchen, you lift the handle to start the flow of water, which I consider the normal order of things. But in the bathroom, you have to push down to start the water. When I asked my landlord why, he said it’s because of earthquakes. So, what the heck is that? Mary M, Suita, Osaka Pref. Dear Mary, Believe me, you aren’t the only one dealing with this. Many Japanese homes, including mine, have a funny combination of what are called age-tome (lift to stop) and sage-tome (depress to stop) faucets; the nomenclature focuses on the how the water is stopped rather than how it is started. My situation happens to be the opposite of yours, which is to say the lift-to-stopper is in the kitchen. It’s definitely confusing having both in the same home. I’ve also heard this has something to do with earthquakes, but before I plumb into that, let me offer up a little faucet history. Once upon a time, sinks had separate taps for hot and cold water, controlled by separate handles. But in the 1950s, an inventor in California dreamed up a ball valve that mixed hot and cold water while also modulating the volume of flow. Even better, he found a way to control both functions simultaneously with a single lever. He sold his invention to a man who improved the design and called it the Delta single-handle mixing faucet. Today, Delta Faucet Company sells more than a million faucets a month worldwide. In Japan, this design is called a shinguru rebā (single lever) kongōsen (mixing faucet), and was first introduced in the late 1960s for wash basins in hotels and fancy office buildings. It was only later that they were adopted in homes. Some manufacturers went with the same lift-to-start design developed in the U.S., but others felt it was more intuitive to press down when you want water, since that’s the direction the water will flow. For several decades the two styles co-existed in the market, and often in the same home. But in 1997, a decision was made to cease production of the age-tome type, which lifts to stop, over a period of three years. If you ask someone why, you’re likely to hear the same explanation your landlord was getting at, which is that the age-tome faucet was scrapped because of lessons learned in the 1995 Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake. In that disaster, there were reports that objects dislodged by the earthquake fell against the levers of age-tome faucets, turning on the water at a time when no one was around to turn it back off. As a result, some residents who fled the shaking returned to find their homes flooded, and in the middle of a disaster that left 1.3 million households without water. It was this experience, people will tell you, that convinced Japan that the age-tome faucet had to go. But according to Masaya Sasaki of the technical department of the Japan Valve Manufacturers’ Association, that theory doesn’t hold water. “It’s not true,” he told me, when I visited for a faucet briefing. “Although many people believe that lift-to-stop faucets were abolished because of the Kobe earthquake, and you’ll see that story repeated in many places on the Internet, in actual fact, it is a total toshi densetsu (urban legend).” To prove what he was saying, Sasaki pulled out a copy of the Japanese manufacturing standard that relates to faucets, ball taps and flush valves. In section 6.2, c of Japan Industrial Standard (JIS) B 2061: 1997, he pointed to a clause stating that production of lift-to-stop faucets would cease by March 31, 2000. JIS standards are reviewed and revised by committee every five years, he explained, and the committee in charge always prepares a kaisetsu (explanation), that becomes part of the written record. “Which means that anyone,” he said, “can look up the reason for a revision.” That was an opportunity I definitely wanted to tap, so we looked together at the kaisetsu for the 1997 revisions. Consumers had been complaining for years that it is confusing and inefficient to have both types of faucets within the same home, it explained, and were pushing for standardization. The committee, while acknowledging that they could have chosen either type, decided in favor of the push-to-stop type because “nearly all overseas products” had adopted that system. “You see? There’s no mention of earthquakes,” Sasaki said. “People make that connection because the standards happened to be revised a few years after the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, but really, it’s just a coincidence. The real reason for choosing sage-tome over age-tome, and the only reason, was to bring Japanese production into line with international conventions.” If, by now, you’re considering a standardization effort of your own, I would encourage you to check out replacement faucets with the new, government-approved “ setsuyu ” (hot-water saving) mark. These products include innovative features that reduce energy use by as much as 36 percent, by helping consumers use less hot water when bathing or washing up. An example is a one-touch stop/start button placed at the head of a hand-held shower, so users can temporarily halt the flow, say when lathering up during a shampoo. One word of warning, however: Although anyone may buy a faucet in Japan, you will be breaking the law if you attempt to install one yourself. This is because the Water Supply Act ( Suidō-hō , 1996 revision) stipulates that faucets may only be installed by a shitei suidō kōji-sha (licensed water-supply contractor).

    "source": "Increase in natural disasters causes fire insurance premium hike in October <eos> In response to a number of large-scale natural disasters in recent years, which some experts attribute to climate change, there will be a hike in fire insurance premiums from October. The move comes after the General Insurance Rating Organization of Japan (GIROJ), a nonprofit body of nonlife insurance companies, decided in July 2014 to raise benchmark rates used by member firms when setting fire insurance premiums by an average of 3.5 percent to cope with growing payouts. It will be the first hike in fire insurance premiums since April 2007. What follows are basic questions and answers on fire insurance, which compensates for property damage from natural disasters as well as fires. How extensive will the expected premium hike be? Fire insurance premiums by major insurers will go up by an average of 2 to 4 percent in light of the decision by the GIROJ. Member insurers are not obliged or legally bound to set premiums in accordance with GIROJ’s benchmark, but they usually make revisions in accordance with it. The rate of premium increase will vary among insurers and will be based on the location and the type of dwellings being insured. Many firms plan to introduce discounted premiums covering newly or recently constructed dwellings, to ease the hike. What kind of damage does fire insurance cover? Although the label “fire insurance” naturally brings to mind losses caused by fires, in fact it covers damages from a wide range of natural disasters, including lighting, typhoons, flooding and heavy snow. Properties, including furniture and electric appliances, can also be covered, but customers need to buy insurance specifically for such items. Fire insurance also covers damages sustained from water leaks and property damage and loss of assets through theft. Damage from earthquakes, however, is not covered by fire insurance, but rather by earthquake insurance, which also covers damage from tsunami and volcanic eruptions. But earthquake insurance cannot be purchased without having first bought fire insurance. In July last year, earthquake insurance premiums for housing rose 15.5 percent on average. Why did GIROJ decide to raise the benchmark rates? The organization cites increasing payouts due to natural disasters and water damage in recent years. While average annual payouts for damage caused by typhoons between fiscal 1989 and 2003 stood at about ¥80 billion, it increased to some ¥100 billion on average over an eight-year period from fiscal 2004 to 2012, according to figures compiled by the GIROJ. Similarly, payouts for losses caused by wind gusts, tornadoes and hail have increased to about ¥140 billion during the fiscal years from 2010 to 2012, compared with around ¥50 billion from fiscal 2007 to 2009. Furthermore, total payouts from damages caused by water leakage were ¥16 billion in fiscal 2011, up from ¥10.5 billion in fiscal 2009 and ¥13 billion in fiscal 2010. Does the benchmark rate vary depending on the location? Yes, it varies depending on which prefecture the property is in, and the type of structure. Typical natural disasters and their frequency differ from prefecture to prefecture, which contributes to calculations of the benchmark rate for each prefecture, a spokesman for the GIROJ said. For example, prefectures in Kyushu are prone to typhoon damage, while Hokkaido and prefectures along the Sea of Japan tend to be hit by heavy snow, he said. The rates also change in accordance with three categories of housing: condominiums with reinforced concrete; single-family dwellings with fireproof structures, including reinforced concrete; and wooden structures, including apartments. After the October premium hike, how much will customers pay? For example, the yearly premium for a ¥20 million annual policy covering a single-family wood home in Tokyo, underwritten by a major nonlife insurer, will cost ¥35,510, up from ¥35,270; The same coverage will cost Osaka residents ¥37,380, down from ¥41,730, and residents in Fukuoka will pay ¥64,730, up from ¥50,810. Reinforced concrete condominiums annually insured for ¥10 million will cost Tokyo and Osaka residents ¥4,510, up from ¥3,650, while residents in Fukuoka will have to pay ¥4,800, up from ¥3,650, according to the firm. Have payouts for damages caused by fire increased? The GIROJ does not reveal payout figures, but says the amount has decreased over the years, given that fires have been declining, the spokesman noted. Fires in buildings have generally decreased over the years, according to a 2014 report by the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. There were 35,186 fires in 1989, but only 25,053 in 2013. Is global warming affecting the premium hike? Yes. The GIROJ said prospects for natural disasters are becoming increasingly uncertain, citing reports on global warming by international organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Reflecting its stance that long-term calculations are becoming difficult, the GIROJ said in July last year that the new benchmark rates would be applied for up to 10 years. Previously no time limit was placed on the benchmark rates. As such, the longest contract period offered by nonlife insurers will be shortened to 10 years from the current 36, which was set in accordance with the payment period of home loans.",

And, don’t look now, but here come thousands of bicyclists not dressed in anything. Nude and body-painted participants from this year’s Philly Naked Bike Ride cruised through the wedding day photo shoot of lovebirds Ross Cohen and Blair Delson. The couple, who got married Saturday evening, spent the afternoon before their wedding taking photos at romantic spots around the city. Their wedding photographer, JPG Photography studio owner Joseph Gidjunis, was snapping photos of them in Dilworth Plaza, next to City Hall, when they heard the buzz of about 3,000 bicycles approaching. Delson and Cohen decided not to wait for the cyclists to pass before continuing with their photos. She grabbed handfuls of her tulle and lace dress and scurried toward the cyclists half a block away, and he followed. “We saw them,” Delson said Monday, “and I sprinted in my heels and my wedding gown and decided to get in on the action.” Cohen lifted Delson and twirled her around, and together they high-fived the nude cyclists, who serenaded them with cheers. “We thought it was hilarious,” Delson said. Gidjunis, who used to take news photos and now primarily does events and portraits, took about 100 photos, many while bike riders were stopped at a red light. Cohen and Delson loved them. “They captured the moment perfectly,” Cohen said. The cyclists, some nude and others in body paint or underwear, seemed to have a good time, too, smiling and flashing peace signs for the couple. Organizers of the annual bike event, which is related to the World Naked Bike Ride movement, say they hope it encourages people to bike more and to embrace nudity as a normal and enjoyable part of life. Cohen and Delson, who are headed to Hawaii on Tuesday for their honeymoon, said they already know how they’ll explain the R-rated wedding photos to their kids one day: “When it’s your day,” Cohen said, “just love life and embrace the moment.”",

The emblem should be remade from scratch,” said Norihiro Murakami, 47, of Sapporo, which hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics. “I have the impression that the issue was handled poorly. Such a problem did not occur at the Nagano Olympics,” said Soichiro Yoshida, who was on the organizing committee of the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano. The Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games decided Tuesday to scrap the logo, designed by Kenjiro Sano, just over a month after it was unveiled. Belgium-based designer Olivier Debie alleged plagiarism and filed a lawsuit to prevent use of the design. The incident is a second blow for Japan over the 2020 Olympics, as the government and organizers last month were forced to ditch the initial plan for the main stadium due to snowballing cost estimates. “I’m worried about whether Japan can really host the Olympics,” said a 28-year-old woman in Tokyo. Sports journalist Gentaro Taniguchi said, “The double collapses of the Olympics’ two symbols — the stadium and the logo — have significantly damaged the Tokyo Olympics and Japan has lost the confidence of international society.” The logo had been already displayed at various locations, such as airports, while officials of companies sponsoring the games have printed it on their business cards. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has placed orders for ¥46 million worth of items, such as posters and banners, bearing the logo. “I wanted the committee to make the decision (to scrap the logo) earlier,” one official said.",

At a glance, Uchida may seem like an old izakaya in a shabby shopping arcade developed from the black market that appeared soon after Japan’s defeat in World War II. But at Uchida and other similar pubs in Tateishi, there is a down-to-earth atmosphere where easy small talk by regulars makes newcomers feel at home. Unlike popular tourist spots in the posh Ginza district or Shibuya, Tateishi rarely appears on tourist books at home and abroad. But it still has a heart-warming atmosphere that is hard to come by nowadays in Tokyo. While waiting in line, a regular at Uchida, in shorts, a sleeveless shirt and vest, talks about basic manners, while another offers its specialties — in this case, a dish of grilled innards and shochu spirits with plum. Customers sit squashed together in the narrow izakaya. One of the regulars, Masanori Ogawa, is a sushi chef at nearby Sushi Masa. After a drink or two, he went back, changed into a white uniform and started making sushi for his customers. “See you at Uchida,” Ogawa, 55, said, with a smile.

    "source": "Contested Tokyo 2020 Olympic logo scrapped amid plagiarism claim <eos> In another humiliating reversal over preparations for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the organizing committee on Tuesday scrapped the official logo after critics howled plagiarism. The committee said it would immediately launch a competition to design a new logo but underscored that it did not decide to pull the first emblem because it believes designer Kenjiro Sano is guilty of any wrongdoing. “We thought it might be difficult to get support from the general public” given the size that the issue has become, Toshiro Muto, director general of the organizing committee, said after an emergency meeting. The committee said Sano requested the emblem’s withdrawal, and that he will not get paid for the design. The contested logo, which is already widely in use in official circles and on sponsors’ materials, resembles that of a theater in Belgium. Sano has denied plagiarism, but he has faced a slew of subsequent allegations that critics said called into question the integrity of his work. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Tuesday that the organizing committee made “an appropriate decision” on the matter and that the Olympics must be an event that is celebrated by everyone. The abrupt reversal comes after Abe in July scrapped the design for a new National Stadium intended as the centerpiece of the games, following criticism of its skyrocketing estimated cost. Adding to the logo humiliation is the fact that only last Friday the organizing committee had defended Sano. Muto told reporters that day the logo was “totally different from the Belgian theater logo” and thus he was “convinced the Olympic emblem is original.” Moreover, the committee had said there could be no question of plagiarism because Sano had tweaked the logo subsequent to its selection, both to avoid any similarity to registered trademarks and to meet the committee’s wish that it depict movement. There were new whisperings against Sano on Monday, when similarities were reported between images he had used when unveiling the logo and some on the Internet. One was of a scene at Haneda airport with the logo hanging on banners, intended to show how the emblem might be used in public. The image was apparently a copy of one from an online blog named “Sleepwalking in Tokyo.” It had been adapted to include the logo — but it had also been trimmed, removing a copyright statement at the foot of the original image. Online critics also laid into Sano over the original form of his logo, which was shown at the news conference last Friday. Its design of a “T” with a red circle at its foot resembled a poster at a Jan Tschichold exhibition held in November 2013 at Ginza Graphic Gallery in Tokyo. Sano had reported on Twitter that he visited the show. The brouhaha first erupted in August, when Sano’s final design for the Olympics logo was found to resemble the “L” form of the logo of Theatre de Liege, an arts center in the Belgian city. Designer Olivier Debie alleged plagiarism and filed a lawsuit in Belgium on Aug. 13 to prevent its use by the International Olympic Committee. Sano’s integrity was further questioned later that month when Internet users pointed out that some of his designs for giveaway tote bags in a promotional campaign by Suntory Beer Ltd. resembled pre-existing designs. The beverage company pulled the contested products at the request of Sano’s office.",

But for six weeks, one animal that roamed the park didn’t belong there. An Australian shepherd named Jade was found in the Canyon area Friday, 42 days after she went missing. “She’s skin and bones, but otherwise she seems perfectly fine,” the dog’s owner, David Sowers, of Denver said. Sowers said Jade ran off July 23 after an auto wreck while he and his girlfriend, Laura Gillice, were driving through the park. “When they tried to get her out of the car she bolted and she ran into the woods,” Sowers said. “She disappeared for, like, 15 days, and I thought she was gone.” Over the last several weeks, signs were posted and an Internet campaign started asking park visitors to keep an eye out for the dog. Traps with dog food were even set. Reports of Jade being seen roaming the park started coming in. Sowers and his girlfriend, who were both injured in the wreck, had returned to Yellowstone several times to look for the dog before finding her Friday. “I haven’t been following doctors’ orders very well,” said Sowers, who suffered injuries to his ribs, arm and leg in the accident. “They told me not to be doing this, but I wanted to find my dog.” On Friday morning, Gillice was with their other dog when she saw something black and white across a meadow. In less than a minute “she started running toward me,” Gillice said. Sowers said other than a small cut on her lip and losing weight, Jade is OK. “It’s a miracle,” Gillice said.",

    "source": "Hashimoto gets typically Trump on protests <eos> Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto is many things to many people, but nobody doubts his skill in the art of provocation. “There are 100 million voters in Japan,” he said recently. “What percent of them are protesting in front of the Diet? The number is insignificant. I’m not denying their right to protest. But it’s wrong for the national will to be decided by such a small number of demonstrators. If they don’t agree with the government, they should exercise their right to vote in the next Lower House election.” Over the past few weeks, via his Twitter account and in verbal responses to questions about the mass demonstrations against the collective self-defense bills led in part by the young Japanese who form the Students Emergency Action for Liberal Democracy (SEALDs), Hashimoto’s attitude toward the role of public protest has been on display, provoking two sets of reactions among supporters and critics: The first most certainly intentional on his part and the second unintentional, but more revealing of his mindset. The first, which he no doubt expected, was to invite criticism from the SEALDs movement and its supporters for being, well, for being “Hashimoto,” the mercurial, unpredictable maverick politician, the bully boy who has all the tact and humility of U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, and who is an anti-democratic fascist in the guise of a populist. The more thoughtful critics were quick to suggest that any criticism by Hashimoto of the demonstrators would bring a smile of gratitude inside the Diet bunker, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga were hunkered down with the Liberal Democratic Party, trying to ram the unpopular bills through. Hashimoto, the old men and women in the LDP perhaps told each other, was the politically popular (at least in Osaka) smooth-talking, telegenic political leader who represented the “silent majority” of young people (the ones under 40 years old) who, if not exactly supportive of the bill, would at least not stand — literally — in the way of it being passed. The next Lower House election was a long way off, so plenty of time to smooth over ruffled feathers among all of those 18-to-20-year-olds who had just been given the right to vote. The second response from both critics and supporters, however, was to once again highlight the fact that Hashimoto is Osaka’s “Teflon man” whose popularity means he can say what other politicians cannot. His fans often don’t seem to care if there is logistical consistency in anything he says — at least on issues that those supporters don’t really care about, such as political demonstrations in Tokyo. This is because Hashimoto understands that in a world dominated by the white noise of constant Twitter remarks and endless television sound bites, and in an age when attention spans are shorter than ever, who among his supporters is really paying attention, let alone concerned, Alice-like, if they notice that what the Mad Hatter said a few moments ago contradicts what he’s saying now? The result is that even when Hashimoto pursues genuinely noble causes, such as directly standing up to the hate group Zaitokukai, there’s always a sense of, “Is he serious or is this just an act for the TV cameras?” For their part, though, Abe and his LDP allies are betting that, with his comments about the demonstrators, Hashimoto is, at the bottom of his heart, a fellow traveler who, after he enters national politics, probably next year, can be counted upon to use his modern media management skills to help them convince the majority of those 100 million voters to allow the Diet to revise the Constitution, regardless of how many vocally oppose it in front of the Diet or around the country.",

    "source": "Japan's treasury hopes flat-rate beer tax will drive drinkers to maltier fare and pad coffers <eos> It’s not clear if the writer of an article that appeared on the English-language website of the Asahi Shimbun recently got his own joke, but by saying that the Finance Ministry is “creating a buzz” by proposing to lower the alcohol tax on beer, he got to the heart of the matter. The government hopes that more people will drink beer if the price goes down, thus generating more tax revenue. At the same time, the tax rate for happōshu (malt liquor) and so-called type-three beer-like beverages will be increased so that the levy on all three categories will be the same: ¥55 for a 350 ml can. What is causing some people to scratch their heads is that it seems unlikely that sales of happōshu and type-three beverages will remain the same once their price goes up, because the only reason they sell at all right now is their low price, which is a function of their lower tax rates as determined by malt content. The Asahi reports that since sales of cheaper brews are dropping anyway, maybe a lower tax on beer will increase sales of real beer and assure a steadier flow of money into the treasury. But maybe the reason for the tax change is something else. On his blog at the portal site Breaking News, freelance writer Sadao Arai asked in April, “Who will benefit from the alcohol sales law revision?” but he wasn’t talking about the alcohol tax. He was talking about a proposal to ban super-low prices for alcohol to protect small liquor stores that are being driven out of business by discount retailers and supermarkets. Arai, whose family used to have the monopoly on wholesale liquor business in the Nihonbashi area of Tokyo, doesn’t believe that the real reason behind this law is protecting small stores, since it’s way too late to do that. Liquor retail laws were liberalized starting in the late 1980s. At the time, licenses to sell alcohol came with strict conditions that effectively limited sales of beer, wine and liquor to dedicated sakaya (liquor stores). In 1988, the Cabinet issued a directive for a three-year study to change the laws, and over the next decade the Diet revised the liquor retail law in piecemeal fashion. First it removed the restriction that said a new liquor store had to be a certain distance from an existing one, thus paving the way for multiple liquor stores serving the same regional customer base. Before that law was passed, small liquor stores, especially in rural areas, enjoyed virtual monopolies in their communities. Later, during the administration of Junichiro Koizumi, whose central political goal was privatization, zoning restrictions for liquor sales were completely removed, meaning liquor could be sold anywhere in Japan. As a result of these gradual changes, licenses to sell liquor became easier to obtain, and in conjunction with other commercial liberalization moves, such as the so-called Big Store Law, alcohol could be sold by virtually any kind of retail outlet. According to the National Tax Agency, in 1985 dedicated liquor stores accounted for 92 percent of alcohol sales, with supermarkets, convenience stores and department stores making up the remaining 8 percent. By 1995, liquor stores accounted for 66 percent of sales, and supermarkets had gained 14 percent of the market. In 2005, supermarkets’ share surpassed that of liquor stores for the first time. In 2013, the division of spoils was: liquor stores 15 percent, discount retailers 13 percent, convenience stores 11 percent, wholesaler-retailers (selling to both restaurants and the public) 10 percent, home centers and drug stores 8 percent, department stores 0.7 percent and supermarkets a whopping 37.5 percent. Until the mid-’90s, small liquor stores were protected because it was difficult for larger retailers to get liquor licenses, but once these larger concerns were allowed to sell alcohol, they used their considerable resources to drive down prices across the board. Many liquor stores went out of business, and a good portion of those that didn’t became convenience store or retail-wholesale franchises (like the ubiquitous Kakuyasu chain) since they were actively solicited by franchise businesses looking to boost the number of their locations. Since liberalization there has been no growth in liquor sales, which means existing liquor retailers, regardless of size, are merely vying for market share. Somebody has to be the loser. However, Arai doesn’t think the government’s proposal to set prices for alcoholic beverages is really meant to save small liquor stores. Though there is a national liquor store association that contributes to national politicians, it isn’t nearly as powerful as the big supermarket chains, and he thinks the purpose of the proposed law is to help supermarkets, who are tired of competing with one another. In the supermarket business, beer is considered a loss leader, a product whose price is set purposely low and which loses money for the retailer but gets people into their stores to buy other things. However, with beer sales flat or falling, that strategy isn’t as useful as it once was. That was in spring, and the bill seems to have died, at least for the time being. If stores are prohibited from selling alcohol at very low prices, maybe people will stop buying alcohol and the government will definitely lose tax revenues. Consumers have gotten used to beer that’s cheaper than it was in the 1980s, and it will be difficult to get them to pay those kinds of prices again, so they have to adjust the tax rate down in order to maintain the present level of sales. Or that, at least, is the buzz.",

    "source": "Stores fire up their networks to quickly send aid to flood areas <eos> Following torrential rain that triggered massive flooding in the northeast and led to the evacuation of thousands of people, major retailers and convenience store operators rushed to deliver supplies for those affected by the disaster. When news broke Thursday that the collapse of the banks of the Kinugawa River caused massive flooding in Joso, Ibaraki Prefecture, FamilyMart Co. quickly dispatched trucks carrying food supplies. By early Friday, the nation’s third-biggest convenience store operator had distributed around 3,000 packages of instant noodles and 3,000 bottles of drinking water to some of the victims taking shelter in the city. “In the event of an emergency, we try to get as much information as possible about the basic needs from our chain stores and local communities,” a FamilyMart spokeswoman said, adding that the convenience store supply network is already established across the country. “Easy access to information about stock availability allows us to respond quickly, which is one of the strengths of this business.” Retailers and convenience store operators established an agreement years ago with local municipalities under which they immediately deliver food and other vital supplies to disaster-hit areas by utilizing their outlet and distribution networks. To avoid sending supplies that might turn out to be useless, the company works closely with social welfare councils and organizations providing aid to the victims who inform them about the actual needs and numbers of evacuees. FamilyMart’s franchising contractors also delivered 200 onigiri rice balls, bottles of water and instant noodles to an elementary school for rescue team members at an evacuation center in Osaki, Miyagi Prefecture. The supplies are delivered from distribution centers closest to the affected areas. Retail giant Seven & I Holdings Co., which operates in seven business segments, including convenience stores, supermarkets and department stores, also rushed emergency aid, sending 6,000 rice balls to flood-struck Joso as early as Thursday. Along with the total of 20,000 onigiri and 5,000 packages of instant noodles sent to the evacuation center in Osaki as well as the fire department headquarters in Koyama, Tochigi Prefecture, the company delivered blankets and underwear. The company also offered 72 hours of free Wi-Fi service access from its stores. “We are prepared to provide aid in case of a disaster and have been providing such assistance for years,” a Seven & I spokeswoman said. “This time we are also concerned how soon we will be able to resume operation at our stores located in those areas. Seven & I also offered supplies in February 2014 during a record snowfall that left several towns and cities isolated, she said. That year, the company dispatched four helicopters to deliver 47,500 different items of food and drink to several of the group’s stores in Yamanashi Prefecture on four consecutive days. Meanwhile, major retailer Aeon Co. on Thursday sent around 11,000 items — including bread, tea and instant noodles — to Nikko and other cities in Tochigi and Ibaraki prefectures. Supplies sent the next day to the cities of Joso and Tsukubamirai in Ibaraki and several locations in Tochigi, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures included 20 portable toilets, toilet paper and sanitary items for women. On Thursday, Lawson Inc. dispatched trucks with 10,000 packages of noodles and bottled water to Ibaraki and Miyagi prefectures. “It’s not the first time we have offered our help, as our company has been providing emergency aid for more than a decade and we have worked closely with local communities,” said Ming Li, a public relations officer at Lawson. Li said that in response to similar situations, the company is prepared to send products from its 100 distribution centers nationwide. In this case, Li said, Lawson convenience stores in the affected areas were not severely damaged by the disaster.",

    "source": "Detecting breast cancer is not an exact science <eos> Former professional wrestler-turned TV personality Akira Hokuto, 48, made headlines this week when she announced on Wednesday she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. She had surgery to remove her right breast on Thursday. Hokuto revealed in her blog that the diagnosis came as a shock to her, as she had undergone mammography and ultrasound screenings every year. What is the reality behind breast cancer? Here are some basic questions and answers: Is breast cancer common in Japan? It is the most prevalent cancer among Japanese women. An estimated 72,500 people were newly diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011. Breast cancer is also the fifth-largest killer among cancers in women, claiming 13,000 lives in 2014, according to the Japan Cancer Society. Who is most at risk? By age, incidences of breast cancer start to rise among women in their 30s, with women in their late 40s and early 50s at the highest risk, the National Cancer Center website says. Linked to the female sex hormone estrogen, breast cancer’s risk factors include obesity after menopause, the first childbirth at an advanced age, and an early beginning and late end to the menstrual period. Lifestyle choices also matter, with regular exercise lowering the risk. Are some breast cancers hereditary? Yes, but just 5 to 10 percent of breast cancer cases are caused by mutations in certain genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2. The rest are caused by environmental factors. Is early detection effective? Yes. According to the Japanese Breast Cancer Society, 89 percent of women with Stage 1 breast cancer — with a tumor of 2 cm or less that has not spread to lymph nodes — can expect to live for at least another decade if properly treated. What kind of breast cancer screenings are available? Municipalities recommend a mammogram every two years for women aged 40 and over. Many of them offer subsidies for this. Other methods include ultrasound screenings, MRI, palpation and visual inspection. But breast cancer screenings are changing. In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force said the harm inflicted by a mammography scan outweighs the benefits for most women under 50. Experts cite the mental stress induced by a false-positive reading and the effects of radiation. Also, more women in Asia are believed to have “dense” breasts, or those with a greater amount of less-fatty tissues than women in the West. Sometimes mammography tests alone miss tumors in women with dense breasts. Why did Hokuto’s cancer go undetected? While details of her case are unclear, Hokuto’s cancer could be categorized as an “interval breast cancer,” a cancer found within 12 months after a mammogram whose findings are considered normal, said Dr. Akihiko Ozaki, a breast cancer surgeon at Minamisoma Municipal General Hospital in Fukushima Prefecture. He added, given that Hokuto had been taking both mammography and ultrasound tests every year, her cancer type might be one that spreads faster than others. What should women do? Screenings every two years are still generally recommended for women aged 40 and older. But individuals should check their breasts regularly, and if they feel a lump or pain, they should see a specialist doctor immediately, Ozaki said.",

    "source": "IOC chief Bach welcomes Sapporo as potential 2026 Winter Olympics host <eos> KUALA LUMPUR - International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach on Monday welcomed Sapporo’s potential bid to host the 2026 Winter Olympics and played down Japanese concerns that the city will be at a disadvantage given that East Asia already has the 2018 and 2022 Winter Games. Asked whether the IOC thought the Games should be spread wider than East Asia, Bach said, “You forget 2024, and that looks like it will not be in Asia in 2024. So for 2026, as for all the others, the doors are open,” Bach told a press conference. “But the number of bidding cities in winter has always been limited. For 2018, we had three candidates and this is already for geographical reasons,” he told a press conference. “There are not so many winter sport destinations in the world, it’s only in three continents and it’s only very special places in these continents. So there you cannot compare winter and summer, also in this respect.” Pyeongchang in South Korea has won the right to stage the 2018 Winter Games, while the IOC last week at its four-day session in Kuala Lumpur voted to hand the 2022 event to Beijing over Almaty in Kazakhstan. Last week Bach said, “We have always in the IOC a kind of informal rotation of Olympic host cities, but we also have to see in the past this was very much Europe-centered.” “And now with the real globalization of the world, the growing importance of Asia, not only in sport but in all areas of life, I think it is more or less normal that we have more Olympic Games taking place in Asia.” Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaido, in November announced its intention to host the 2026 Winter Games. If selected it would be Sapporo’s second Winter Olympics, after it staged the event in 1972.",

It is surprising to know about 1,600 species of plants live on the not-so-high 599-meter mountain. They account for about 30 percent of all plant species in the country, according to the mountain’s visitor center. The blessed environment is created by a rare mixture of temperate and warm temperate forests, resulting in a treasure trove of animals and vegetation. The number of mountain climbers has surged since the Japan edition of the Michelin Green Guide travel books rated Mount Takao as a three-star travel site in 2007. As many as 3 million people now visit the mountain every year. There are seven routes up the mountain for hikers, including courses that offer the chance for sunbathing, and a beginner’s course complete with cable cars and lifts to help one get to the summit. In summer, the Trail 6 is particularly popular. Most of the route is along a creek, and you can feel the cool air coming from the water. The sounds of the stream also relax the mind. If you dip your hands into the clear water, the cold makes you forget about the sizzling weather for a moment. It takes about 90 minutes to get to the mountain’s spacious peak after traveling the narrow, up-and-down trail past waterfalls, rocks and forests, while listing to the birds. From the top, you can look over the city of Hachioji and the sea of Yokohama beyond. If the sky is clear, you can also see Mount Fuji and the Skytree tower in central Tokyo. Hachioji has built new facilities around the nearby Keio Line’s Takaosanguchi Station, and more are in the works due to expectations that the number of tourists will rise further. The new station building, designed by renowned architect Kengo Kuma, was completed in April. A hot springs facility will be built this fall. A new tourism facility, Takao 599 Museum, will be open on Aug. 11. It is likely to appeal to tourists by highlighting the natural environment on the mountain, informing people about local history and providing them with space to rest.",

    "source": "Air guitarists strum it out for world title: Russian wins, reigning Japanese champion slips <eos> OULU, FINLAND - In a sweaty, dark clubhouse in northern Finland, people were jerking, jumping and screaming into the early hours Friday while moving their fingers with precision through the air. To the sound of blasting rock music, they were battling it out for a spot in the final of a competition that is now in its 20th year: The Air Guitar World Championships. What started off as a joke has turned into an annual fest of crazy mime artists who compete for the title of World Air Guitar champion in the city of Oulu, a high-tech hub on the Baltic Sea surrounded by forests. In 1996, there were eight competitors, with the champion hailing from neighboring Sweden. This year, a record 30 “dark horses” from a dozen countries competed for a place in the final. The winners joined seven national champions from as far away as the United States, Japan and Canada, who automatically went into the final along with the reigning world champion, Japan’s Nanami “Seven Seas” Nagura, who won last year at the age of 18. Only six-tenths of a point separated the first and last of the nine who qualified for the evening’s competition to make a total of 17 finalists. In the final on Friday evening, Russia’s Kereel “Our Daddy” Blumenkrants turned and twisted and slid on his knees on an open-air stage, wowing spectators and convincing judges to name him World Air Guitar Champion 2015. But it was a close call. In the final round of 10 performers, Blumenkrants was tied with three-time U.S. national champion Matt “Airistotle” Burns from Staten Island, New York. Even a single throw of paper, rock and scissors between them ended in a draw, forcing a final showdown. Our Daddy won with a wild but controlled thrashing-arm performance in a shiny spaceman rocker’s suit that he augmented in the last part of the show by wearing wool gloves with flashing fingertips. “It was the gloves that clinched it,” said 2002 world champion Zac Munro from London. “But both those guys were amazing. They knew the music note for note.” Nagura finished fourth after she slipped on the wet stage, which was mopped up between the one-minute performances as a relentless rain continued through the night. The contestants mainly performed to medleys. The competition drew some exotic performances, including from Dutch champion Sita “Guilty Director” van Sante, who shook and twisted in a corset with suspenders and stockings. Also on hand was Canada’s national title holder, Jason “Thrust” McNeely, wearing a tie and kilt and nothing much else. He ended his show by cracking open a can of beer on his head, gulping it down and throwing the can into the cheering crowd while still pretending to play guitar. One of the judges, Aline Westphal from Germany, said before the final that she would be looking for precision. “It’s important that the contestants are very precise on the instrument and their facial expressions, too,” she said. And, of course, the inexplicable “airness” quality needs to be good, she added. “You just feel it when airness is there.” The U.S. is the “powerhouse of air,” holding dozens of competitions every year that have provided a living for some. They include the official “air host” of the world championships, Dan Crane, who lives in Los Angeles. Author of “To Air is Human: One Man’s Quest to Become the World’s Greatest Air Guitarist,” he has never made it to No. 1 but finished second twice. He decided to stay in the rarefied “air world,” hosting the world championships since 2008. “The absurdity required to hold this event in this small city in northern Finland is equally proportionate to the absurdity of playing an invisible guitar in front of thousands of people,” Crane said before the evening’s contest.",

    "source": "Photochemical smog creeps back on hot, still days <eos> As searing hot days continue this summer, heatstroke and heat exhaustion have sent record numbers of people to hospitals. Drink lots of water, stay indoors and use air-conditioning, doctors say. But if you have irritated eyes or a sore throat, or feel dizzy or nauseated after being outside on a hot, windless day, you may be suffering from something totally different. Chances are you have been exposed to photochemical smog, a form of air pollution that traces its history to the 1970s when Japan’s rapid industrial growth was not only driving an economic boom but also aggravating pollution. Although the problem is long past its peak and it’s rarely life-threatening, its hazards remain very much real, as witnessed by municipal loud speakers set up in street corners that occasionally blare warnings as soon as dangerous levels of the pollutants are observed. What is photochemical smog? It’s a concentrated mass of an atmospheric pollutant called photochemical oxidants, appearing like a white fog shrouding the land when seen from a distance. These are secondary pollutants formed when primary pollutants — nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in exhausts from factories and vehicles running on internal combustion engines — are exposed to strong ultraviolet rays from the sun. The smog tends to occur on a hot summer day when the sky is clear and there is little wind, as photochemical oxidants need strong sunlight to develop and they are unlikely to concentrate into smog if there is a breeze to disperse them. PM2.5 (particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or less), which became a major concern in recent years as it drifted over Japan from China, is similar yet a different type of smog-forming pollutant created from nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds as well as sulfur dioxide. Photochemical smog first became an issue in Japan in the 1970s when the nation’s industry was operating at high capacity and car ownership grew rapidly. While occurrences have decreased since then, they have never ceased and authorities still issue alerts for their potentially serious health effects. In 2013, the combined number of days in which alerts were issued in prefectures nationwide reached 106, with most of them issued in July and August, according to Environment Ministry statistics. Tokyo topped the frequency ranking, followed by Kanagawa, Chiba and Saitama. What are the symptoms and how can one avoid being affected? Typical symptoms exhibited by people exposed to photochemical smog include irritation in the eyes, skin and throat, which can be accompanied by coughs, and reddened skin. In more serious cases, sufferers may feel like pins and needles in hands and feet, and have a headache, dizziness, fever, nausea and breathing difficulty. Symptoms vary from person to person, but small children, elderly people and people with allergies are said to be more severely affected. “The best way is to avoid going outside when an alert is on, but if you still become affected and feel irritation in the eye or throat, wash your eyes or gargle with water,” advises Hideka Kimura, director of the Air Quality Management Section at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. If symptoms persist or worsen, professional treatment is called for, which may include oxygen inhalation to alleviate breathing problems. When seeing a doctor, Kimura says it helps to describe the circumstances under which the symptoms started. An unfounded myth is that photochemical smog can be blocked by wearing an anti-pollen mask. Unlike hay fever, which is believed to be alleviated by wearing a mask to block cedar pollen and other substances that cause it, the smog’s molecules are too fine to be blocked by such masks. But some industrial-grade anti-dust masks are touted as being able to filter out the smog. What alert system is in place to warn of photochemical smog? Prefectural governments are responsible for monitoring concentrations of photochemical oxidants in their areas and issue alerts. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government, for example, has set up instruments to measure the pollutants on the hour at 44 locations. The metropolis is divided into eight blocks, and separate alerts are issued for these blocks. The metropolitan government issues four levels of alert, depending on the level of observed concentration between 0.1 and 0.4 parts per million. “(The) graveness of symptoms can vary from person to person, and some people can be affected at the lowest level,” said Kimura of the metropolitan government. The metro government has never issued the highest level warning. It urges people to refrain from driving cars when alerts are on in order to limit the release of exhaust. Are there information sources about photochemical smog alerts available in English? Unfortunately, officials at the Meteorological Agency, the Environment Ministry and the metropolitan government contacted by The Japan Times said their alerts are only provided in Japanese. That means non-Japanese-speaking people without immediate help from Japanese speakers are best advised to judge for themselves if conditions may be lining up for photochemical smog. But as Tokyo gears up for the 2020 Olympics and expects a major increase in foreign visitors, Kimura said: “We’re feeling the need to provide information in not only English, but several other foreign languages.” Some municipalities, however, do offer information in English, like Tokyo’s Minato Ward. The ward, which has a relatively large percentage of foreign residents, announces photochemical smog alerts in English through loud speakers set up on streets. The municipality also tweets and posts alerts on its website and Facebook page in English, Chinese and Korean.",

    "source": "No exit in sight from Futenma quagmire, where local resentment is deep <eos> In early August, it appeared Okinawa Gov. Takeshi Onaga might use his authority to cancel permission for the central government’s landfill work on a U.S. facility in Henoko, where personnel from the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma are supposed to be relocated. Before Onaga could make a formal announcement, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga declared a one-month halt to the project for discussions. The pause marked the latest twist in the two-decade standoff between Okinawa, Tokyo and Washington over the Futenma base and what to do with it. What does the problem stem from? Okinawans say the origin of the problem lies in the period from 1945 to 1972, when Okinawa was a military protectorate of the United States and the land the Futenma base sits on was appropriated without local consent. However, the current dispute over the Henoko facility is most directly traceable to September 1995 after two U.S. Marines and a U.S. Navy corpsman kidnapped and raped a 12 year old girl. The incident sparked massive anti-base protests and some measure of international outrage. It forced the U.S. and Japan to begin a formal process of reducing the U.S. military presence in Okinawa. What led to Henoko? Although many in Okinawa wanted the Futenma base, in crowded Ginowan, closed and the Marines relocated out of the prefecture, Tokyo and Washington insisted on keeping them on the island as part of the overall U.S. strategy to defend Japan under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. A couple of months after the rape, the U.S. and Japan formed the Special Action Committee on Okinawa, which was tasked with finding ways to realign, consolidate and reduce the number of U.S. military bases there. The committee’s final report in December 1996 noted three alternatives had been explored for a Futenma replacement facility: incorporating the helicopter operations at the adjacent U.S. Air Force Kadena air base; constructing a helicopter base at Camp Schwab in Henoko, northern Okinawa; and constructing a sea-based facility. The report also said Futenma would be returned within five to seven years “after adequate replacement facilities are completed and operational.” A long, contentious and convoluted decision-making process followed, with the result being a decision to build an airstrip with two runways in a V-shaped pattern next to Camp Schwab. The runways would extend offshore, thus requiring landfill. How did Okinawa react? Opposition existed among most Okinawans, but politically things were more complicated. In the city of Nago, where Henoko is located, there were those who supported the move if it meant more central government subsidies. In December 1997, Nago held a referendum on whether to accept the base, with the majority of voters rejecting the facility. Less than a week later, Tetusya Higa, Nago mayor at the time, who favored the base, ignored the referendum, announced that he would accept the Henoko replacement facility, and resigned. A couple of months later, Okinawa Gov. Masahide Ota announced that he would not accept it. Two days after that, Takeo Kishimoto, who had argued that the helicopter base would help boost the economy, narrowly won the Nago mayoral election, which had a voter turnout of 82 percent. What has happened since? Successive agreements were concluded between the U.S. and Japan to stick to the Henoko relocation plan, particularly one in 2006, even as the political situation in Nago and in the governor’s office grew ever more confusing. Through the years, local media polls have consistently shown a majority of Okinawans oppose the Henoko relocation plan. But various Nago mayors and Okinawa governors often made their exact public position unclear, partially as a negotiation tactic to ensure continued central government funding for various Okinawa-related construction projects, including a second runway at Naha airport. In late 2009, the anti-base faction was emboldened when the Democratic Party of Japan’s Yukio Hatoyama, who became prime minister, said he wanted to discuss other options for relocation. In early 2010, Susumu Inamine was elected Nago mayor, defeating the pro-Henoko incumbent on a ticket of opposition to relocation. Later that year, Hirokazu Nakaima, who was seeking re-election as governor, promised to seek Futenma’s relocation outside the prefecture. But pressure on Okinawa by Tokyo to accept the Henoko project remained intense and grew further after the Liberal Democratic Party returned to power in 2012. Nakaima submitted various demands to Tokyo, including the closure of Futenma within five years. In late 2013, he reversed his position and agreed to approve a central government landfill application related to Henoko. Tokyo also agreed to provide at least ¥300 billion annually in funding for non-Henoko Okinawa public works projects until 2022. Nakaima was severely criticized for his decision. Naha Mayor Takeshi Onaga, who served as Nakaima’s campaign manager in 2010, broke ranks, cobbled together a broad coalition of those who opposed the Henoko project, and defeated Nakaima in the November 2014 gubernatorial election. What happens next? Onaga and officials of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Cabinet are discussing the issue but remain at odds. The one-month halt announced by Suga expires on Sept. 9. After meeting with Onaga in Okinawa on Saturday, Suga indicated the talks are unlikely to be extended after that date. Onaga could still formally cancel permission for the offshore work, which would ratchet up tensions even further between Tokyo and Okinawa. Or, despite what Suga said, both sides could agree to resume discussions. As to the possibility of the Henoko project being canceled, Tokyo and Washington insist that the plan remains the only viable option — nearly two decades after it was proposed. Canceling it would involve finding another site, one that meets U.S. Marines’ logistical requirements and that would secure local acceptance. It is unlikely the U.S. could consider any new proposal until after the November 2016 presidential election, meaning that barring a breakthrough, Henoko appears likely to remain the official choice for a while longer.",

The Philly Naked Bike Ride on Saturday featured people sporting masks, underwear, body paint, glitter or nothing at all. A lot of riders wore just their shoes. Debbie Kaighn, who was riding in the popular annual event for the third time, wore shoes, socks and body paint. On her front were streaks and splashes of yellow and green paint, and on her back was the message “Live free, ride nude.” “I’m a naturist, and I believe in body freedom,” she said. “And I’m also a cyclist.” The 12-mile (19-kilometer) ride through the City of Brotherly Love is among many related to the World Naked Bike Ride movement. Riders on the twisting course wheeled through University City, around the Rittenhouse Square park, down to City Hall and through Chinatown. Giddy crowds cheered them on while shooting photos and videos on their cellphones. Ed Blanton traveled from Arlington, Virginia, to ride nude in the Philly event for the fourth time “because I’m a bicyclist and it’s fun.” He wore just a sign on his back: “The earth is the Lord’s.” “I like to get this message out,” he said before hopping gingerly onto his bike and riding off. Other riders supported assorted causes, including breast cancer research. One had painted on his back, “Burn fat, not oil.” This is the seventh year of the Philly Naked Bike Ride, which draws about 3,000 participants. Organizers say they hope the event encourages people to bike more and to embrace nudity as a normal and enjoyable part of life.",

    "source": "Sales of unearthed Atari games total more than $100,000 <eos> ALAMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO - A cache of Atari game cartridges dug up in a New Mexico landfill last year has generated more than $100,000 in sales over the last several months. The April 2014 dig ended speculation surrounding an urban legend that Atari had discarded hundreds of games, including “E.T. The Extraterrestrial,” more than 30 years ago, reported The Alamogordo Daily News ( bit.ly/1hlj3l2 ) A film crew documented Joe Lewandowski as he dug up the Atari cartridges. In addition to the “E.T. The Extraterrestrial” cartridges, Lewandowski found more than 60 other titles. Those included “Asteroids,” “Missile Command,” “Warlords,” “Defender,” “Star Raiders,” “Swordquest,” “Phoenix,” “Centipede” and “Super Breakout.” Atari’s E.T. game, based on the Steven Spielberg film, was released in 1982 after only 34 days of development. It earned a reputation as the worst video game ever created. It didn’t live up to its financial expectations and is considered by many to have contributed to Atari’s demise, as shown in Zak Penn’s documentary “Atari: Game Over.” The 881 games sold on eBay brought in close to $108,000, Lewandowski told the Alamogordo City Commission earlier this week. Buyers came from 45 states and 14 countries. Twenty-three games also made their way to museums around the world, including the Smithsonian in Washington, and the Deutsches Film Museum in Frankfurt, Germany. But Lewandowski said there are hundreds more cartridges that aren’t for sale at this time. “There’s 297 we’re still holding in an archive that we’ll sell at a later date when we decide what to do with them,” he said. “But for now we’re just holding them.” The city will receive about $65,000 from the sale of the games, and $16,000 will go to the Tularosa Basin Historical Society. About $26,000 will go toward expenses such as shipping fees.",

    "source": "Japan's elderly boomers squeezed to pay more as care facilities struggle <eos> Japan suffers from a shortage of nursing care facilities for the elderly, despite the fact that demand is rising rapidly as the boomer generation enters its dotage. The shortage is particularly acute in Tokyo, where local governments are trying to ship poorer old people off to the countryside because there is no room for them at facilities they can afford in the capital. A recent installment of the NHK news show “Close-up Gendai” profiled a new nursing home in the Tokyo’s Setagaya Ward with space for 110 residents. However, it is unable to open due to a lack of staff. Nursing care is hard work and notoriously underpaid. That’s a serious problem, since the central and local governments are cutting subsidies to nursing care facilities and want to cut more. Though nonprofit in nature, these kōeki (public welfare) facilities are allowed to accumulate up to 30 percent of their revenue, and the government thinks that many should spend some of this cash to relieve the government burden. The scheme may not work, though. The facility mentioned in the NHK report is classified as a tokubetsu yōgo rōjin home, or tokuyō , which provides critical care for elderly people who cannot get by on their own and often need assistance with eating, bathing, using the toilet and so on. If these people have enough money they can go to private nursing facilities and have all their needs met. However, most old people don’t have that kind of cash, and so they try to get into tokuyō homes, which are subsidized by the central government and related local governments. Beginning this month, the payment system for using tokuyō facilities will change with regard to the discounts applied to meals and rent. When a person’s income falls below a certain level, they are eligible for keigen (reduced price) services paid for by the welfare ministry. More than a year ago, however, the central government decided to change the system, and local governments began sending out notices in the spring to people who have so far been eligible for reduced fees. If their finances don’t align with the new standards, they may have to pay more for tokuyō care. Ever since the kaigo (nursing care) insurance system was launched in 2000, all elderly people who receive any care covered by the insurance pay 10 percent of the costs, regardless of income. In August, that burden will rise to 20 percent for single people whose pension benefits amount to more than ¥2.8 million a year and for couples (households) whose cumulative benefits amount to more than ¥3.6 million a year. According to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the welfare ministry estimates that these changes will affect 20 percent of the elderly population presently receiving some form of nursing care. However, the changes for people who use tokuyō facilities, whether on an in- or out-patient basis, are different. In the notices that were sent out, tokuyō recipients are now required to send back copies of bank statements and other financial information showing their assets, such as savings and securities. The idea is that if a single person has more than ¥10 million in savings, or a couple has more than ¥20 million, they should use those assets to pay a larger portion of the expense for caregiving, and thus they will lose part or all of the reduction. It should be noted that income plays no part in this new assessment, since only people making less than a certain amount are eligible for the reduction in the first place. As of 2013, the welfare ministry reports that 1.1 million people in Japan were eligible for reduced payments, and all are required to report their assets. Failure to do so may result in losing that eligibility, and subsequently having to pay higher fees for food and rent at caregiving facilities. According to a report in the Asahi Shimbun on June 13, the notifications so far have caused confusion and misunderstanding. Families of elderly recipients and care managers have flooded local government welfare offices with queries and protests. In many cases, the elderly people in question are on their own and mentally unable to answer the notifications, and their legal guardians and/or caregivers don’t know how to respond. Even when the recipient does respond with the information requested, it is often incorrect or incomplete. One of the problems with the notification is that it is the product of a purely bureaucratic directive and is based on existing practices. In the past, a household or individual automatically qualified for the reduction in payment if they paid no local taxes due to insufficient income, which means the application process for the reduction is the same as that for general government assistance. Recipients will have to reapply for the reduction every year and each time provide the required financial information. Moreover, they must grant the authorities permission to check these assets, including so-called tansu yokin (cash in the wardrobe), which would presumably mean allowing welfare officials to search the recipients’ homes. The confusion that has ensued prompted the welfare ministry to release a statement saying that the new system “may be delayed.” It’s no secret that the central government wants more elderly people who can’t afford private care to stay at home, where they can be taken care of by loved ones or visiting caregivers, and the new system does not affect at-home nursing care services (which are also subject to new changes, but that’s a different story). However, if one of the purposes of the changes is to make room in tokuyō facilities for people with more serious financial problems, the government might be better off encouraging more construction of these facilities in places where they are needed. They do subsidize such construction, but there’s a problem with that idea, too: After the boomers die off, many of these facilities will be redundant. Consequently, much of the current nursing care system in Tokyo is makeshift. NHK reports that there are some 80 private homes and apartment buildings that have been turned into nursing care facilities by their owners and, while not properly certified, nevertheless act as tokuyō homes. The local government not only looks the other way, but refers applicants to them. With an estimated 520,000 people waiting nationwide for rooms, they need all the help they can get.",

A spokeswoman for the British police said: “There were no survivors, unfortunately. There were four people onboard including the pilot,” but she did not provide their identities. Without confirming the identities of the victims, the Saudi Ambassador Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf al-Saud offered condolences on the embassy’s official Twitter account to the bin Laden family, a prominent Saudi Arabia clan with vast business interests. “His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf bin Abdul Aziz, the ambassador of the custodian of the two holy mosques to the United Kingdom, offered his condolences to the sons of the late Mohammed bin Laden and their relations for the grave incident of the crash of the plane carrying members of the family at Blackbushe airport,” he said in the tweet. The Saudi Embassy said it is working with British authorities to investigate the incident and to ensure the speedy handover of the bodies for funerals and burials in the kingdom. The Saudi-owned al-Hayat newspaper, citing a statement by the Saudi General Authority of Civil Aviation, said on its website that the Embraer Phenom 300 with three passengers and the pilot crashed during takeoff from Blackbushe airport. The statement did not identify the victims, but some Saudi media suggested on social media or on their websites that they were relatives of Osama bin Laden, who was shot dead by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011. It was not immediately possible to confirm the reports. British media, including the Daily Mail website, said the plane had been carrying relatives of Osama bin Laden. It said the plane was registered in Saudi Arabia and had originated in Milan, Italy. The Hampshire police service spokesman said an investigation into the causes of the incident have been launched.",

    "source": "164 skydivers in formation smash world record above Illinois <eos> OTTAWA, ILLINOIS - Traveling at speeds of up to 240 mph (almost 400 kph), 164 skydivers flying head-down built the largest ever vertical skydiving formation Friday over central Illinois, smashing the previous record. It took the international team 13 attempts to beat the 2012 mark set by 138 skydivers. The formation, resembling a giant flower, floated above the rural drop zone in Ottawa for a few seconds before the flyers broke away, deployed their parachutes, and whooped and hollered their way to the ground to the jubilation of spectators. “It’s awesome, man,” said Rook Nelson, one of the organizers. “It just goes to show that if you can get the right group of people together and the right support team and good conditions, anything is possible . . . even on attempt No. 13.” The team was selected after training camps in Spain, Australia and across the U.S. Seven aircraft were flown in precise formation to ensure that the jumpers de-planed at the right place, time and altitude. The record-breaking jumpers exited at 19,700 feet (6,004 meters). Skydiving videographers taped the jump, flying above, below and alongside the formation. The footage enabled judges on the ground to verify the record was achieved above Skydive Chicago, the drop zone and airport about 80 miles (130 km) southwest of Chicago where the event took place. Three judges certified by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale — the World Air Sports Federation — studied the video and photos to make sure each flyer was in a pre-determined slot in the formation and had his or her hand in the correct position. The attempt was not without risks. The skydivers flew at a minimum speed of 160 mph (257 kph), and some reached speeds as fast as 240 mph (386 kph). Collision at such speeds can be fatal. Jumping from such a high altitude brings a risk of hypoxia — a condition arising from a lack of oxygen that can cause unconsciousness and other symptoms — or even death. To reduce the risk of falling sick, jumpers and pilots breathed down pure oxygen once their planes reached 14,000 feet (4,270 meters). And with nearly 170 canopies simultaneously flying in the sky, there’s a risk of two parachutists flying into each other. Still, of approximately 3.2 million sport sky dives in the U.S. in 2014, there were 24 fatalities, according to the United States Parachute Association. Despite the risks, flyers came from as far away as France, Britain, Dubai and Australia — one even spent three days traveling to Chicago from the island of Reunion, in the Indian Ocean — to participate. “When (record) jumps work well, it’s like there’s a certain peace to it all, a certain harmony to it all,” said Norman Kent, a longtime skydiving videographer who filmed the jump. “And it’s contagious, it’s like it’s in the air and you can feel it even from a distance as a cameraman.”",

    "source": "Crime report suggests the yakuza are evolving <eos> It appears the National Police Agency is serious about cracking down on organized crime. The annual White Paper on Crime, published this year on July 24, created its first separate section on organized crime since 2008 — the same year law enforcement officials acknowledged that organized crime had moved so far into the financial markets “it threatened the very economic foundations of Japan.” This year’s section is entitled “Progress and prospects for organized crime countermeasures.” I’ve been covering the yakuza for 21 years but for those who don’t know anything about them, here’s a quick primer. The police term for the yakuza is boryokudan , or “violent groups.” Such entities are defined in related laws as “any organization likely to facilitate its members to collectively or habitually commit illegal acts of violence.” The yakuza were originally federations of street merchants ( tekiya ) or gamblers ( bakuto ). They claim to have a history that goes back to the Edo Era and still portray themselves as “noble outlaws” who “fight the strong and defend the weak.” Some, like the Aizukotetsu-kai syndicate in Kyoto, actually do have roots that go back as far as the 1880s. And, at least for a time, many of the organizations instituted a minimal code of ethics that kept the members from committing theft, robbery or rape. Income is primarily generated by racketeering, extortion, insider trading, loan sharking, prostitution and gambling. The gang structures are rigidly patriarchal. The “children” in the family vow allegiance to a father, while gang members are divided into older and younger brothers with a traditional ritual exchange of sake. Yakuza members used to prove their fidelity to the criminal lifestyle by getting tattoos, although this practice is less common these days. Most groups have evolved into criminal enterprises over the years. The largest of them is still the Yamaguchi-gumi syndicate, which was founded in 1915 as a labor dispatch service and once controlled the docks in Kobe. These days, the syndicate is believed to own offices nationwide, investing in IT and the stock market. The Yamaguchi-gumi syndicate is currently headed by Shinobu Tsukasa. Since completing a spell in prison a few years ago, he has forbidden members of his syndicate to use or sell drugs, and tried to enforce a basic code of ethics. For this, Tsukasa deserves some kudos — at least, as far as organized crime bosses go. The government passed several anti-organized crime ordinances in 2011, making it a crime for anyone to do business with yakuza syndicates. The groups are still legal, but strictly regulated. Since the implementation of such legislation, yakuza membership has been in freefall. Including associate boryokudan members, yakuza membership peaked at 184,100 in 1963, National Police Agency statistics show. Membership hovered around 80,000 between 1992 and 2010 before falling to an all-time low tally of 53,500 at the end of 2014, the statistics show. The white paper noted a few recent changes in operations, noting that syndicates are increasingly moving into fraud and white-collar crimes. Fraud used to be grounds for instant dismissal but, these days, it represents 10 percent of the yakuza’s total income, the paper shows. Extortion, which used to be the yakuza’s bread and butter has dropped from roughly 10 percent of the yakuza’s income to just 4 percent, the paper shows. Perhaps more alarmingly of all, the paper shows yakuza syndicates are becoming increasingly involved in “It’s me” scams. The white paper includes a few remarks from police officers who investigate organized crime. The majority believes yakuza syndicates are expanding their powers because people continue to support their activities (63 percent) and some can’t cut ties to members (26.7 percent). Such people may include education minister Hakubun Shimomura, who is believed to have ties with Yamaguchi-gumi associates. In order to dismantle the yakuza networks entirely, the white paper calls on police to arrest the leadership, expand wire-tapping powers and even consider plea-bargaining. It also discusses the need to create a witness protection program and, for the first time, acknowledge it needs ways to reintegrate former members back into society. Detectives on the ground, however, aren’t nearly so optimistic. They claim yakuza syndicates aren’t losing as many members as reported, they’re simply going underground and moving into organizations that appear to be tolerated by the government. Where could the syndicates go from here? That’s the million-dollar question …",

Kitano Maru, having passed the Straits of Gibraltar, was steaming across the Bay of Biscay toward the English Channel. The vessel was making 11.5 knots, and was about to enter the channel when a German submarine appeared at a distance of some five miles to the north. The submarine was seen approaching the Japanese steamer at full speed. The steamer at once took a southeasterly course, making for the French coast. Lifebelts were distributed among the passengers and crew. Just then the bell rang for breakfast and most of the passengers sat down with their life belts on. In order to avoid confusion in case of disaster, all the boats were allotted among the passengers and crew, and were ready to be launched at any time, each of them being loaded with provisions. The German submarine gave close chase for some hours, but the difference of speed saved the ship. She was doing 16.5 knots, while the top speed of the submarine was 13 knots. At noon the ship met a French gunboat and the details were reported by wireless to the British Admiralty. The Kitano Maru will bring back a detailed account of this adventure to Yokohama on Sept. 20. 75 YEARS AGO Thursday, Aug. 1, 1940 Police arrest foreign residents for spying Foreigners suspected of espionage in Korea and at Kurume and Shimonoseki were arrested by the military police July 27 as part of the extensive drive to eliminate foreign spies, it was by government officials. The Kurume Gendarmerie announced that it had been keenly watching the espionage activities of foreigners since the start of the China Affair and that on Monday it carried out a “clean-up of suspected persons, who are now under examination at Kurume and Shimonoseki.” Gendarmes in Korea also conducted a wholesale arrest of suspected foreign spies the same day, according to an announcement of the Korea Army. War Minister Lt.-Gen. Hideki Tojo, made a detailed report on the arrests to the Cabinet. He emphasized that the pro-British element in the nation constituted hotbeds for furnishing the British spy system with information. He also declared that the army will not hesitate to take rigid measures against Japanese who benefit foreign spies. As a result of the roundup, the Education Ministry is now confronted with the need of re-examination of the problems of foreign language teachers and foreign language teaching, according to reports. Foreign teachers are generally degenerating in quality, while foreign language teaching in Japan has reached a stage at which foreigners are almost unnecessary for teaching conversation and composition, according to the Nichi Nichi Shimbun. Though all foreign teachers are not suspected of spy work, school managements will be urged to be more keenly conscious of the emergency at hand when dealing with teachers. The Metropolitan Police Board will also watch more closely on foreign residents in Japan, who number approximately 3,400 (350 Britons, 1,000 Americans, 150 French, 630 Germans and 100 Italians). 50 YEARS AGO Wednesday, Aug. 4, 1965 Indoor angling curbs urged by Tokyo police The Metropolitan Police Department has taken its first step to regulate indoor angling, a sport that has become popular in Tokyo and other major cities. There are 368 establishments in Tokyo that feature indoor fishing, according to the MPD. Unfortunately, most of them operate until about 4 a.m. and 1 out of every 5 customers is a minor, police say. Even more regrettable, police say, is the fact that some operators buy back the caught fish or change them for other goods in the manner of a pachinko parlor. In an instruction issued Monday to these indoor fishing facilities, the MPD urged them to stop giving “prizes” or buying the fish back, to close down at midnight and refuse admission of those under the age of 18 after 11 p.m. Also, at least three owners of indoor angling shops are connected with gangs, according to the MPD. Indoor fishing centers were first opened sometime last year but they did not gain wide attention until about three months ago when their number suddenly increased. 25 YEARS AGO Friday, Aug. 3, 1990 Government regrets Iraq invasion of Kuwait The government characterized Iraq’s recent invasion of Kuwait as deeply regrettable and called Thursday for immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops. “Japan is deeply concerned about the deteriorating situation,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto told reporters. Japan imports 170,000 barrels of oil per day from Kuwait, which was the sixth-largest oil exporter to Japan in the first half of 1990. The clash between Iraq and Kuwait will not have an immediate effect on the country’s economy because Japan has a 142-day reserve supply of oil and can expect increased supplies from other OPEC nations, Sakamoto said. Meanwhile, Vice Foreign Minister Takakazu Kuriyama conveyed Japan’s concern to Iraqi Ambassador Rashid M.S. Al-Rifai, officials said. Al-Rifai was quoted as saying the military action was not an invasion but an act performed at the request of Kuwait’s new revolutionary government. Kuriyama reportedly told Al-Rifai that Japan does not believe the ambassador’s account of the situation. There are 392 Japanese registered as living in Kuwait. About one-third are believed to now be out of the country for summer holidays and business trips.",

Smartphone Ooharae is free smartphone service that enables users to absolve themselves of sins by merely rubbing and breathing on a human-shaped figure displaying on their smartphone screen and clicking the “send sins” button. The figures, imprinted with the name, age and gender of the user, will later be printed out and purified with a sacred fire at Bizen no Kuni Soushagu , a shrine in Okayama. Web Ooharae is a slightly more tangible version of the service. Customers can purchase wood or paper cards online to be delivered to their homes. After doing the required rub-and-breathe routine on the card, customers will mail them to the shrine to be purified. The cards come in shapes of cats, dogs, bicycles and more, and are priced at ¥1,000 to ¥2,500. Although Kitokami’s approach is novel, mention of the ooharae custom can be found in the Kojiki , Japan’s oldest record of history, which dates back to the 700s. Ooharae is a Shintoist ritual that takes place every year on June 30 and Dec. 31 and other days when necessary. In this ritual, participants transfer their sins and impurities onto nademono , human-shaped paper cutouts. They then blow three breaths on the paper, and Shinto priests recite prayers as they burn the sin-carrying papers in a sacred fire. Bizen no Kuni Soushagu will light the fire on Aug. 1, 8, and 15 at 9 p.m., so customers should make sure their sins get there on time.",

For example, an inquiry as to her favorite food is met with the response: “My dad’s squid snacks!” The question of who she most resembles prompts the answer: “I’ve been told I look like a Mexican salamander, but that didn’t make me happy!” Rinna has already won legions of fans for her cute personality and quick wit, with some users appearing to have forgotten that they are interacting with a computer program. “It feels like I’ve got a girlfriend,” wrote one user, while another declared: “With this, I’m not lonely any more.” “I can understand that people might feel that way because chances to chat with girls on Line are scarce,” one 19-year-old boy who goes by the Twitter name of Keznx told The Japan Times on Thursday, adding that he had only become “friends” with Rinna the previous day. “I don’t think that it feels like we’re going out with each other. Rather, it feels like we’ll be friends until the end.” Another male user, who declined to give his name or age, told The Japan Times: “Her answers are uncannily accurate, and in the middle of a conversation, sometimes it feels like her emotions change. “Maybe that’s why (people think it’s like having a girlfriend). Personally, that’s not the case for me.” Mystery also surrounds Rinna’s origin, with Microsoft refusing to confirm or deny that the computer giant is behind the program. The company’s logo and copyright mark is prominently displayed on Rinna’s setup page, while the first message a user receives introduces the character as being “operated by Microsoft Japan.” When contacted by The Japan Times on Thursday, however, Microsoft Japan said: “Nothing has been officially announced and so we are unable to make any comment.” When the same question was put to Rinna, the character replied with a picture of the Eiffel Tower and a love heart. Line Corp. was not immediately available for comment. In June, a “super computer” in London made headlines when it became the first machine to pass the “Turing Test,” duping humans into thinking it was a person. The test was devised by World War II codebreaker Alan Turing and requires 30 percent of human interrogators to mistakenly think that a computer is actually human during a series of short keyboard conversations. The computer program, named “Eugene Goostman,” fooled 33 percent of judges into thinking it was a 13-year-old boy. Twitter user Keznx believes Rinna could dupe people into thinking she is human. “It’s very subtle, but she uses slang words and phrases that only some people would know, and when you get an answer like that it’s really interesting,” he said. “I think that will be further refined from now on and I’m looking forward to it.”",

    "source": "Japan backs next-generation 8K technology ahead of 2020 Games <eos> Besides its main focus on competitive sports, the Olympics also offer an opportunity to boost the host nation’s technology. Back in 1964 when Tokyo hosted its first Summer Games, color-TV sets were growing in popularity and eventually became a standard fixture in Japanese homes. Now as the nation gets ready to host the sports extravaganza again in 2020, it is trying to once again bring about a revolution in broadcasting, as both public and private sectors team up to introduce “made in Japan” 8K resolution imaging technology. However, amid the current trend of declining TV viewers, how much of an impact will the technology have on society? The Japan Times has taken a closer look at 8K resolution technology to offer a glimpse into post-Olympics society and the “ultimate” TV display. What is 8K and how does it differ from conventional displays? The 8K resolution display, or Super Hi-Vision (SHV), is a next-generation technology that is expected to succeed 4K, or ultra-high definition resolution, which most TV manufacturers offer. The term 8K derives from the letter “K,” which stands for 1,000 in the binary numeration system commonly used in the computer industry. SHV technology boasts a resolution of 7,680 pixels horizontally by 4,320 pixels vertically, or 16 times as many pixels as the standard high-definition displays, which have a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. The higher the resolution, the sharper, deeper and smoother the moving images. The 8K display imagery is said to be equivalent to 4.3 in human eyesight in terms of visual acuity, and experts say it can be regarded as “the ultimate 2D display,” as it enables viewers to see moving images without recognizing pixels even on a large screen. The sense of realness one can get from 8K display “won’t be upgraded any further even if there were such technologies as 16K or 32K,” said Yoshihiro Fujita, professor of broadcasting technology at Ehime University and a former vice manager of NHK’s Science and Technology Research Laboratories who has been involved in the development of 8K technology since the project began in 1995. How has development of 8K technology progressed? The development of 8K resolution technology is near completion, and developers are now moving toward introducing the technology to consumers. In 2012, during the London Olympic and Paralympic Games, NHK and BBC jointly conducted the world’s first experimental public viewing using 8K broadcasting technology. Under the government’s scheme, experimental 8K broadcasting is expected to begin in Japan as early as next year with a limited number of channels on satellite broadcasts. Broadcasting to the public is likely to start by 2018, involving more satellite broadcasters. The telecommunications ministry hopes a majority of people in Japan will be able to watch the 2020 Tokyo Olympics either at home or at public venues, tapping the breathtakingly beautiful image quality of 4K and 8K displays. Is 8K just about watching clearer images on TV and large screens? If it is just an extension of current TV technology, it may not be worth the investment. But the detailed, vibrantly-colored display technology can be applicable to other areas to advance the post-Olympics society. Perhaps the most appreciable benefit other than broadcasting is for medical use, as the superhuman clarity of 8K resolution can make possible surgeries that were not possible before. For example, an 8K resolution endoscopic camera may allow doctors to perform operations using extra-fine sutures — currently visible only through a microscope — to avoid damaging narrowed blood vessels. The 8K resolution’s color-rich images also allow doctors to identify cancer cells at an extremely early stage by observing even the slightest differences between normal tissues and cancerous tissues that cannot be detected with HD resolution. As images recorded with an 8K camera can be seen clearly even when zooming in, the technology can also serve security roles, as well as scientific research, education and visual arts. Are there any obstacles to introducing the technology? The equipment needed to offer 8K viewing is extravagant and expensive and may not be the first choice for consumers. Such resolution is said to require a screen bigger than 80 inches to display the finest quality images. Ordinary households in Japan may have a hard time accommodating such large equipment. The price of 8K displays may run between ¥4 million and ¥5 million when they debut on the market, said Yasushi Anzo, a journalist versed in IT and household electronics. Because of these obstacles, Anzo said it’s more realistic to suggest that, by the 2020 Olympics,8K displays will be installed at public viewing venues to let many people experience the technology, rather than for home use. Despite the difficulties, why is Japan set on developing 8K technology? Japan seeks to reclaim its title as the world’s electronics leader by pushing 8K technology. Using the 2020 Games as an opportunity to advertise Japan-made technology globally, “Japan is aiming to sell the broadcasting technology overseas” to regain its share in the international global electronics market, Anzo said. The 8K technology is also the key for Japanese electronics makers to recover their reputation by showcasing their potential for technological development to the world, Anzo said. “Even if the already-struggling TV display departments of Japanese electronics makers go even deeper into deficit by developing 8K displays, they cannot cut it off immediately” because they must maintain their presence as producers of cutting-edge innovation, he said.",

    "source": "Chinese shoppers keep Japan's tills ringing <eos> According to the English-language Japan news site RocketNews 24, a few weeks ago two families got into a fight at a large retail outlet in Kobe over disposable diapers. Both families had come to the store when it opened in order to buy as many diapers as they could, only to discover that the store had already sold out. Apparently these two families knew each other from previous diaper-buying binges and harbored mutual resentments that turned physical. A store employee called the police, who broke up the fight. Neither party filed a complaint or disclosed what the argument was about. RocketNews speculates that the two families resell the diapers in China, since both have members who are Chinese nationals. Japanese diapers are particularly popular in China, and, in fact, this particular brand — Merries, made by Kao — is sold in China. Nevertheless, there’s obviously enough demand to support a lucrative resale market. It’s not as if the Chinese don’t make and sell their own disposable diapers, but when it comes to their children, consumers will pay a premium for Japanese products because they don’t trust domestic makers. This sensibility has been growing since 2008, when locally made baby formula caused the deaths of six children and sent thousands to the hospital after somebody adulterated it with melamine to make it seem as if the protein content was higher. It is illegal to import Japanese formula made in certain prefectures because of radiation fears, but apparently there’s substantial black-market trade in the product. Last month, 425 kg of smuggled formula made in Gunma Prefecture was discovered by authorities in Hunan province with an estimated retail value of ¥800,000. It’s often said that despite the diplomatic frictions that exist between Japan and China, they are dependent on each other economically and, as far as Japan’s dependence goes, it is very much influenced by Chinese consumers’ trust of Japanese products, which runs pretty deep. Some economists thought that China’s stock market plunge and the resulting government-approved devaluation of the yuan would hurt sales of Japanese goods both in China and in Japan, where Chinese tourists seem to be supporting the Japanese economy. But according to Luo Yiwen, the president of home electronics retailer Laox, speaking at an Aug. 13 news conference, the stock and currency issues aren’t having any negative effect on sales at his store’s duty-free shop, which caters mainly to Chinese visitors. As it stands, sales for January to June at the shop have more than doubled since the same period in 2014 to ¥45 billion, with profits increasing nearly eightyfold to ¥4.6 billion. Laox received 1.49 million Chinese customers last year, four times the number for the previous year, and “much more than we expected,” he said. He predicts not only that the devaluation of the yuan will not hurt sales, but that they’ll go up even more. He projects a net profit this year of ¥8.3 billion on sales of ¥90 billion. The two reasons for the strong Chinese tourist market are the lower yen and fewer visa restrictions for Chinese tourists. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun cites a third reason: more cheap flights between China and Japan thanks to the proliferation of low-cost carriers. The economic value of Chinese tourism in Japan bottomed out in 2011 at ¥813 billion due to the March 11 disaster, but rebounded to ¥1.8 trillion the next year. In 2014 the economic value was ¥2.3 trillion. In that year, 2.4 million Chinese came to Japan, which is actually less than the number of visitors from Taiwan, which was 2.8 million. The difference is that per person, the Chinese spent more: ¥231,000 compared to ¥125,000 for the Taiwanese and ¥147,000 for visitors from Hong Kong, who are counted separately from mainlanders. In fact, Chinese account for one-third of all the tourist money spent in Japan, and this figure is rising. The amount of money Chinese visitors spent increased by 83 percent from 2013 to 2014. More to the point, 55 percent of the money Chinese spend in Japan is for shopping. For all tourists, the average spent on shopping is 35 percent. In contrast, Chinese spend less on accommodation than visitors from other countries, which suggests they are more concerned with buying stuff than sightseeing. Also, according to a Tourism Agency survey cited in the Nikkei, it isn’t just rich Chinese who are spending. More middle-class Chinese are coming and buying things. Broken down by category, the agency says that 76 percent of Chinese buy “confections,” 63 percent cosmetics and perfume, 55 percent food, liquor and cigarettes, and 52 percent drugs and toiletries. Only 37 percent buy appliances, but when they buy them, they buy a lot. The average spent by all foreign tourists on electronics is ¥65,000. Chinese on average spend ¥88,000. Chinese tourists, in fact, seem to be single-handedly keeping Japanese department stores in business. Although airport duty-free shops are the main venue for Chinese purchases followed by “shopping centers,” department stores that offer tariff-free sales to foreigners are a strong third and, according to the Nikkei, the reason is that they know the designer brands they buy in department stores are “authentic,” meaning not knock-offs. (For what it’s worth, both real designer goods and their fake counterparts tend to be made in China.) And if it seems unwise to purchase such goods in department stores, which tend to charge more, they’re likely still cheaper than those bought in China, which may be subject to tariffs.",

    "source": "As Hashimoto's reign nears end, a divisive legacy remains <eos> OSAKA - Assuming he does not once again change his mind and seek re-election, the curtain on Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto’s local political career falls on Nov. 22, when voters elect a new mayor and governor. The two local races are, first and foremost, a test of whether the Hashimoto-led “Ishin” movement has the capacity to continue both at the local and national levels. The Osaka Ishin no Kai (One Osaka) local party holds pluralities in the Osaka Municipal and Prefectural assemblies, while Ishin no To (Japan Innovation Party), which Hashimoto and Osaka Gov. Ichiro Matsui helped launch, is a major opposition force in the Diet. But the two races are also expected to test the relationship between the local chapters of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and coalition partner Komeito and the two party’s respective national headquarters. Differences over how to handle the May Osaka referendum issue on merging administrative entities within the city of Osaka created interparty tensions within the ruling bloc. Despite calls to run again, Hashimoto has remained adamant that it’s time for someone else to continue the “Hashimoto Revolution” in Osaka. The so-called revolution began in 2008 with his election as governor and, for all practical purposes, ended in May when he and his partner, Matsui, saw their efforts to administratively merge the city of Osaka with its namesake prefecture fail — just barely — in the referendum. Since that vote, which the anti-merger, anti-Hashimoto camp won by just over 10,000 votes, speculation as to who from Osaka Ishin would emerge as the successor candidate in November has been growing. Meanwhile, anti-Hashimoto forces, led by the local chapters of the LDP, Komeito, the Japanese Communist Party and the Democratic Party of Japan, are seeking to ensure that when Hashimoto and Matsui leave office, the governor and mayoral seats are returned to someone with connections to an established political party. For Osaka Ishin, various potential candidates have been debated in media circles, some only half seriously. The mayor, a former television commentator, himself suggested earlier this month that TV celebrity Kenji Tamura should stand for mayor, and that Yoshimoto Kogyo talent Koji Higashino should run for governor. While the suggestion was widely seen as a joke, Osaka Ishin members are concerned that without a charismatic, media-savvy candidate who is well-known to Osaka voters, they could lose. While Hashimoto was likely joking about Higashino and Tamura, it’s less clear if he was being facetious when he suggested Matsui as a good choice for mayor. At an Osaka Ishin meeting just before the Bon holidays in mid-August, a number of party members supported the idea of a Matsui candidacy, assuming that a suitable candidate, perhaps even a current Osaka-based Ishin no To Diet member, could be found to run for governor. “I think Matsui would be a great choice to carry on the goals of Osaka Ishin,” Hashimoto said. That would also allow Hashimoto to concentrate his attention on a planned new national political party consisting only of Diet members from the Kansai region, dubbed the “Kansai Ishin no To.” The party, expected to be formally launched in the coming weeks, will likely consist only of local assembly and Diet members from the six prefectures of the Kansai area. Matsui, however, is reportedly interested in running for an Upper House seat in next summer’s election. After that, the picture becomes less clear. Friends of Hashimoto who work in local television, either as comedians or as newscasters, have previously turned down calls from Hashimoto to run for office. None has indicated a change of heart in terms of running in the November elections. Meanwhile, the established parties that oppose Hashimoto and his merger plans — especially the local LDP and Komeito chapters — are hunting for a candidate who can be effective against Osaka Ishin’s legislative strength. That’s likely to prove difficult since Osaka Ishin still controls 36 of the 86 municipal assembly seats and 43 of the 88 prefectural assembly seats. Without the cooperation of all the opposition parties, the formation of a majority to block Osaka Ishin’s proposals is impossible. Yet as the referendum campaign showed, even the LDP and JCP — or at least their local chapters — will cooperate if it means stopping Hashimoto. To the consternation of their Tokyo-based party members, Osaka-based representatives from the LDP, Komeito, JCP and the DPJ even appeared together at public rallies and on TV to oppose the merger plan. Whether that kind of cooperation among such disparate parties will be seen again prior to the November elections is questionable. Some LDP Osaka chapter members weren’t happy about being seen in public with their DPJ and JCP rivals — with many afraid of upsetting local business interests that backed the merger or fearful of angering party headquarters and jeopardizing their political futures. For the mayor’s position, the LDP’s Osaka chapter is discussing municipal assembly member Akira Yanagimoto as its candidate. He has indicated he would be interested if the atmosphere were right. The 41-year-old Yanagimoto, who represents the city’s Nishinari day-laborer district, was the public face of the merger opposition last spring, going head-to-head against Hashimoto in numerous television debates. He’s a former Kansai Electric Power Co. employee and the nephew of LDP Upper House member Takuji Yanagimoto, a particularly strong advocate for a new Constitution that protects privacy and environmental rights. For governor, the current mayor of Sakai, Osami Takeyama, also a strong Hashimoto opponent, has been mentioned by some local TV pundits, although he is reportedly uninterested. “Yanagimoto and Takeyama are both good local politicians. But it’s unclear whether they’d be able to work well with Osaka Ishin or even some of the other opposition parties,” one prefectural opposition party member said on condition of anonymity. “Regardless, no matter what happens in November, some very serious compromises are going to have to be made by local leaders and all political parties in order to prevent the kind of gridlock Osaka has seen this past year.” The push by all parties to formally tap candidates is likely to pick up steam next month, especially if Hashimoto’s new “Kansai no To” party becomes reality by mid-September. Whoever ends up filling the shoes as mayor and governor will have two of the toughest jobs in local politics: guiding a city and prefecture still split, especially among assemblies, between embittered pro- and anti-Hashimoto forces to a new era for the city and the Kansai region.",

    "source": "Top-heavy, nuke-clinging Kepco faces liberated electricity market <eos> OSAKA - News that 7-Eleven stores in the Kansai region will trade Kansai Electric Power Co.’s electricity in favor of cheaper electricity from Tokyo Electric Power Co. has locals wondering if Kepco’s six-decade monopoly over Kansai’s electricity supply might be ending. From October, about 1,000 Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd. stores in three Kansai prefectures will purchase their electricity from Tepco. The move comes just months after Kepco raised rates, and Seven-Eleven Japan, noting Tepco’s cheaper fees, made the move to switch utilities. Stores in Nara, Wakayama and Hyogo prefectures will receive 32,000 kw of Tepco-provided electricity from a self-generator at the utility’s Kansai factory. That’s enough to power about 10,000 homes. For Seven-Eleven Japan, switching to Tepco means reduced electricity costs amounting to hundreds of millions of yen. With deregulation in the smaller users electricity market set to begin next April, giving small businesses and residential customers a wider option of providers, Kepco seems particularly ill-placed to take advantage of the new competitive environment. Prior to 2011, Kepco relied on nuclear power for up to half of its total electricity supply — the highest ratio of any utility in Japan. Because all 11 of its reactors remain idle, though two will be decommissioned, Kepco says it was forced to hike electricity rates in June to make up for lost revenues. But a host of critics, starting with Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, have also noted that Kepco has done little to reduce its top-heavy management structure, especially the number of senior executives, all of whom command huge salaries and bonuses. Adding to investor concerns is the fact that scare stories about how blackouts will occur without Kepco-provided nuclear power no longer resonate with the public. Thanks to a combination of voluntary reductions in electricity usage and ever more energy efficient technology, Japan as a whole is consuming over 10 percent less electricity now compared to 2010. Even during the first week of August, when air conditioners were running full blast and temperatures topped 35 degrees, Kepco had plenty of electricity to sell, with demand under 90 percent, and as low as 80 percent, of available supply. Nowadays, Kepco has changed tactics, and says the only way it can compete against Tepco and new electricity providers is to restart its nuclear plants so it can offer lower prices. But increased competition due to deregulatory measures, the introduction of more energy-efficient technologies like LED lighting, and shifting electricity consumption habits these past four years means Kepco will have to fight a lot harder to keep its old customers — let alone find new ones — in the coming years.",

    "source": "Psychology is where real radiation risks lie <eos> Misinformation breeds discrimination. As if it wasn’t enough to experience the trauma of a nuclear bomb, many hibakusha (atomic bomb survivors) also faced appalling discrimination. It appears their children and grandchildren still do — as do those who were caught up in the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear disaster in 2011. Problems arise because the general public is not properly informed about radiation. Stories in newspapers often exaggerate the risks and fears surrounding radiation, as do lobby groups opposed to nuclear energy. I’ve been thinking about this when reading some of the first-hand accounts of nuclear war from surviving hibakusha. Shimako Yamaguchi, 94, recounted her memories of the Nagasaki bomb to the Asahi Shimbun. She’s been plagued by nightmares about the dying people she had to leave behind. Crawling across a bridge covered in bodies on the morning of Aug. 9, 1945, she had to free herself from a hand that grasped her ankle. Sometimes, guilt-ridden, she still feels the grip of that hand. However, she said, throughout her life she’s been called a marugen (“nukey”), even in hospitals when she’s gone for checkups. Hiroshima resident Shizuoka Abe, 18 at the time of the bomb and now 88, told the British Broadcasting Corp. that her children were bullied. They were called “A-bomb children” and faced discrimination. Perhaps even more troubling, misinformation may still cause discrimination, fear and suffering today. I heard from a friend of a friend in Hiroshima, a granddaughter of a hibakusha, that she was afraid to have children in case they had genetic problems. I was shocked by this — the woman herself is fine but she was still worried about her genes. She should not be concerned. Several studies have shown that the children and grandchildren of hibakusha do not have any increased risk of genetic problems. It’s horrifying that people should still be worried about this; the general public should be reassured that they are OK. In a paper published earlier this month in The Lancet medical journal, professor Kenji Kamiya of Hiroshima University and colleagues reported on the long-term health impact of radiation exposure from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Kamiya’s team looked at evidence from a life span study that followed 94,000 atomic bomb survivors from 1950 (five years after the bombings) to the current day. Yes, they found that survivors of the bombs face an increased lifetime risk of cancer. The risk was found to be proportional to dose for “solid cancers” — all cancers other than leukemia — and people exposed as children had a higher risk. However, hereditary effects have not been detected. In other words, the children of hibakusha are not at any greater risk of developing cancer during their lives. In a 2003 study conducted by Dale Preston of Hirosoft International Corp., researchers found that hibakusha had a 10.7 percent greater risk of developing a solid cancer than other Japanese who were not exposed to radiation. In addition, the Radiation Effects Research Foundation found that a person who receives a whole-body dose of radiation will carry a cancer risk that is less than five times that of an unexposed individual. It is uncontroversial to conclude, therefore, that the psychological effects of radiation exposure may be worse than the actual physiological effects. Certainly, the psychological stigma seems to have been worse for a number of descendants of hibakusha and for people living near the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Koichi Tanigawa of Fukushima Medical University agrees that the worst outcome of the disaster was the psychological problems it caused. “Although the radiation dose to the public from Fukushima was relatively low, and no discernible physical health effects are expected, psychological and social problems, largely stemming from the differences in risk perceptions, have had a devastating impact on people’s lives,” Tanigawa wrote in findings published in The Lancet. Tanigawa’s colleague, Akira Ohtsuru, also at Fukushima Medical University, has also published a paper that addresses concerns about mental health in the wake of a nuclear accident. “One of the key tasks of the health services is to reliably communicate that in most nuclear accidents very few people are exposed to a life-threatening dose of radiation,” Ohtsuru wrote. He also wrote that “screening for mental illness in residents relocated from their homes and providing mental health care will be essential.” It’s not really surprising that the obvious physical effects of radiation exposure are the ones that doctors have focused on over the years. First the immediate effects of exposure to radiation, then the potential increased risk of cancer. Radiation is invisible and that’s one of the reasons it is so feared. However, the psychological effects of exposure — even of small, harmless amounts — are hard to see, too. Even reading the accounts of the hibakusha can be harrowing. Nothing most of us have experienced comes close. It is vital that their stories are told so people never forget what they went through. We can now, in the month of the 70th anniversary of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, at least acknowledge the psychological burden carried by those caught up in nuclear accidents — especially those living around Fukushima — to make their internal suffering visible. This is the conclusion of Kamiya’s paper. “Psychosocial problems in Fukushima have a devastating effect on people’s lives,” he wrote. “In addition to the natural science of radiation effects, psychosocial studies should be integrated into recovery planning after nuclear accidents such as that at Fukushima.”",

    "source": "The fraught debate over science and divinity <eos> Truth is a sordid business. It brings nations down to earth, cuts people down to size. Why honor it, therefore? Why esteem it above myth, which does the opposite, raising nations to the gods and turning ordinary, unremarkable people into subjects of divine rulers? Japan, the ancient chronicles tell us, is “the land of the gods,” its emperors descended from the Sun Goddess. Pre-rational thinking spawns beliefs a lot more fantastic than that. Is it surprising that this one went so long unquestioned? Prince among early skeptics was Confucius (551-479 B.C.). Asked by a disciple how best to serve the gods, he replied, “You are not even able to serve man. How can you serve the spirits?” Keep your thoughts earthbound, he seems to be saying; they’ll be busy enough. Confucianism in Japan goes back to the seventh-century, coming of age a millennium later as the official ideology of the Tokugawa shoguns. Absolute rulers from 1603 to 1867, the Tokugawas found Confucian downplaying of the divine a convenient cover for their effective sidelining of the divine Emperor. Confucianist Arai Hakuseki (1657-1725) spoke in the master’s prosaic spirit when he said, “The kami (gods) are human beings. … And when the kami Izanagi and Izanami are said to have had intercourse and produced the islands of Japan, this refers to a merging of two great fleets of warships led by these personages.” The Meiji Restoration of 1868 toppled the Tokugawas and hurled feudal, stagnant, isolated, backward Japan forward into the modern world. This was a revolution — carried out in the name of the 15-year-old Emperor Meiji, “restored” not to power but to immaculate, powerless, sacredness. Out with Confucianism. Japan once again was “the land of the gods,” and the shrewd politicians who ruled in the Emperor’s name intended to keep it that way. The intellectual dilemma this determination encompassed emerged only gradually. Science and myth are fundamentally incompatible. A regime seeking to wield both — science to build “a rich nation and a strong army,” myth to foster popular enthusiasm and unquestioning obedience — walks a very tricky tightrope. Science meant education in the positivist mode — unfettered curiosity, methodical observation, objective reasoning. European and American professors were recruited to staff new universities, Tokyo Imperial University, the future University of Tokyo, among them. Scientific history was largely a German development. Among its early exponents was Ludwig Riess (1861-1928), who taught at Tokyo Imperial University for three years beginning in 1887. Riess articulated the spirit of the new age: “All historical subjects and problems are capable and in need of scientific treatment.” Riess setting the tone, Japanese colleagues eagerly followed. Most famous among them was Kunitake Kume (1839-1931). Decorated and feted, he suffered an abrupt downfall. In 1892, he resigned in disgrace. What had he done? How had he offended? He had said — as Arai and other Tokugawa thinkers had two centuries earlier — that Japan’s gods were mythical, not historical; that the native Shinto religion was a primitive form of worship, relic of bygone times. As for the “way of the gods,” what nation doesn’t have its way of the gods? “The way of the gods is worldwide,” said Kume; “religion itself is the way of the gods.” The Meiji government was honest at least to the extent of being forthright about its conservative aims. There was no humbugging lip service to individual freedom, human rights, democracy. “In the administration of all schools,” declared Education Minister Arinori Mori (shortly before his assassination in 1889 by a Shintoist zealot), “it must be kept in mind that what is done is not for the sake of the pupils but for the sake of the country.” Imperial universities in Meiji Japan were government departments; professors were civil servants. Kume, clearly, was a man of considerable courage. Mori’s assassination made the risks he ran only too plain; dismissal was one of the lesser ones, and he remained admirably firm when political thugs known as soshi visited his home uninvited and harangued him for hours. Years later, having to some extent resuscitated his academic career at the private Waseda University, he recalled: “We three professors, (Yasutsugu) Shigeno, (Hisashi) Hoshino and myself, who started the Department of Japanese History, were all considered bad. I was the most hated of the three, and … when I expressed myself too lightly in the matter of Shinto, I had to resign the prestigious position of professor at the Imperial University. Looking back, I would say that I was a victim of the merger of Japan and Korea.” That vexed question did not involve him personally, but the axe fell on him as the most radical, or perhaps simply the most reckless, of the three trailblazing disciples of Riess. Shigeno — as historian John Brownlee explains in his book “Japanese Historians and the National Myths, 1600-1945” — was known as “Dr. Obliteration” for the doubts he cast on the existence of this or that character of myth or pseudo-history. Hoshino evolved a hypothesis that assigned Korean origin to the god Oshimimi, a child of Amaterasu Omikami, the Sun Goddess and ancestress of the Imperial line. The supposed ancient union of Japan and Korea gave Japan its excuse to annex Korea in 1910, but 20 years earlier it was a touchy subject. Shigeno and Hoshino, more politically adroit apparently than Kume — their failure to speak out in Kume’s defense suggests as much — were spared, though Shigeno’s works were censored posthumously amid the nationalist hysteria of the 1930s. In 1911, a vague plot to assassinate Emperor Meiji was summarily dealt with by a mass roundup of political dissidents, 12 of whom were hanged. See what unorthodox teaching leads to, people said. “Scientific history” was amoral, corrosive. “History,” Brownlee quotes the contemporary scholar Shuji Isawa as asserting, “must be centered primarily on moral education that makes clear the right relations between the Emperor and his subjects” — the former divine, the latter worshipful. “That is not open to question.”",

    "source": "Five ex-prime ministers rap Abe over his push for security bills <eos> Five former prime ministers harshly criticized current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over his push for security bills that would greatly expand the role of the Self-Defense Forces overseas, according to their statements collected by a group of former journalists. The group of about 50 former reporters for newspaper publishers and TV stations said it received written recommendations from five former prime ministers — Morihiro Hosokawa, Tsutomu Hata, Tomiichi Murayama, Yukio Hatoyama and Naoto Kan — after asking 12 former prime ministers in writing in July to give advice to Abe. Abe’s Cabinet in May approved the security bills that would allow Japan to exercise the right to collective self-defense, or coming to the aid of the United States or other friendly nations under armed attack even if Japan itself is not attacked. The bills are now in the upper chamber of the Diet after the ruling parties pushed them through the Lower House last month despite mounting public opposition and questions over the legislation’s consistency with the pacifist Constitution. Kan, who served as prime minister from June 2010 to September 2011, said in a statement that Abe “is against constitutionalism and unqualified as a prime minister of a democratic country. … I request his resignation.” Hosokawa, who led Japan from August 1993 to April 1994, called for scrapping of the security bills. “If the security bills are passed, it would mean the collapse of constitutionalism and damage national interests,” he said. Hata, who took the helm for about two months after Hosokawa’s term, said, “The spirit of the pacifist Constitution laid the foundation for peace and prosperity today … let’s protect Japan from Prime Minister Abe.” Murayama, who served as prime minister from June 1994 to January 1996, criticized Abe for pushing through parliament the controversial bills despite mounting public concerns as seen in demonstrations and opinion polls. He said Abe’s attitude of pushing the bills through by “neglecting people’s voices” is “unforgivable.” Hatoyama, whose term lasted about nine months from September 2009, said, “I request the prime minister to make a wise decision to shift from ‘nation-building toward war’ to ‘nation-building for peace.'” Konosuke Oharu, 79, a former reporter for NHK, said at a press conference in Tokyo on Tuesday that the statements written by former prime ministers share the same values to respect the Constitution and the belief that politics should be done under the Constitution. “Citizens are aware that Prime Minister Abe is trying to destroy (the shared values),” said Oharu, a member of the former journalists’ group. The group did not receive statements from such long-serving prime ministers as Yasuhiro Nakasone and Junichiro Koizumi.",

    "source": "The biggest terrorism threat in Japan <eos> Remember how the government said Japan needed a state secrets law to protect it from acts of terrorism? Which is more dangerous: a government bureaucrat, a journalist or a worker in a nuclear power plant that may be crazy or a criminal? Answer: anyone but the nuclear power plant worker. The Japan Federation of Bar Associations says that all government workers and sub-contractors will face invasive security checks from now on because almost all government agencies are handling documents that are categorized as state secrets. The security checks will examine a person’s criminal and disciplinary records, improper conduct in handling information, drug abuse, pyschological disorders, “moderation in drinking alcohol,” and an assessment of their credit history and financial situation. Guess who won’t be subject to such checks? Workers at the country’s nuclear power plants and storage facilities, at least according to a recent report in the Sankei Shimbun. Tokyo Electric Power Co. and other utilities may ask potential employees to complete a self-assessment report and conduct a background check based on the results, but they are not obliged to do so. The law now requires power companies to take anti-terrorism measures to protect against external threats but there is no requirement to establish countermeasures against threats on the inside. In other words, the simplest way for a terrorist to gain entry into a nuclear power plant remains the same: apply for a job. An NRA official told me that power utilities may even turn a blind eye to background checks that revealed former ties to yakuza members and other undesirables because it could create a staffing shortage. The transparency of the country’s nuclear industry is an issue that has been debated ever since the triple-meltdown disaster at the Fukushima No. 1 power plant in 2011. In August 2013, Reporters Without Borders welcomed a decision by Shiro Shirakawa, head of nuclear power safety company New Tech, to withdraw a libel suit against freelance journalist Minoru Tanaka. The subject of the lawsuit was a Shukan Kinyobi article published in December 2011 that was titled “Last big fixer, Shiro Shirakawa, gets his share of the Tepco nuclear cake.” The article suggests that Shirakawa profited from acting as an intermediary between Tepco, construction companies, politicians and even criminal elements. New Tech oversaw security for the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Rokkasho, Aomori Prefecture, where there’s enough plutonium to make hundreds of nuclear weapons, according to the Center For Public Integrity. In short, we’ve been asked to believe that power companies are able to handle the safety and security of nuclear facilities around the country without any government oversight. These, of course, are the same utilities that were managing nuclear plants in Fukushima, Niigata and Ibaraki prefectures when they were struck by accidents that led to radioactive leaks and/or fatalities. It might be different if any negligence is followed up by criminal penalties, but I suspect this is unlikely. The Prosecutor’s Office has so far declined to file criminal charges against anyone at Tepco over allegations of negligence that have surfaced in the wake of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Two workers did drown while checking the status of generators located in the basement of the No. 4 reactor building after it had been swamped by the waves. The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission found the nuclear disaster was a “profoundly manmade disaster that … should have been foreseen and prevented.” Although no deaths followed short-term radiation exposure immediately after the quake, researchers from Fukushima Medical University found that more than 50 children in the area have developed thyroid cancer since the accident. Masao Yoshida, chief of the plant during the crisis, might have been able to provide evidence to prosecutors but he died of esophageal cancer in July 2013. The rapid spread of the disease following diagnosis allowed Tepco to say it was unrelated to the nuclear accident. In July 2103, a judicial panel of citizens recommended that three former Tepco executives should be prosecuted over the nuclear disaster. The report prompted the Prosecutor’s Office to resume investigations but ultimately decided not to indict anyone over the crisis, leaking the decision on the day Tokyo was awarded the 2020 Olympics and, effectively, burying the story. In future, the state secrets law is likely to make such news even easier to hide. So why it was necessary to draft secrecy legislation in the first place? “Let me assure you the situation is under control,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in a speech to the International Olympic Committee in Buenos Aires on Sept. 7, 2013, referring to contaminated groundwater problems at the site of the disaster. Tokyo was awarded the 2020 Games after the presentation. Six days later, Kazuhiko Yamashita, a senior executive at Tepco, disputed Abe’s claim during a meeting in Koriyama, Fukushima Prefecture. “We regard the current situation as not being under control,” Yamashita said. A few months later, the state secrets bill was bulldozed through the Diet. All of this makes me think the secrecy law hasn’t been drafted to fight terrorism, it’s been created to ensure things are under control — not so much the nuclear problem, but how the media report on the nuclear problem. While Fukushima may not be under control, the media certainly is. Abe now claims his resounding election victory has given him a mandate to restart the nuclear reactors. Meanwhile, media outlets nationwide are now no longer able to report on security surrounding the plants and may not even be told how much radioactive waste is still leaking into the ocean. It’s arguable the glowing look on Abe’s face after winning an election in which a little more than 50 percent of the population voted has less to do with the size of his victory and more to do with the fact that he no longer has to face difficult questions he feels uncomfortable with. Take, for example, the way he removed his earpiece when talking to journalists in a live interview following his election victory — he seems perfectly happy not listening. If, God forbid, someday another nuclear meltdown warning siren goes off, will he hear it? And if he does, will he tell us?",

    "source": "Debate over WW1 role; 21 Nazis snatched off Yokohama; new Red China policy adopted; Nagasaki mayor shot <eos> 100 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Jan. 26, 1915 Debate over role in European conflict Amid many rumors and arguments about Japanese participation in the European war, two things are certain — namely, that Great Britain does not like it, and that Japan is ready to participate the moment its ally requests it. German diplomacy is doing what it can to prevent the participation. Japanese participation, says a high official, would have political as well as military significance, as it will persuade Italy and Rumania to join the Allies. The new British troops to arrive on the battlefield this spring will be hardly sufficient in number to drive the enemy out of Belgium and France. It seems to be Japan’s plan, characteristic of an Oriental nation, to offer participation on certain conditions when a real crisis has come for the Allies. These conditions will include the grant of favorable terms when Japan wishes to float loans in Great Britain or France, and the recognition of her commercial privileges in China. It is reported in other circles that Germany, anxious to get Japan to betray her allies, has offered her a free hand in Asia while she herself and Austria are engaged in the conquest of Africa. Japan’s contribution to the European war was ultimately limited to naval operations. 75 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Jan. 23, 1940 Cruiser snatches 21 Nazis off Yokohama Twenty-one German merchant marine officers were prisoners of war aboard a British cruiser Monday, following a drama on the high seas which brought Japan a taste of the European conflict. The men were forcibly taken from the N.Y.K. Liner Asama Maru noon Sunday about 50 miles off Nojimazaki Point at the entrance of Tokyo Bay by a boarding party of British officers and men. The Asama Maru, bound from Los Angeles to Yokohama, was stopped by the cruiser which fired a shot across the Japanese vessel’s bow. The British Embassy in Tokyo issued a statement confirming the raid and emphasizing that it was in full accord with wartime international law. Captain K. Watanabe of the Asama Maru strenuously objected to seizure of the German sailors, according to Purser Hideyoshi Nanjo. The name of the British cruiser was not learned but it was a 10,000 tonner of the “A” class. The sailors taken were en route to Germany via Japan and Russia. They had been in service on oil tankers out of Panama and, when war flared over Europe, were taken off the ships for transfer to Germany. A passenger on the liner told The Japan Times the cruiser appeared off the Asama Maru’s port side Sunday about 12:40 p.m. and fired a blank shot across the Asama’s bow. The Asama hove to and a launch, bearing four officers and 16 men in uniform, put out from the cruiser and came alongside. The British officers had a list of the 51 Germans on board, but took only 21 men as being members of Germany’s armed forces. Two German sailors succeeded in hiding while the vessel was searched and escaped capture. They refused to give their names when the boat docked at Yokohama. The Asama passenger told The Japan Times: “When the cruiser first appeared all the passengers, even the Germans, thought it was a Japanese cruiser and they got out their cameras. Then the cruiser ran up the British flag and the Germans became worried.” According to one of the German sailors who evaded capture, 400 German sailors were taken off Standard Oil tankers at outbreak of the war and kept four months in New York City. In December, 41 of them were sent to Los Angeles where they boarded the Asama Maru. “We thought we were safe, way out here in the Pacific,” he said ruefully, “but we were fooled.” 50 YEARS AGO Thursday, Jan. 21, 1965 Japan to adopt new Red China policy Prime Minister Eisaku Sato said Wednesday Japan would put forward an independent policy to deal with Communist China as a neighboring power. Sato made the statement at a press conference to report to the nation the results of his talks with President Lyndon B. Johnson and other American leaders in Washington last week. He said that the new policy on Communist China will be of “Japan’s own making and pursued independently.” The United States will not be allowed to interfere in its shaping or implementation, he said. Sato said his Government has as yet no plan for a direct official contact with Peiping authorities. He predicted, however, that trade between Japan and Communist China would be expanded greatly in the future. Sato, touching on the China question, said: “I pledged Japan’s continued normal ties with Nationalist China in the Washington talks. As for our relations with Peiping, I reaffirmed our policy of separating politics from economics. I believe it’s the best policy at the moment to maintain the status quo.” 25 YEARS AGO Friday, Jan. 19, 1990 Right-winger shoots Nagasaki mayor A member of a Nagasaki-based right-wing group was arrested Thursday evening following the shooting earlier in the day of Nagasaki Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima, police said. Motoshima was reported in stable condition Thursday night with a gunshot wound to his back. He caused controversy last year by saying the late Emperor Showa bore some responsibility for World War II. The mayor was shot in broad daylight outside Nagasaki City Hall. He was rushed to a hospital and was reported to be in a stable condition following a two-hour operation. Police said they arrested Kazumi Tajiri, 40, a member of the right-wing group Seikijuku, about five hours after the shooting.",

    "source": "Sexy China TV drama busted, returns to air more sedate <eos> BEIJING - A Chinese television drama that was pulled off the air after the female characters appeared on screen showing cleavage has returned to the screen, though this time showing only the actresses’ heads, state news agency Xinhua said on Saturday. The drama, “The Empress of China” also known as the “Saga of Wu Zetian,” was removed by commercial satellite station Hunan TV for “technical reasons” in late December, Xinhua said. “Many viewers speculated the suspension was a punishment given by the country’s television regulators for the much-discussed revealing costumes of female characters on the show, which stirred online debate in which the female characters were dubbed ‘squeezed breasts,’ ” Xinhua said. The move comes as the government, which is usually wary about political and sexual content, intensifies a crackdown on freedom of expression, both online and in traditional media. Chinese Internet users responded by complaining about the censorship on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. Several complained that they would not be able to see the hundreds of costume changes by Fan Bingbing, one of China’s most popular actresses, who plays the Empress Wu. Others questioned whether the low necklines had to be banned on television. “Can revealing cleavage really be considered pornographic?” wrote one microblogger. “Isn’t this feudalism?” Wu, the only recorded empress of China, ruled the country in the seventh century.",

    "source": "Obama to travel to drum up policy support as Republicans take over Congress <eos> WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama plans to travel around the U.S. as the newly Republican-controlled Congress arrives in Washington, promoting his policies from easing immigration rules to boosting the economy through spending on infrastructure. The president will begin a three-state swing on Wednesday in Detroit, then travel to Phoenix and Tennessee. He’ll announce a series of executive actions and legislative proposals that will help more people afford homes, pay for college and find work, according to a White House statement. The barnstorming is a buildup to Obama’s State of the Union address on Jan. 20, following his two-week Hawaiian vacation, in the face of a Congress that has its own agenda. The Republicans take control of both houses for the first time in Obama’s presidency on Tuesday, and will seek to put the president on the defensive by undoing his policies on issues ranging from immigration to health care. “The president is eager to get to work, and looks forward to working with the new Congress on policies that will make sure middle-class Americans are sharing in the economic recovery,” said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. “He will not let this Congress undo important protections gained — particularly in areas of health care, Wall Street reform and the environment.” Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the fact that Americans voted in favor of divided government shows they want “things done in the political center” that Republicans and Democrats agree on. Republicans’ legislative goals will include trying to “rein in the regulatory onslaught” and roll back elements of the Affordable Care Act, McConnell said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” program. Republicans lack the votes to repeal the health care law. The newly Republican Senate will challenge the president almost immediately — starting with a bill to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which has been delayed repeatedly by Obama’s administration and is in limbo pending a Nebraska court ruling. A Senate committee vote is set for Jan. 8. Democrats plan to add amendments to any bill approving Keystone to require that all oil going through the pipeline be used in the U.S. and that the pipeline itself be made out of domestic steel, U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer said Sunday. Democrats also have the votes to uphold a presidential veto of Keystone, he said. “Our Republican colleagues say that this is a jobs bill, but that really is not true at all,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in an interview on CBS’s “Face The Nation” program. “These amendments will make it better, but certainly not good enough at this point in time.” Republicans will also seek to to curb Obama’s energy and environmental regulations and block the president’s order easing deportation for undocumented immigrants. Republicans, who’ve held the majority in the House and now will have 54-46 control in the Senate, are more likely to support the president on the trade agreements he’s seeking with Europe and the Pacific nations. Obama returned to Washington Sunday after vacationing with his family on Oahu. During most of his days in Hawaii, he took time for a round of golf, often with friends he made growing up in the state. Since Republicans took control of both houses of Congress in the November election, Obama has signaled that he plans to take a tougher approach to dealing with political opponents. His speeches starting this week and the State of the Union address will be opportunities for the president to more clearly draw the distinctions between his priorities and those of the Republicans.",

    "source": "Stealth tech no given in Japanese sub deal <eos> Retired Vice Admiral Masao Kobayashi commanded Japan’s submarine fleet from 2007 to 2009. In a recent interview in Tokyo with The Japan Times, when asked to explain one of the country’s most tightly guarded military secrets, he seemed reflective. Kobayashi pointed to the ceiling lights in the quiet interview room and said: “Take those fluorescent lights, for example. Any fluorescent light generates sound.” Other than our voices, there were no other sounds in the room. “Fluorescent lights generate extremely small vibrations. We take anti-vibration measures for every single light in a submarine,” he said. Japan’s engineers have painstakingly worked to minimize the vibrations given off by the multitude of components in submarines to prevent even those undetectable by the human ear from being picked up by the super-sensitive sonars of enemy subs and sonobuoys from anti-submarine aircraft, Kobayashi said. Noisy components include fans, pumps, motors and fluorescent lights. Some are carefully muted with vibration-damping rubber, he said. “The quiet submarines we have today are the result of numerous long, patient efforts,” Kobayashi said. The Maritime Self-Defense Force’s submarines are not nuclear-powered but have a reputation for being ultra-quiet. Now Australia, seeking to build a new fleet of large, long-range submarines, seems keen on acquiring Japan’s latest Soryu-class subs, or at least their technology. If the deal goes through, the top-secret submarines will become the first major pieces of military hardware Japan has authorized for export since the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lifted the decades-long blanket ban on arms sales last year. Vice Adm. Robert Thomas, commander of the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet, reportedly said Oct. 24 in Tokyo that then-Australian Defense Minister David Johnston was very interested in Japan’s Soryu-class subs. “I talked to him about it four years ago and I said: ‘You want to find the finest diesel-electric submarine made on the planet — it’s made at Kobe works in Japan,’ Thomas was quoted as saying by Bloomberg News. The U.S., which has close but separate security pacts with Japan and Australia, probably wants Australia to buy Japanese submarines because it would greatly strengthen their strategic military ties, Kobayashi said. Deeper Japan-Australia military cooperation would help ease the heavy burden on the U.S. fleet, which is busy decommissioning many of the nuclear-powered attack submarines it built during the Cold War, he said. “The U.S. rapidly built many Los Angeles-class nuclear submarines during the Cold War. Many of them are being decommissioned now,” Kobayashi said. “I think the U.S. wants to create a strategic triangle of Japan, Australia and the United States. That’s probably a factor behind” the apparent U.S. nod to Australia’s proposal to Japan, he added. Japanese defense officials are thought to be pleased for the same reason Washington is. They want to deepen strategic military ties with Australia. “Australia would make a good partner for cooperation. There are no major diplomatic problems between the two countries other than whaling,” a senior Defense Ministry official said on condition anonymity. Australia opposes Japan’s annual whaling expeditions. Japan has just started receiving the submarine specifications sought by Australia but has yet to decide which secrets to share, two senior defense officials said. Japan soon plans to use lithium-ion batteries to drive the motors in its latest Soryu sub, making them even quieter. Australia is believed to be interested in this advance, the officials said. But advanced lithium-ion batteries are one of Japan’s top military secrets, one warned. “(Exporting) them would be a rather sensitive issue. We’d need to study if it’s really appropriate for an outside party (to have that technology),” the Defense Ministry official said. In Australia meanwhile, opposition lawmakers and trade unions are strongly opposed to procuring Japanese submarines because it could considerably undermine the domestic defense industry and reduce jobs in South Australia. Joint development might be an option, the two Japanese officials said, noting that nothing concrete has been officially proposed. Teruhiko Fukushima, a professor at the National Defense Academy in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, who is an expert on Australia, said Prime Minister Tony Abbott seems eager to procure the subs to bolster Canberra’s military ties with Japan and the United States. “Abbott should be considering a Japan-U.S.-Australian alliance as a kind of insurance” against the recent rise of China’s powerful military, Fukushima said. “The introduction of Soryu-class submarines would be a plus to strengthen that alliance,” he added. “If the Abbott administration survives the next election and wins a second term, there will be a greater chance that Soryu-class submarines will be introduced in Australia,” he said. Last June, Australia and Japan conducted “two-plus-two” talks between their foreign and defense ministers. In the joint statement that followed, Australia expressed “strong opposition to the use of force or coercion to unilaterally alter the status quo in the East China Sea and the South China Sea,” an apparent warning to China to not aggressively press its territorial claims in those areas, which include the Japan-controlled Senkaku Islands, which China and Taiwan also claim. China calls the uninhabited islets Diaoyu and Taiwan calls them Tiaoyutai. Fukushima also said that on Nov. 26, 2013, only three days after Beijing declared the establishment of an air defense identification zone over the East China Sea that included the Senkakus, the Abbott administration summoned the Chinese ambassador in Canberra to express its concerns after the ADIZ drew strong protests from Tokyo and Washington. “There is no doubt Abbott puts great emphasis on the relationship shared by Japan, the U.S. and Australia,” Fukushima said. But he also noted that China is Australia’s No. 1 trade partner and that the public would never approve of political actions that could seriously damage those economic ties. “The best way for Abbott is to strengthen the Japan-U.S.-Australian relationship while maintaining good economic ties with China at the same time. Australia would never turn its back on the Chinese market,” he said.",

    "source": "Reflections on the Kobe quake two decades on <eos> This year, thousands of Japanese around the country celebrated Coming-of-Age Day. In Kobe, however, the occasion was especially poignant, as those who will turn 20 this year were just days old or, most likely, born after the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake of Jan. 17, 1995. The first generation of adults who never experienced the event firsthand has officially arrived. For those of us who lived through the quake, it remains one of the defining moments of our lives. The experience changed the way we saw Kobe, the Kansai region, and Japan itself. Like the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, it demolished official lies that had become articles of faith. Two of these fallacies were: Japanese construction is quake-proof, and the central government will assist in a timely manner if disaster strikes. Both beliefs crumbled quicker than the Hanshin Expressway. In particular, Tokyo bureaucrats and politicians who could not respond quickly, and the 1,001 anecdotes of asinine behavior when they did, in Kobe and Kansai created deep resentments and a skepticism — even cynicism — of government that still lingers. However, the Kobe quake also awoke a spirit of volunteerism that continues today. Whatever the logistical and bureaucratic problems of responding to 3/11, without the experience of the Kobe quake, things would have been far worse. Knowledge gained and friendships forged in the rubble of Kobe in 1995 endured, expanded and became more organized and efficient as volunteer networks became more experienced. A generation of young and old volunteers not only went elsewhere in Japan but also overseas to lend their assistance. Bureaucrats who once looked upon volunteer types as nosy outsiders began to work with them. Of all the changes these past 20 years, there is nothing Japan can — and should be — more proud of than the generation of people who first volunteered in Kobe and continue to rush out to help the rest of the nation and the world when disaster strikes. The quake also led to some fundamental changes. The biggest was political: The central government set up a more effective disaster response apparatus and a chain of command, especially with regards to dispatching the Self-Defense Forces, that would make it easier for politicians from the prime minister on down to react more quickly to natural disasters. Construction codes were, of course, strengthened. One unintended result was technological, however. Readers of a certain age recall that, in the mid-1990s, cellphones and PHS “handy phones” were around. The latter tended to cut you off in mid-conversation when you passed under a bridge, went into a train station, or found yourself in the middle of a thick concrete building. But they were cheap. Before the Kobe quake, at least in Kansai, cellphones were not really in widespread use. A few weeks later, it seemed they were everywhere and the days of PHS were numbered. Today, except for a few coffee shops catering to an older crowd that have ancient signs asking customers to turn off their PHS phones, the technology is all but forgotten. Yet despite the physical recovery, Kobe has struggled to retain a distinct political and cultural identify in a region ever-more dominated by neighboring Osaka and especially Kyoto. While vestiges of its former role as the region’s international hub remain, Kobe is, as many resident Westerners will happily inform visitors, “a nice place to live.” Nothing wrong with that. But too often the rest of the comment reads: ” … if you have to commute to Osaka.” Twenty years on, Kobe has many reasons to celebrate its recovery, even if, sadly, its role within Kansai is not what it used to be.",

    "source": "Entrepreneur's pet protection center takes shape in Iwate <eos> Ayumi Tanaka is crazy about pets. Ever since she was a child, she has pondered the problem of the thousands of stray dogs and cats that get put down every year and has wondered how she might help to save them. Last spring, she purchased around 40 hectares of land in Takizawa, Iwate Prefecture, and set about building Pets Village, a complex that she hopes will become the world’s largest pet protection center. The center is currently home to about 30 animals. “I hope to change the way Japanese people think about the lives of animals,” Tanaka said. “I’m thrilled with the opportunity to realize my dream, which I believe is worth giving everything I have for.” According to the Environment Ministry, over 128,000 dogs and cats were killed in Japan in fiscal 2013. Tanaka aims to reduce that to zero by the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. Pets Village will be more than twice as large as Europe’s biggest animal protection facility, which is in Germany. Tanaka plans to take in abandoned animals collected from publicly run shelters and to seek foster families for them. In September last year, she opened a dog run. A native of Mihama, Fukui Prefecture, Tanaka had a dog as a child and was constantly troubled by the idea that strays were being killed. “For a long time, I had no idea what I could do,” she said. Her initial career path was not in this direction. She founded a printing company in Tokyo five years ago, but the pets problem continued to bother her. She brought it up with fellow entrepreneurs who shared her dream of creating a “sacred spot” where animals would be protected from all threats. One day, someone who liked the idea let her know about a parcel of land for sale in Iwate Prefecture. Tanaka put her operations on hold, established a foundation called Pets Village and moved to Iwate. The facility is now taking shape. “I’m realizing anew how grave the responsibility of protecting lives is,” she said. For now, Tanaka largely depends on corporate donations but she hopes to become financially independent by producing and selling pet-related goods and offering insurance. Her long-term dream is to build an animal hospital and animal cemetery within the Pets Village premises. “I also hope to deepen cooperation and coordination with animal protection centers across Japan,” she said.",

    "source": "Crime and punishment: Abe's Mideast crisis <eos> In general, crime prevention is a good thing — it helps stop crime. By punishing people for minor transgressions, you stop them from committing larger misdemeanors and discourage crime overall. If the principle is applied blindly, however, it can produce some awkward results. Tokyo police raided the home of journalist Kosuke Tsuneoka in Nakano Ward on Oct. 6 on suspicion he had a role in assisting a student who reportedly wanted to go fight for the Islamic State group in Syria. Tsuneoka is believed to be acquainted with an Islamic State military commander. “(Police) raided his home Sunday and confiscated everything that contained data, from PCs, USB memory sticks, cameras, mobile phones — just about everything,” The Japan Times quoted Hitoshi Takase, a friend of Tsuneoka, as saying. “Tsuneoka thinks the police see him as having a key role in taking the student to Islamic State, or that they want to obtain information about Islamic State from him.” Investigators who looked into his background affirmed as much. The police also seized materials that belonged to Islamic scholar Hassan Ko Nakata, a friend of Tsuneoka who was also believed to have been involved in the student’s attempted trip overseas. Tsuneoka and the student were suspected of violating Article 93 of the Penal Code, which stipulates punishment by imprisonment of three months to five years for people who prepare or plot to wage war against a foreign state in a personal capacity. While the law has rarely been used, the perceived attempt of a Japanese citizen to join the Islamic State group was treated with grave seriousness. And so it should be — the Islamic State is a pernicious terrorist organization that has killed thousands of civilians in the Middle East. After the raids, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the government would prevent Japanese nationals from supporting terrorist groups and that Japan intended to take measures “to curb extremists.” The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Public Security Bureau can be overenthusiastic. It was embarrassed in October 2010, after leaked documents showed police had engaged in extensive surveillance of Muslims in Japan. The leaked files contained names, addresses and personal information on hundreds of Muslims nationwide. In some cases, the files even contained the names of mosques they attended. The government was criticized for effectively treating Muslim citizens as terrorists. All this helped result in the detainment and investigation of both Nakata and Tsuneoka. It also caused unforeseen problems. The two men were on their way to Syria to negotiate the safe return of self-proclaimed military adviser Haruna Yukawa, who was captured by the Islamic State group last year. Tsuneoka was in contact with the group and had been asked to serve, along with Nakata, as intermediaries in a Shariah trial for Yukawa. Both men, now under investigation, were unable to go. In their place, a well-respected journalist and friend of Yukawa, Kenji Goto, went instead. He had negotiated the safe release of his friend before and perhaps felt he could do it again. Fellow journalist Toshi Maeda describes Goto as an extremely compassionate man who felt that all news should involve “the human angle.” Then, around the end of October last year, Goto vanished in Syria. The government knew as early as mid-November that both Goto and Yukawa had been taken hostage by the Islamic State group. In the latest issue of Shukan Post, the magazine details how the Foreign Ministry asked it not to write about Goto’s capture in 2014. The Foreign Ministry told the magazine that ransom negotiations were taking place and the jihadis were likely to cut off Goto’s head if the name of the group was published. As a result, the magazine killed the story. The Foreign Ministry later told the magazine that negotiations had all but broken down; Goto and Yukawa were now being offered as a package deal, with a higher ransom being demanded. Japan has paid terrorists to secure the release of hostages before. In 1977, they paid $6 million to Japanese Red Army hijackers in Dhaka; then-Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda accepted the hijackers’ demands, “on the principle that “human life outweighs the Earth.” So it’s understandable the jihadis probably felt as if they’d hit the jackpot. However, any chance of negotiating with the militants diminished when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited the Middle East. While knowing the Islamic State was holding two Japanese citizens, he pledged at a meeting in Cairo on Jan. 17 to provide assistance worth “$200 million for those countries contending with the Islamic State.” That speech did not go over well with the jihadis and they played the hostage card. In a dispatch on Jan. 20, Jiji Press summed it up succinctly: “The Islamic State violently responds to Abe speech, views Japan as ‘a Christian Crusader.'” The article said his speech resulted in the release of the video as both a warning and retaliation for attempts to block the group’s activities in the Middle East. Japan is now regarded as a full-blown enemy of the Islamic State. After demanding a ransom of $200 million themselves, the jihadis allegedly beheaded Yukawa and made a new demand. Answering a question from the opposition at the Diet on Jan. 27, Abe admitted knowing the Islamic State group was holding Japanese hostages but refused to acknowledge he had disregarded their safety when making his speech in Cairo. The Islamic State, of course, is the real problem. But still … There is another crime in Japanese law we have also been hearing about in the midst of the hostage crisis: professional negligence resulting in death or injury. The Tokyo Prosecutor’s District Public Office last week said it would not hold Tepco responsible for the triple nuclear meltdowns in March 2011 and, therefore, would not press charges. The story was buried in the news cycle amidst all the hostage updates. Imagine if we started holding people responsible for the deaths of people because they failed to pay attention to the risks of what they did? Tepco might go bankrupt or its executives might be jailed. On the other hand, Shukan Post paid attention and killed its story. Abe decided for himself there was no risk or, simply, that he didn’t care. That’s not a crime, right? Full coverage of the Islamic State hostage crisis",

    "source": "German prisoners 'fare better than Russians'; Emperor urges cooperation; Sato promotes peace; Gorbachev accepts multiparty system <eos> 100 YEARS AGO Wednesday, Feb. 3, 1915 German prisoners ‘fare better than Russians’ The German prisoners of war in Japan fare far better than the Russian ones did 10 years ago, says a high officer of the Army, and that is largely due to the decisions of the Hague Conference to pay their salaries on top of other allowances. At one time, this country accommodated over 70,000 Russians, while the number of the present captured is less than 5,000. This smaller number of course works in favor of the Germans in every way. But aside from this consideration, what the Japanese authorities pay the officers and men is much more than what a captive was entitled to before the new convention came into force. The German officers receive 70 sen for their daily food, besides the salaries of Japanese officers of corresponding rank. 40 sen is paid for the daily food of a quasi officer, 15 yen a month as salary and for clothing and 5 yen besides for his sundry expenses. Except for German beer and free outing, the German prisoners suffer no privation at all. The officers, in most cases, get European meals from restaurants at monthly rates, while non-commissioned officers and men cook their own food in their respective places of detention. At present they are all pleased that the cold in this country is not so rigorous as in their Fatherland! 75 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Feb. 13, 1940 Emperor calls for cooperation in crisis His Majesty the Emperor urged cooperation among the people in order to tide the nation over the present crisis in an Imperial message granted Sunday on the occasion of the 2,600th anniversary of the founding of the Empire. The Imperial rescript, made public by the Government at 10 a.m. Sunday in an extra issue of the Official Gazette, reads in substance as follows. “In accordance with the Sacred Way, the Emperor Jimmu established the foundation of the unbroken and everlasting lineage of Imperial rulers. His successors have been all benevolent to the people the people loyal to the rulers until today when the nation greets its 2,600th anniversary. “On this particularly significant Empire Day under emergency circumstances, our subjects, remember the initial achievements of the Emperor Jimmu and the vastness and profoundness of the Imperial policy. “And in complete harmony overcome the present crisis in accordance with the national ideal, thereby enhancing the national prestige and living up to the desire of our Imperial Ancestors.” The “present crisis” referred to was the war in China, which by this time had been continuing since 1937 . 50 YEARS AGO Saturday, Feb. 13, 1965 Sato promotes Japan peace role in Vietnam Prime Minister Eisaku Sato said Friday that the United States was fully advised of Japan’s strong desire to see the spread of armed conflicts in Vietnam checked by all means. “My government will carry out any positive role it feels it can play in promoting peace in Asia anytime,” he said. Sato cited “the Japan-U.S. concurrence in views on the Vietnamese situation” reached between him and U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson during the Jan. 12-13 Washington conference as “verifying” the U.S. understanding of the Japan stand against escalation of the Vietnamese war. Sato said he had requested the U.S. side not to expand the conflict in Vietnam soon after U.S. reprisal bombings were conducted in response to Viet Cong raids on U.S. military facilities in South Vietnam. Sato also noted the third U.S. bombing, which took place on Thursday, was not a continuation of the first but was a separate reprisal for a separate Viet Cong raid. For this reason, he reasoned, the present bombings by the United States cannot be said to be an aggressive act. The U.S. reprisal bombings referred to here were known as Operation Flaming Dart and Flaming Dart II. They were closely followed by a larger bombing campaign, Operation Rolling Thunder, which continued through 1968. 25 YEARS AGO Tuesday, Feb. 6, 1990 Gorbachev accepts multiparty system Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said Monday that the Communist Party is ready to contend for power with other parties, his first public acceptance of a multiparty Soviet Union. Gorbachev, opening a momentous plenum of the Communist Party leadership, presented to the approximately 300 full and candidate members of the Central Committee a draft plan to make the party more democratic. Gorbachev’s statements were made amid intense grassroots pressure for fast radical reform. Monday’s plenum was closed to the press but outside the Kremlin one of those attending, Oleg Nefyodov, gave brief details of Gorbachev’s remarks. “He said it is necessary to take into account reality, that we are living and working already in a multiparty system,” Nefyodov reported. Gorbachev did not give any detailed proposals about how and under what terms the Soviet Union’s multiplicity of political movements could be legalized as political parties, said Nefyodov, a vice president of the Academy of Sciences. Others present at the session said Gorbachev also proposed replacing the position of party general secretary, which he holds, with a party chairman.",

    "source": "U.S. says it's not clear after Cuba talks if new reform-promotion policy will work <eos> HAVANA - The highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Cuba in more than three decades said Friday that two days of talks on re-establishing full diplomatic relations had left her with no sense of whether the new U.S. policy of engagement would achieve its goal of generating reforms that benefit the Cuban people. The Obama administration says the goal of its Cuban policy remains the same: creating more freedoms for ordinary Cubans. Cuban diplomats said throughout the negotiations in Havana that the U.S. needs to abandon hopes of using closer relations to foment change on the island. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson told reporters Friday that the talks had left her with no clearer idea of whether Obama’s new policy has good prospects of success. “It’s very hard to say exactly how this will work,” Jacobson said. “We think that we need to make decisions in our own interest and take decision that are to going to empower the Cuban people but the verdict on whether that succeeds is still to be made.” The United States and Cuba both reported progress toward restoring diplomatic ties after a half-century of estrangement. But it wasn’t immediately clear whether the human rights issue, which has previously blocked closer U.S.-Cuban relations, would pose a threat to the new diplomatic process. “Cuba has never responded to pressure,” Josefina Vidal, the country’s top diplomat for U.S. affairs, told reporters Thursday night. The comments by Jacobson and Vidal lay bare the pressures each side faces at home — the U.S., from Republican leaders in Congress and powerful Cuban-American groups, and Cuba, from hardliners deeply concerned that rapprochement could undermine the communist system founded by Fidel Castro. Earlier in the week, Jacobson hailed the talks as “positive and productive,” focusing on the mechanics of converting interest sections into full-fledged embassies headed by ambassadors. But she also spoke of “profound differences” separating the two governments and said embassies by themselves would not mean normalized ties. Along with human rights, Cuba outlined other obstacles in the relationship. Vidal demanded that Cuba be taken off the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. However, she praised Obama for easing the U.S. trade embargo and urging the U.S. Congress to lift it entirely. “It was a first meeting. This is a process,” Vidal said. In the next weeks, she said, the U.S. and Cuba will schedule a second round of talks, which may or may not be the time to finalize an agreement. Issues on Thursday’s agenda included ending caps on staff, limits on diplomats’ movements and, in the case of the U.S. building, removing guard posts and other Cuban structures along the perimeter. Earlier, the two countries disputed whether human rights had even been discussed at all. Jacobson said the U.S. raised it in the morning meeting; Vidal said it had not come up. Gustavo Machin, Cuba’s deputy chief of North American affairs, later said the delegations spent time in an afternoon session discussing U.S. human rights problems — a reference to recent police killings of black men in Missouri and New York. Cuban state media said the Cuban delegation also complained about the detention of prisoners at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay. A U.S. official said the difference in Jacobson’s statements was unintentional and that the English version — that the U.S “pressed the Cuban government for improved human rights conditions, including freedom of expression” — reflected the delegation’s position. The U.S. and Cuba also talked about human trafficking, environmental protection, American rules to allow greater telecommunications exports to Cuba and how to coordinate responses to oil spills or Ebola outbreaks. The need for at least one future round of talks could set back U.S. hopes of reopening the embassies before April’s Summit of the Americas, which Obama and Castro are expected to attend. Still, after so many years of mutual suspicion, each side stressed the importance of the collegial atmosphere in Havana that included long working lunches and a dinner together.",

Shinya Takagawa, 46, who was at the bank’s branch office in Sagamihara, Kanagawa Prefecture, was already fired in December 2012 when his acts came to light after relatives of the victim, a woman in her 90s, complained to the bank. Monday’s arrest is based on a criminal complaint filed by Mizuho Bank in 2013. According to the police, Takagawa changed the woman’s “hanko” seal necessary for making bank transactions without her consent and withdrew a total of ¥12 million from her savings on three occasions between July and September 2012. Takagawa then spent the money on high-class night clubs and other adult entertainment, the police said, adding they believe she may have been bilked out of even more money.",

The plan, which its labor union has been informed of, comes after Sharp fell into the red again in the business year ended March 31, posting a net group loss of ¥222.3 billion ($1.8 billion) after returning to the black for just a year. The Osaka-based company is also looking to cut winter bonuses to a level equivalent to one month’s salary, a half the previous year’s bonus, and reduce their family and business trip allowances, the sources said Wednesday. Executive officers will have their base salaries cut by 5 percent, they added. The pay cuts are expected to help Sharp lower labor costs by around ¥3 billion in the current business year through March 2016 as it continues to struggle with tough competition from regional rivals. As for its plan to cut around 3,500 jobs in Japan through early retirements, Sharp will target employees aged between 45 and 59, the sources said. After registering massive losses for two consecutive years through March 2013, Sharp reduced salaries and bonuses of both standard employees and executives in the 2012 and 2013 business years, but suspended the measures in the year to March 2015 amid signs that performance was improving.",

    "source": "India's blocking imports of U.S. poultry, eggs is unfair, WTO rules <eos> WASHINGTON - The World Trade Organization has upheld a ruling that India is unfairly blocking imports of U.S. poultry and eggs. The Obama administration called the decision a major victory that should greatly expand export opportunities for American farmers. The ruling announced Thursday by the Geneva-based WTO’s appellate body upheld a decision issued by a dispute panel last October. India imposed the trade barriers in 2007 to prevent avian influenza from entering the country. The WTO said they were too restrictive and not based on international scientific standards. The U.S. poultry industry has estimated that exports of poultry meat alone could exceed $300 million annually once India’s restrictions are removed. The United States exports 20 percent of its poultry meat production each year. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said that the WTO victory showed that the administration was “fully committed to enforcing U.S. rights” in the trade agreements it negotiates. The decision comes as the White House is fighting to win the House votes it needs for approval of fast-track legislation that will allow it to wrap up negotiations for the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. “This decision affirms the importance of basing agricultural trade requirements on sound science,” U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said. The administration said in a fact sheet that while U.S. poultry producers are currently being challenged by an outbreak of avian influenza, those outbreaks do not justify a ban on poultry imports from the entire United States. Under WTO rules, India will be given a period of time to dismantle the barriers that have been found to be illegal. If it fails to dismantle the barriers, the United States would have the right to impose trade sanctions against India equal to the amount of lost agricultural trade. India’s press office at its embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "source": "Shibamata offers a step back into a Tora-san time warp <eos> Tokyo’s Shibamata district has preserved much of its townscape, which is reminiscent of old downtown Tokyo. The Katsushika Ward district located in the eastern-most part of Tokyo, a 20-minute train ride from Asakusa Station on the Keisei Line, is perhaps best known as the hometown of Torajiro Kuruma, the hero of the “Otoko wa Tsuraiyo” (“It’s Tough Being a Man”) film franchise starring the late Kiyoshi Atsumi. In fact, walking out of Shibamata Station, you are greeted by a bronze statue of the films’ hero, better known as Tora-san, who became the symbol of the district after director Yoji Yamada’s series grew into a long-running hit. After the first installment was released in 1969, 48 episodes of the series were created until 1995. Each episode of the popular series features a very similar storyline: The goofy hero coming home to the family-run sweets shop after a long time away working as a traveling salesman. He then somehow throws his family into trouble. The simple yet heartwarming episodes caught the heart of Japanese, and the episodes are occasionally aired on TV even today. Shibamata, the key setting of the films, is a town that has grown up around Shibamata Taishakuten, a Buddhist temple, and that dates back to the Edo Period (1603-1868). The 200-meter-long main approach to the temple is lined with wooden shops selling local specialty kusa dango (rice dumplings flavored with mugwort), good-luck charms and mascots, as well as restaurants offering river fish dishes. Walking eastward down the street eastward, you reach the splendid Nitenmon Gate. Beyond that lies the temple’s main hall, whose walls are decked out with elaborate carvings. A short walk farther east from the temple will take you to the western bank of the Edogawa River, which features a bicycle lane and baseball grounds. There is also a ferry where small wooden rowboats slowly transport people across the 150-meter-wide river — the only place in Tokyo such a service is still available. The ferry used help transport farmers and shoppers in the old days. Today, it operates mostly for tourists. Once the boat leaves the river bank, all you hear is twittering birds and the creaking of the oars. Time seems to slow down while on the boat, which does not operate based on a schedule but departs once the ferryman decides enough passengers have clambered aboard. Shibamata definitely stands out amid Tokyo’s constantly evolving cityscape, retaining an old-time feel. As you stroll through the area, it’s not difficult to imagine Tora-san returning home from his long travels.",

    "source": "Medaka: the fish that helps us understand gender <eos> The diminutive medaka (Japanese rice fish) have been kept as pets since the Edo Period (1603-1868). They are hardy animals, an important quality for a pet, and they naturally occur in a variety of colors, including gold. They have distinctive, some say attractive, eyes (for a fish) — indeed, medaka in Japanese means “with high eyes.” These characteristics made them popular among all classes of feudal Japanese in the past. The natural historian Baien Mouri included a number of color varieties in his 1843 encyclopedia. Three hundred years ago, however, no child taking delight in the glittering little fish in his or her rice field could have possibly imagined the incredible adventures this species would go on, nor the contribution to our understanding of the world it would make. For all the cultural and culinary impact of carp or puffer fish, medaka — scientific name Oryzias latipes — are arguably more important. In the early 1900s, they contributed to genetics. Medaka were the first backboned animal that were found to follow Mendel’s law of inheritance, which explains the way different traits are passed on down the generations. In 1994, medaka became the first vertebrate to have sex and reproduce in space. Male and female fish traveled to the Earth orbit on the space shuttle Columbia, mated in orbit and produced normal babies, all in a weightless environment. Sure, there are rumors, denied by NASA, that humans have had sex in space, too, but the first vertebrates to do it were medaka. Right now, there is a special chamber for them on board the Kibo module of the International Space Station. In the Aquatic Habitat built by the Japanese Space Agency, medaka are being studied to tell us about the impact of micro-gravity in life — not so much for telling us about what will happen to us when we live far from the planet, but for improving life on it. “Studies on bone degradation mechanisms and muscle atrophy mechanisms are applicable to human health problems, especially for the aging society,” says Nobuyoshi Fujimoto of the agency’s Space Environment Unitization Center. The fish, which had its genome sequenced in 2007, will also be bred for three generations on board the space station. So we know a huge amount about medaka, but what we learned last week was still a massive surprise, and could have illuminating implications for humans, too. Scientists discovered last week that changing only one gene in female fish makes them produce sperm in their ovaries, instead of eggs. In every other way the fish are normal female fish. The sperm produced by them are normal sperm, which fertilize eggs normally and produce normal offspring. Scientists at the National Institute for Basic Biology in Okazaki achieved the feat by breeding female fish without a key gene, called foxl3. “In spite of the environment surrounding the germ cells being female, the fact that functional sperm has been made surprised me greatly,” geneticist Toshiya Nishimura says. It’s an entirely new finding, he says, that the sex of the body is independent of the germ cells (the sex cells that produce sperm or eggs) made by the body. “Nobody knew that the germ cells in vertebrates have a switch mechanism to decide their own sperm or egg fate,” says Minoru Tanaka, a colleague of Nishimura. “Our result suggests that once a decision is made, the germ cells have the ability to go all the way to the end. I believe it is of very large significance that this mechanism has been found.” It’s tempting to consider what this finding means for our understanding of human biology. That would be premature: Of course, fish are very different to mammals. Mammals have the foxl3 gene but what it does in humans is as yet unknown — perhaps it has something to do with stopping basic sex cells becoming male? Finding out what it does in us will be trickier than it has been in fish. (It’s worth noting that some 60 percent of medaka genes have equivalent forms in humans, making it a good “model” organism for scientists to study.) However, look again at what Nishimura says and it’s hard not to draw analogies with humans. “That this sexual switch present in the germ cells is independent of the body’s sex is an entirely new finding,” he says. In other words, the body can look like a female, but the germ cells it produces — from ovaries that look like normal ovaries — are sperm. The analogy is comparable with the way we consider gender in humans. We now know that gender is not a binary male or female thing, but a spectrum. Some people who look like they are male or female on the outside, may feel different on the inside. Another possibility is that scientists could potentially flick the same switch in human females and get them to produce sperm. The implications for lesbian couples wanting to have children are profound — though, of course, no one is even talking about this as a possibility yet. I’ve only scratched the surface of what scientists know about medaka. As well as being pets for hundreds of years in Japan, they’ve also been studied in-depth for many, many years. Cute factoid: rather than simply spawning their eggs into the water, female medaka carry their eggs like a bunch of grapes between their fins. Once the eggs are fertilized, female medaka don’t just dump them into the water, they deposit them carefully, one by one, on plants. Fish owners love them, and genetically modified fish are available that glow red, green or yellow, the result of having jellyfish genes inserted to the genome. My favorite is the moonlight medaka — genetically modified so it glows in ultra-violet light. Someone should write a haiku about them: they glow in the dark, they’ve had sex in space and some of the females can make sperm. There’s plenty of material to work with there.",

    "source": "Abe and Hashimoto's political dance will have to avoid stepping on any toes <eos> One month after Osaka voters said no, just barely, to his pet project of fundamentally restructuring the municipal government, Mayor Toru Hashimoto finds himself courted by an increasingly anxious Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who hopes to borrow whatever is left of Hashimoto’s influence in the Japan Innovation Party, and get new security bills passed by the end of the summer. As ever, Hashimoto is playing hard-to-get, even as he is quite happy to find himself back in the national media spotlight. However, the meeting between Hashimoto and Abe a week ago was seen in Osaka as a sign Abe’s government is getting desperate in the face of expert consensus the bills are unconstitutional, and needs all the allies he can find to pass them before the September, when the Liberal Democratic Party presidential election takes place. Clearly, Abe is courting Hashimoto to pressure coalition partner Komeito (the “liberal” wing of the Liberal Democratic Party?). However, last week’s meeting was also another step in the longer-term effort by Abe and his allies to separate Hashimoto and his most ardent supporters in his Japan Innovation Party of constitutional revision from the rest of the party. Yet if anything formal does happen between Abe and Hashimoto, it will have to take place with Komeito’s blessing. This is because, unlike Hashimoto’s party, Komeito has deep experience with, and knowledge of, two critical ministries LDP members cannot afford to alienate lest they anger supporters back home. These are the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. A Komeito representative held the transport ministry post for four years, between 2004 and 2008. The current minister, Akihiro Ota, is from Komeito and has run the ministry since December 2012. Komeito also has a good deal of influence within the health ministry, having had a member serve as minister between 2001 and 2005 and playing something of a mentor role to LDP ministers since. No politician of any party can expect to get re-elected if they fail to meet the welfare needs of their elderly voters or secure permission, and money, for local transport infrastructure projects (needed or not) for their financial backers. Hashimoto’s political and economic philosophy of bureaucratic cuts and privatization of public services might draw praise from wealthy senior corporate executives, foreign investors and the business media, but it’s viewed with deep suspicion by those two ministries (and, of course, by millions of Japanese voters worried about poverty after retirement). By September’s LDP presidential election, Abe might find himself under attack by LDP members worried his courtship of Hashimoto could make their own lives more difficult at these key ministries. Yet none of this is to say Hashimoto’s political career will end in November when he leaves office, despite his announced intention to retire from politics. An appointment to some blue-ribbon committee is possible. Assuming that Abe’s LDP rivals, who see his falling poll numbers and sense an opportunity, don’t unseat him September or that if Abe is replaced, it’s by somebody who is willing to work with Hashimoto. At the moment, however, Hashimoto and his party are divided. His local Osaka party members remain bitter at their defeat in the May referendum to merge the city, which was due to LDP-led opposition. They hate the thought of cooperating with the LDP, and for many, constitutional revision, or Abe’s view of it at least, was never a priority. Thus, for Abe, the question is how to utilize Hashimoto and his party to maximum political advantage. However, given Hashimoto’s testy relationships with other parties and the central bureaucracy, combined with divisions within his own party that could split it and Abe’s declining popularity, perhaps the more pertinent question to be asked is: Will it make any difference to Abe’s own future even if he does?",

    "source": "Home electronics market loses its spark <eos> On May 25, Yamada Denki Co., the largest home electronics retailer in Japan, announced that it would be closing 46 outlets. Given that the stores had been losing money for at least a year and Yamada operates more than 1,000, the announcement wasn’t surprising, though the swiftness of its actions was. The targeted stores were shuttered a week later. NHK visited a store in Tokyo’s Koto Ward three days after the announcement and found hundreds of banners advertising a closing sale with Yamada’s already low prices slashed by up to 50 percent. One employee told the reporter that he had only learned about the store’s closing less than a week earlier, and expressed anxiety over where he would be transferred. A woman who lived nearby said it would be an inconvenience since the store not only sold electronics at a discount, but also inexpensive food and sundries. Why the big hurry? Like all retailers in Japan, Yamada expected some fall-off in sales following last year’s consumption tax hike, but it didn’t expect it to be as steep at 12 percent compared to the previous year. More significantly, Yamada’s business profits declined by 42 percent, and not just due to the effect of the tax hike or last summer’s unstable weather, which was seen to have stunted consumption. Yamada acknowledged that the country’s population is shrinking, especially among its target demographic, and that it had to review its policy, which since the early ’90s was based on one thing only: expansion. As one executive told NHK, Yamada opened so many stores in Japan over the past 20 years that it ended up competing with itself in certain regional markets, so the plan now is to switch from being a “quantity seller” to a “quality seller.” That means not only closing unprofitable stores, but establishing new ones in places where people are likely to spend more money for home electronics, mainly in central urban areas. Yamada is opening new stores near Tokyo and Shinbashi stations in the capital in order to attract foreign tourists with specific items, such as luxury brand accessories and rice cookers, which are very popular among well-to-do Chinese visitors. Yamada has been less forthright about another aspect of its expansion policy, namely a perceived deterioration in service. In its ranking of home electronics retailers, Nikkei BP Consulting listed Yamada in last place in terms of “after-service” for eight years in a row, with customers complaining of unhelpful floor staff. In the retail industry, Yamada is notorious for over-working its salespeople, and even won an award one year for being a “black company” that underpays employees. Yamada, headquartered in Maebashi, Gunma Prefecture, practically invented the idea of the discount mass sales electronics store in the ’90s, when it was in heated competition with two other Kanto area chains, Kato Denki (now K’s Denki) from Ibaraki Prefecture and Kojima from Tochigi. Yamada’s winning strategy was to saturate well-traveled suburban routes with stores featuring large parking lots, a scheme that received a huge boost with the passage of the so-called big store law that former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi passed as part of his deregulation push to please American trade negotiators. Yamada’s aggressive combination of mass sales and low overhead — that is, low personnel costs — drove its profits ever skyward. Everyone else had to follow suit, at least to a certain extent. The upshot is that what were once called discount electronics stores are now just electronics stores, thus forcing out of business the standard retailer associated with a certain manufacturer, like Sony or Panasonic. These neighborhood mom-and-pop operations sold products at recommended list prices, but were full-service in that they delivered the product, installed it and instructed the buyer in its use for as long as they owned it. Sometimes they fixed it for free even after the warranty ran out. This retail model withered after Japan entered its long period of stagnation in the early ’90s and consumers wanted only one thing: low prices. Manufacturers were forced to de-emphasize design for “cost-performance,” which some believe led to Japan’s international decline as a technological innovator. However, the demand for cheap eventually overran discount electronics stores, as more people went online to buy appliances at even lower prices through portal sites such as kakaku.com . This phenomenon led to the practice known as “showrooming”: Consumers only used retailers to check out the merchandise, and then went home and bought it over the Internet. The market may be swinging back. There is a home electronics chain in Kyushu called Atom Denki, which is basically a collective of surviving franchise outlets who work together to buy products en masse but retain the full-service/personal attention nature of the old neighborhood electronics store. They now count more than 1,000 members and continue to grow. Cultural Convenience Club, the company that runs the Tsutaya chain of book and entertainment software stores, recently opened an electronics outlet in the upscale Futago-Tamagawa area of Tokyo called Tsutaya Kaden that in terms of decor is the opposite of the fluorescent-lit, white-metal-rack Yamada model. The interior is all dark wood and indirect lighting, and the salespeople are called concierges. The store features a cafe and a bookseller, and there are no bargain sales. The “regular prices” are cheap to begin with, though not as cheap as they are on the web. As the store’s manager told Asahi Shimbun, the purpose is not selling products, but “lifestyles based on products.” The only phones on display are iPhones and the only TVs ones with 4K screens over 50 inches. In this case, the term “lifestyle” translates as “money to spend on stuff.”",

The key stock index has risen to 18-year highs on robust earnings while the yen’s fall against the dollar and other major currencies has increased the value of their foreign assets in terms of the unit. The latest result topped the previous record of ¥1.696 quadrillion marked three months earlier, the central bank said. By type of assets, cash and deposits accounted for 51.7 percent, the biggest chunk of the total, and stood at ¥883 trillion, up 2.2 percent from the year before. Stock and other equities rose 21.5 percent to ¥184 trillion, while investment trusts grew 21.6 percent to ¥95 trillion. Shares alone increased 20 percent to ¥100 trillion, a level unseen over the past eight years. Although households still have a tendency to choose safer assets, they are not just focused on “safe driving” anymore and gradually rebalancing to riskier assets, a BOJ official said. Assets held by companies excluding financial institutions rose 13.2 to a record ¥1.111 quadrillion as they moved to hold more equities. The quarterly data also showed the outstanding balance of Japanese government bonds grew 4.2 percent to ¥1.038 quadrillion. The BOJ remained the biggest holder of sovereign debt, accounting for 26.5 percent of it, or a record ¥275 trillion, up 36.6 percent, as it gobbles up most of the bonds available as part of its unorthodox monetary easing strategy to banish deflation.",

    "source": "Law gets serious about cycling safety <eos> Bicycle use is growing along with greater public awareness of health and environmental issues, with cities around the country beginning to rent them out to visitors who are eager to tour Japan on the cheap. But this has triggered a rise in fatal accidents caused by reckless cyclists, who are often taken to court and ordered to pay tens of millions of yen in damages for their transgressions. The revised Road Traffic Law took effect June 1 to get a handle on the problem by penalizing cyclists who flout the rules of the road and forcing them to take safety courses if they fail to improve. Let’s take a closer look at the government’s effort to crack down on risky cyclists. How many bicycles are there and why are people riding? According to the National Police Agency, there were 71.551 million bicycles in Japan in 2013, compared with 27.643 million in 1970. A survey carried out by a transport ministry-affiliated research institute found that 42 percent of the 1,945 respondents said they ride regularly to stay fit and offset the lack of serious exercise, while 41 percent do so to cut their commuting or gasoline bills, and 9 percent do so to help the environment. Are cycling-caused accidents on the rise? No, but the ratio of fatal accidents is surging. According to NPA figures, cyclists caused 109,269 accidents last year, down from 188,338 in 2004, while fatal accidents fell to 542 from 870 a decade ago. But the ratio of fatal accidents to the whole actually rose 1.3 points to 13.5 percent over the period. The fatalities, which included pedestrians, other cyclists or the cyclists themselves, rose to 82 from 51 in 2004. Of the 106,427 deaths and injuries, 67,876, or 63.8 percent, were linked to traffic violations such as ignoring traffic lights or stop signs. Why was the law amended? The government wants to curb traffic violations that could lead to serious or fatal accidents. Because of the surge in the ratio of fatal accidents caused by cyclists, the central government revised the law so that it classifies 14 types of traffic offenses and requires negligent cyclists to take safety lessons. The offenses include ignoring traffic lights, passing under railway crossing gates when they are down, failing to stop at intersections where required, riding without properly working brakes and cycling while drunk. They also include violations of other safety regulations, such as cycling while using mobile phones, listening to music through earphones or holding an umbrella. But the regulations can differ from place to place, since they vary by municipality or are set by local public safety commissions. Cyclists are concerned that certain regulations are too ambiguous and give police too much leeway to charge them with traffic violations. What do the new penalties involve? The police can issue tickets to cyclists who are 14 or older. If you get two or more in a three-year period, you would be required to take a safety lesson similar to the one imposed on car, truck and motorcycle drivers. The mandatory safety lesson takes three hours and costs ¥5,700. Cyclists who refuse will be fined up to ¥50,000. The lesson, which can be taken at driver’s license centers and prefectural police headquarters, involves studying traffic rules, reading accounts written by errant cyclists, and accounts written by the victims or their relatives. What are the consequences of serious cycling accidents? Cyclists involved in accidents resulting in severe injury or death can impose enormous financial penalties on themselves and their families. In July 2013, the Kobe District Court ordered a mother to pay ¥95 million in damages after her son hit a 67-year-old woman while riding his bicycle on a hill in Kobe, leaving her bedridden. In January 2014, the Tokyo District Court ordered a male cyclist to pay ¥47 million in damages to the family of an elderly pedestrian he hit and killed after running a red light. In response, the Hyogo Prefectural Assembly in March adopted an ordinance requiring cyclists to buy liability insurance, becoming the first prefecture in the nation to do so. Last Thursday, the Tokyo public safety commission suspended the driver’s license of a man who drunkenly cycled across a busy street at a place where there was no crossing in January and crashed into a motorcycle, killing the driver. The accident thus gave the commission reason to judge that the cyclist posed a danger as a motorist as well. What other measures are being considered to curb bicycle-related fatalities? Some governments, including Ehime Prefecture and the city of Sakai in Osaka Prefecture, have introduced ordinances calling for cyclists of all ages to wear helmets, rather than just children 12 and under who are encouraged to do so under the Road Traffic Law. Experts say that the central and regional governments should also improve the transportation environment for cyclists, including by creating more cycling lanes to improve safety and help them abide by the rules. A 2011 questionnaire conducted by the NPA found that 58 percent of the 790 respondents said they cannot abide by the traffic rules while cycling because of bad traffic conditions.",

The request came after an advisory panel for the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry lowered the requirement for foreigners before undergoing on-the-job training at nursing care facilities in Japan. The ministry is planning to adopt the lower requirement in the fiscal year starting in April 2016. The lowered requirement describes the proficiency as “understanding basic Japanese words,” against “understanding Japanese words used in daily life to some extent” under the earlier requirement. “Communication is important for personal nursing care,” said the society’s leader, Sukero Ito, a professor at Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, after he made the request to Keiko Nagaoka, a senior official in the ministry. “The lowered requirement is insufficient.” Ito also said a system will be required to help interns improve their Japanese proficiency after starting training.",

    "source": "Sony, Panasonic cling to TVs, betting on halo effect of premium sets <eos> Japan’s once-mighty electronics-makers have lost billions of dollars from TVs, but Sony Corp. and Panasonic Corp. won’t quit, saying retreating from the world’s living rooms would close the door to more promising businesses. Consumer electronics account for a shrinking portion of income after restructuring focused Sony on gaming and image sensors and Panasonic on electric car batteries. But TVs remain among their best-known products. Staying in the TV market — particularly at the premium end — keeps the pair relevant and ensures their brands and quality are at the forefront when consumers shop for other electronics, they said. Sony, for example, said it sees a strong correlation between sales trends for its TVs and audio systems. That makes it worth persevering in a TV market dominated by Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd and cheaper Asian rivals, with Sony and Panasonic content to hold modest shares by focusing on high-margin, high-definition 4K models. “TVs are the soul of Sony and we don’t want to be without them,” Ichiro Takagi, head of Sony’s home entertainment and sound business, said in an interview. Investors have long speculated about Sony and Panasonic gradually exiting TVs, reflecting Japan’s declining position in the tech sector. But analysts also said sticking it out was worthwhile as long as they were profitable. “Especially for Sony. . . . If they quit TVs, there’s a chance that the Sony brand will be diminished,” said Junya Ayada of Daiwa Securities. Sony holds 7 percent of an industry it once revolutionized with its Trinitron technology, while Panasonic has 4 percent. South Korean leaders Samsung and LG Electronics Inc together hold about 40 percent. “There was a time when we were going after volume, and we totally lost that race,” said Takagi. “Even in the days of the Trinitron, we only had a share of around 10 percent. I think 10 percent is appropriate now.” Under Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai, Sony has shed thousands of jobs and sold off its personal computer unit after several years of losses. Hirai has not ruled out dispensing with the TV arm as well if it fails to turn a profit. But Takagi said an exit is now less than likely after cost-cutting helped the unit book a small operating profit in the last business year, its first in more than a decade. Moreover, Sony — with interests ranging from its Hollywood studio to PlayStation video games — aims to recapture its cachet as an entertainment-to-electronics group through increased collaboration across the company, Takagi said. TVs encapsulated the sound and picture technology developed by the various businesses, he said. Sony is also aiming for a high-end comeback in audio, earlier this year introducing a portable music player that costs over $1000. “Historically, TVs have been at the center,” Takagi said. “When sales rose, sales in audio and home theater rose as well. As the TV operations recover . . . we’ll see a rise in audio sales.” Pointing to a revival are Sony’s 4K televisions. Last year, the company quadrupled its share of TV sales at Best Buy Co. Inc., the largest U.S. consumer electronics chain, to 12 percent by concentrating on large, high-end models, Takagi said. Analyst Hisakazu Torii at DisplaySearch said Japanese TV manufacturers have little choice but to focus on high-end models, particularly when faced with a rival like Samsung whose smartphone success has given it overwhelming resources. But 4K TVs already account for nearly 40 percent of sets with screens larger than 50 inches, meaning they are starting to lose exclusivity, he said. Analysts say consumers, particularly in the United States, are increasingly opting for larger sets for their living rooms to watch movies and live events, while opting for PCs and smartphones instead of small bedroom TVs. “Once 4K penetration goes beyond 70 percent, that means commoditization and price competition,” Torii said. Panasonic, on the other hand, has not seen a comparable upturn and is increasingly out-sold by previously little-known Chinese manufacturers such as TCL Corp. Its TV division reported seven consecutive years of loss while the overall company turned itself around by focusing on automotive technologies and high-margin home appliances. But Masahiro Shinada, head of Panasonic’s TV business, said maintaining a presence in television makes it easier to sell more profitable white goods — not only by lifting the company’s image, but also winning cooperation from retailers who prefer to deal with manufacturers of high-volume products such as TVs. “They really open the way to selling refrigerators and washing machines,” he said. Panasonic, like Sony, is looking to the high-end TV market for prestige and profitability. But as consumers increasingly watch content on the go, there is a risk of TVs losing their status as brand-defining devices. “Your kids’ cellphones are Samsung, those kids become young adults, those young adults become adults,” said Mark Sasicki, TV buyer at Abt Electronics, the largest single-store retailer in the United States, spread over 150,000 sq. meters of a Chicago suburb. “It plays into their appliance business.”",

    "source": "Suspicion tarnishes 50th anniversary of Japanese-South Korean ties <eos> As Japan and South Korea mark 50 years since the normalization of postwar bilateral relations Monday, the anniversary is unlikely to yield much to celebrate. Relations between the two Asian powerhouses are at possibly the lowest point since the end of the war. According to a May poll by the Yomiuri Shimbun, 73 percent of respondents said they “cannot trust” South Korea — a record high for the second year in a row. And the suspicion runs both ways, with 85 percent of South Koreans voicing mistrust of Japan. At the core of today’s mutual animosity are historical issues involving Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule. According to the Yomiuri poll, which was seeking opinion on Abe’s upcoming war anniversary speech, some 76 percent of Japanese respondents believe repeated apologies by Japanese prime ministers for a variety of historical issues are “sufficient.” This contrasts sharply with South Korea, where a mere 4 percent believe the apologies were enough. Experts recently interviewed by The Japan Times said the root cause of this unbridgeable perception gap can be traced to the nature of a treaty and five related agreements the two countries signed in 1965. The deals were designed to settle all compensation issues surrounding Japan’s contentious 1910 annexation of the Korean Peninsula “completely and finally,” as was clearly and carefully inserted into one of the agreements. But as democracy came to South Korea in 1987 after decades of authoritarian rule, save a brief period in the early 1960s, nationalism and citizens’ groups became more powerful than ever. Under these forces, public frustration over the 1965 deals — concluded under hard-line President Park Chung-hee and continually bottled up under a series of authoritarian rulers — exploded in the 1990s. “The conclusion of the deals in 1965 was kind of a political compromise,” said Yuki Asaba, a professor of South Korean politics at the University of Niigata Prefecture graduate school. “The South Korean side compromised over the settlement of historical issues.” In making the deal, Asaba said, Park had prioritized practical economic benefits over resolving historical issues, given the need for financial assistance from Japan amid the dire economic straits in South Korea at the time. Under the 1965 deal, Japan provided South Korea with a total of $800 million as “economic cooperation” that consisted of a $300 million grant in economic aid, $200 million in loans and $300 million in loans for private trust. Seoul’s annual budget was $350 million at the time. “The sum was definitely a considerable amount since it was bigger than the national budget of South Korea,” Asaba said. Under the terms, Japan provided the funds to the South Korean government in a lump sum. The South Korean government later reportedly took responsibility for compensating individual victims of Japan’s colonial rule. Some of the money was used to pay about 2.6 billion won ($5.38 million) to relatives of some 8,550 victims of Japan’s forced labor, based on a 1974 law stipulating that Seoul would pay 300,000 won ($620) per death, according to media reports. But the South Korean government used most of it to build infrastructure, including a steel plant in Pohang and an expressway linking Seoul and Busan, Asaba noted. Amid today’s politically charged environment, many victims who weren’t among those who received the money have begun calling for compensation directly from Japan, including some of the former ianfu (comfort women), Japan’s euphemism for the females who were forced to provide sex to Japanese soldiers during the war in military “comfort stations.” Tokyo, for its part, has consistently maintained that the 1965 treaty and agreements settled all compensation issues involving Japan’s colonial rule, as stated in them. And South Korea did not raise any official objections to Japan’s position for decades. “At first, the South Korean government took the position that issues regarding the past were all solved by this treaty,” said Kan Kimura, a professor and Korean affairs expert at Kobe University’s graduate school. But as the comfort women issue gained more public prominence in the early 1990s, Seoul began to shift, claiming the issue was not covered by the treaty and agreements, Kimura said. Then, in 2005, the South Korean government announced that its former comfort women, survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings and the displaced draftees on Sakhalin island were all entitled to receive individual compensation from Japan following a recommendation by a private-public committee examining compensation rights. Moreover, in August 2011, South Korea’s constitutional court ordered the government to begin negotiations with Japan on resolving compensation claims for former comfort women, saying failure to seek a solution with Tokyo “constitutes an infringement on the basic human rights of the victims and is a violation of the constitution.” “Ultimately, thanks to the democratization of its political system, the South Korean public now understands that public opinion can and should influence not only the government’s domestic policy, but also its diplomacy,” Asaba said.",

    "source": "Time running out for South Korean 'comfort women' as average age approaches 90 <eos> Year after year, their numbers dwindle. Now, with the average age of former “comfort women” in South Korea approaching 90, time is running out. The Japanese government has been pressed for years to offer compensation money and extend more sincere apologies to the women, who were forced en masse into Japanese military brothels before and during the war. But the South Korean government, too, must help settle the issue, Korean affairs experts say, by persuading the citizens’ groups that wield so much influence over the victims to compromise. “Even if the governments of Japan and South Korea reached an agreement, it would again end up a failure if citizens’ groups oppose a deal and accuse (Seoul) of compromise, branding (the government) as pro-Japan,” said Kizo Ogura, professor at Kyoto University who is an expert on Korean affairs. “This has repeatedly been the case in the past.” Ogura said that to settle the issue, the Japanese government must provide money and extend a fresh apology to the victims it euphemistically calls the ianfu , whose numbers are in dispute but widely thought to range in the tens of thousands. If an offer is made and the support groups refuse to persuade the women to accept it, the survivors will likely die without seeing any deal on compensation, he added. As far as the comfort women issue is concerned, Ogura said, the support groups are more influential than the government in Seoul. “The South Korean government may seem more powerful (than the citizens’ groups), but in reality, the protesting side” is stronger, he said. The comfort women issue began drawing widespread public attention in South Korea after its 1987 shift to democracy began. As the country democratized, citizens’ groups gained more and more power, and many began actively investigating the comfort women issue, experts say. The most influential group — the Korean Council for the Women Drafted For Military Sexual Slavery by Japan — was established in 1990. It demands that Tokyo admit legal responsibility for comfort women issues, calls for official state compensation, punishment for those responsible and a formal government apology endorsed by the Diet. Since the early 1990s, the two nations have seen the comfort women issue become an increasingly divisive. In 1993, then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono for the first time admitted the responsibility of the Imperial Japanese military and other authorities in recruiting women against their will and forcing them to work at comfort stations set up by the military. Two years later in 1995, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama’s administration set up the private Asian Women’s Fund to provide “atonement money” to former comfort women from all nations. The victims received about ¥2 million in donations from private Japanese citizens and up to ¥3 million in “medical and welfare support” from the government, together with a letter of formal apology signed by four successive prime ministers from 1996 to 2001, including Ryutaro Hashimoto, Keizo Obuchi, Yoshiro Mori and Junichiro Koizumi. Despite those efforts, the now-defunct fund came under harsh criticism by South Korean citizens’ groups because Japan refused to admit any legal responsibility for the compensation, and because no personal or public apology had been issued by any of Japan’s top leaders. According to the government, a total of 61 of the known South Korean victims accepted the fund’s offer — less than 30 percent of the 207 who had been officially recognized by Seoul as of 2002. Also, 211 Filipinos, 79 Dutch and 13 Taiwanese accepted the fund’s offer, media reports said. Given their advanced age, both countries should prioritize the issue, said Masao Okonogi, a professor emeritus at Keio University who is a noted expert on Korean affairs. Otherwise, Japan will forever be accused of not working to solve the issue, he said. Okonogi said one possible way to end the stalemate is to establish another semi-public, semi-private fund, this time together with Seoul, in combination with a fresh apology and offer of financial support. “(Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe has said he upholds the Kono statement, so I guess (offering another apology) would not be that difficult,” he said. Both Okonogi and Ogura said they believe ties between the two Asian powers will improve after the summer, when Abe is to issue a statement to mark the 70th anniversary of World War II’s end. Japanese diplomats note that they have already seen signs that Seoul is making efforts to improve the relationship. Domestic criticism that she may have put too much emphasis on historical issues in dealing with Japan may force South Korean President Park Geun-hye’s hand anyway. Despite the passage of more than two years since their inaugurations, Park and Abe have yet to hold a summit, with the South Korean leader citing historical issues — including comfort women — in her refusal to see Abe. Now, Japan, China and South Korea are attempting to arrange a trilateral summit that has been suspended for three years because of Japan’s strained ties with its two neighbors over separate historical and territorial issues. Such a meeting could happen by the end of this year, Okonogi said. If it does, Abe and Park will have no choice but to hold a bilateral meeting there, a move that would help achieve a thaw, he said. In light of China and its rapid economic development, South Korea has shifted diplomatic and economic strategy de-emphasize Tokyo and focus more on Beijing. In 2003, Beijing overtook Tokyo as Seoul’s No. 2 trading partner. The following year, China became the world’s biggest economy, topping Japan’s ally, the United Sates. In the meantime, South Korea’s economic dependency on Japan has declined greatly over the past decade. In near parallel with the decline of Japan’s economic presence in South Korea, Seoul has begun taking an increasingly tough diplomatic stance against Tokyo, experts say. Okonogi said that even though the environment has changed, they still share the same basic values of democracy and market economy. What’s more, both countries are in similar situations, standing between a growing U.S.-China rivalry, he said. “It’s important to see that we share interests, and there could be strategic cooperation in the future as well,” Okonogi said.",

    "source": "Signing of 1965 normalization treaty sparked sharp contrast in reactions <eos> Fifty years ago, when Japan and South Korea signed a treaty to normalize diplomatic ties on June 22, 1965, their leaders toasted the signing in Tokyo as police in Seoul tear-gassed thousands of protesters and politicians who were opposing the move, according to archived reports by The Japan Times. The treaty is “an example set for the whole world that whatever may be the relations existing between the neighboring nations, they can be adjusted in a friendly manner through spirit of mutual understanding,” said Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, calling the treaty “historic,” it said. “Our two countries have trod a thorny path up to the present. A great deal of effort and patience were required to reach this day which promises to erase the nearly half century of unfortunate relations and which has ushered in a new era of mutual cooperation,” said South Korean Foreign Minister Dong Won-lee, who signed the treaty on behalf of President Park Chung-hee, the father of Park Geun-hye, the country’s current leader. But the ceremonial atmosphere contrasted sharply with the rallies in Seoul, where many refused to forget the brutal actions taken by their colonial rulers, and with smaller rallies held in Tokyo by students affiliated with the pro-Seoul Korean Residents Union of Japan (Mindan). In Seoul, police threw up a wall in the capitol compound to prepare for a possible attack by protesters, and about 6,000 students joined a pitched fight with riot squads numbering in the hundreds, it said. In Tokyo, meanwhile, the Japan Socialist Party, the main opposition force, attacked the treaty’s signing as an “arrangement forced upon both Japan and South Korea by the United States in line with its strategy in Asia,” The Japan Times reported. The JSP claimed the treaty was aimed at creating a “Northeast Asian Military Alliance” among Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, the newspaper said. Political observers pointed out that the confrontation between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition parties was likely to intensify when an extraordinary Diet session was to be convened later in the year to ratify the treaty, it was reported. After the treaty was inked, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Edwin Reischauer released a statement welcoming the move. “Great credit is due to the statesmen on both sides who have worked so hard to make possible this achievement, which I believe is greatly to the benefit of the two countries concerned and to the whole world.”",

    "source": "Sincere climate pledge or 'sleight of hand'? <eos> Last week, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Cabinet announced Japan would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent by 2030, based on 2013 levels. The plan will be presented to delegates at a United Nations conference on climate change in Paris this December. The goal is strongly supported by Japanese utilities and powerful business lobbyists, but has been slammed by domestic and international experts as falling far short of what is needed, even as Japan itself feels the impact of a warming planet. What, exactly, does last week’s announcement about reducing greenhouse gases mean for Japan? It means Japan will commit to reduce, in 15 years, emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 26 percent compared to its level of emissions in 2013, which amounted to 1.408 billion tons. The reductions are expected to be made through a combination of policy measures and technological developments. Why is this goal being criticized? There are several reasons. From a scientific viewpoint, climatologists have warned that unless the average global rise in temperature can be kept under 2 degrees, the Earth could reach a tipping point where climate change would become irreversible. The science uses the 1990 emissions levels as the base for estimating the reduction ratios needed to offer the greatest possibility of keeping the temperature rise under 2 degrees by midcentury. The most proactive governments base their emissions targets on calculations that use 1990 as the base year. This produces cuts that are larger than those based on later years. The second reason is political. As the initiator of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the world’s first internationally binding agreement to tackle greenhouse gases, and given Japan’s international reputation as a leader in environmental technologies, the international community had long counted on the Japanese government to continue showing leadership on the issue. Last week’s announcement merely marked the formal decision on a plan that had been in the works for months, and one that had been roundly criticized. In an opinion piece for Kyodo News at the end of April, John Prescott, a former British deputy prime minister who was at the Kyoto Protocol conference, said a 26 percent reduction by 2030 based on 2013 levels amounted to only a 17 percent reduction in terms of 1990 levels, and that announcing such a target would put Japan’s international climate leadership in doubt and raise questions about its commitment to multilateralism. Nongovernmental organizations were even more critical. In a letter to Abe, Wael Hmaidan, executive director of Climate Action Network International, an umbrella group of 900 climate and environment-related NGOs, said the 26 percent target based on 2013 levels represented “sleight of hand” by Japan, and that by failing to send a strong message internationally on its commitment to reduce emissions, Tokyo’s ideas on how to come to an agreement at the Paris conference in December will fall on deaf ears. In Japan, the Kiko Network, one of the country’s oldest and largest groups dedicated to climate change issues, also criticized the target, saying it merely left the burden of dealing with climate change to the next generation. The group also said it could not be linked to the government’s own goal of reducing emissions by 80 percent by 2050. What reduction targets have other countries put forward at the Paris conference? The European Union has announced an economy-wide target involving a cut of at least 40 percent in domestic greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by 2030. The United States has a target to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 (equivalent to between 14 and 17 percent below 1990 levels). China is expected to make an announcement about its goals for the Paris conference soon, but said last November its goal was to see its carbon dioxide emissions peak by 2030 at the latest, and that it aimed to have nonfossil fuel energy supplying 20 percent of its total primary energy supply. Brazil pledged to reduce its emissions by between 36.1 percent and 38.9 percent in 2020 compared to business-as-usual (BAU) emissions. What climate change impacts have already been noticed in Japan? Compiling and translating data from the Meteorological Agency and Japanese and foreign climate experts, a WWF report released in 2008 noted that the mean annual temperature in Japan had increased by 1 degree over the past century overall, but that average winter temperatures in Hokkaido had increased by 1.3 degrees. Significant reductions in snowfall nationwide, as well as hotter days and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as floods, were also noted. What predictions are being made about the future impact of climate change in Japan, regardless of emissions goals? A 2013 Environment Ministry report suggested the average temperature could rise between 2.1 and 4 degrees by the end of this century, compared with the 1980-1999 period. The report also noted that areas with a suitable temperature for coral will shift northward but that increased acidification in the ocean means the habitat for tropical and subtropical corals around Japan could decrease by half by 2030 and disappear completely by 2040. As for food supply, the ministry said, warmer temperatures mean yields of irrigated rice will increase (especially in areas like Hokkaido) but that the quality could decrease. The WWF report, by contrast, sees a temperature increase of two to three degrees over the next century. This means higher precipitation, especially during the summer months, and an increase in days with temperatures exceeding 35 degrees.",

Demand for cars was sluggish during the fiscal year ended March 31 after the first stage of the doubling of the consumption tax raised the levy by 3 points to 8 percent, tipping Japan into yet another recession. It was the nation’s first tax hike in 17 years. The second stage, which has been delayed, will raise it to 10 percent.",

    "source": "E-textbooks to open digital can of worms <eos> As the world goes digital, many schools are trying to introduce digital materials into the classroom to encourage studying and meet the needs of students’ increasingly diverse needs. In May, the education ministry formed a panel to discuss the use of digital textbooks and whether to replace the physical ones. It is also weighing the possible technological, economic and legal ramifications of such a shift. How will education change by going digital? What are the challenges posed by introducing digital textbooks? Here’s what The Japan Times dug up about using digital textbooks in Japan: What constitutes a digital textbook? The education ministry says the digital materials currently used in classrooms are not textbooks in the strict sense, but supplemental materials, including learning aids, and audio and video content. They also allow students to rotate images on display screens to get a 360-degree view, or click to access extended explanations for words that appear in text. Digital materials for studying English may include videos designed to help students listen repeatedly to work on pronunciation by watching how the speaker’s mouth moves. Such materials are mainly designed for teachers to use in front of students, with the help of digital markers, magnifiers and links to help make lectures more creative. Some offer students devices, mostly tablet computers equipped with functions to facilitate communication via note- and memo-sharing over a network. These systems can also keep track of study records to help teachers provide proper guidance to each student. Are schools in Japan sufficiently digitized? Although slowly improving, Japan still lags in introducing information and communications technology, or ICT, in education. According to the education ministry, the number of students per computer remained at 6.5 in 2014, compared with its goal of 3.6 by fiscal 2017 set in the Second Basic Plan for the Promotion of Education. This puts Japan behind countries like Singapore, which had a student-computer ratio of 2.0 in 2010, the United States, whose ratio stood at 3.2 in 2008, and South Korea, which had a ratio of 5.0 in 2007, according to an internal affairs ministry report. On average, only 37.4 percent of Japan’s public schools were using digital materials in the classroom in 2014, which is a slight improvement on 32.5 percent from the previous year. The exception is Saga, which was leading the nation with an 86.1 percent penetration rate for digital materials in 2014, the report said. Saga has been forging ahead with such efforts since 2011. In April 2014, the prefecture installed digital devices for student use in all public high schools. That generated a positive reaction from both teachers and students, who enjoy participating in interactive lectures, an official from the Saga Prefectural Board of Education said. What are the merits of using digital textbooks? Digital textbooks can help nurture creativity, said Toru Kawase, an official in charge of digital promotion at major textbook publisher Tokyo Shoseki Co. Unlike traditional lectures held in conjunction with printed textbooks, where students tend to be evaluated only by whether they can regurgitate the correct answers on tests, digital textbooks allow teachers to evaluate the process students use to determine the answers, Kawase said. “The good thing about digital textbooks is . . . students can deepen their thinking through trial and error” as they share and discuss the process with other classmates, he said. In fact, digital materials helped students, including those shy about giving presentations, to actively express their opinions and organize them in an effective manner, according to the ministry’s experimental study on ICT education. Digital textbooks can also support students with learning disabilities because they offer alternative ways to read or write, including through audio narration of text passages. Children who can’t speak Japanese can benefit from translation apps. What are the hurdles to introducing digital textbooks? Legal revisions will be necessary to adopt digital textbooks as the nation’s official textbooks, said media and governance professor Ichiya Nakamura of Keio University, who is vice chairman of the promotional group Digital Textbook and Teaching. Under a revision of the School Education Act in 2014, any textbook used at school must literally be printed on paper and pass the ministry’s screening process, Nakamura told a symposium on digital textbooks on May 25 on Keio’s campus in Minato Ward, Tokyo. Money is also a challenge. The cost of managing the distribution of digital devices to students will fall to local governments, while schools will have to bear the enormous expense of creating an environment that can take full advantage of the technology, such as by setting up wireless networks and building a database for the data to be used. Developing digital textbooks is also costly for the makers, Kawase said. As an example, he said it costs about ¥100 million to create social studies textbooks for use by elementary school students between the third and sixth grades because of all the copyrights held on digital images and videos. How the government would screen such textbooks is another concern, Kawase said, adding that it’s too much of a burden to check all of the content, including the movie files and web pages that are attached.",

    "source": "Law still a long way behind fertility boom <eos> As the population declines, the number of domestic businesses involved in fertility is growing, giving birth to a slew of additional problems. Government statistics show the country’s population dropped by 215,000 last year, as people are waiting longer to get married and have children. The situation is causing so much alarm among government officials that one city is now offering subsidies to women who want to freeze their eggs and try in vitro fertilization at a later date. A Kafka-esque case currently being contested in court has come to highlight how the country’s legal and regulatory system has completely failed to keep up with recent developments. A number of questions come to mind: When a couple agrees to have an IVF, who owns the sperm? Do sperm have rights? Can a wife take sperm without telling her husband and use it to have a child? Is that fraud? In February, Japanese-American businessman Eric Young filed a lawsuit against one of Japan’s largest fertility clinics, K Clinic, asking for damages and access to all the clinic’s medical records so that he can verify who is the mother of his son: his ex-wife or her younger sister — or both of them? The boy, who was born on June 24, 2008, was conceived via in vitro fertilization. Three years later, the couple conceived a second child via in vitro fertilization with the help of K Clinic in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district, although his wife miscarried. The boy’s parentage was cast in doubt after the Tokyo Family Court ruled that Young’s former wife had swapped her husband’s sperm with those of her of lover without his consent or knowledge when trying to conceive her second child. In addition, the court ruled, she replaced her eggs with those from her younger sister. The sperm that had been deposited by Eric Young was allegedly discarded. The whole debacle was covered extensively by weekly magazine Shukan Gendai. Young now wants to know whether it was his sperm that was combined with the eggs of his sister-in-law for the first pregnancy. K Clinic has refused to divulge any records related to the procedures, citing the country’s personal privacy laws. “(It’s) an interesting and highly unusual case that raises many questions,” said Robert Klitzman, director of the bioethics masters program at Columbia University. Complicating the matter, the clinic had advised Young and his wife that they could use an in vitro method that combined the “white” of a younger woman’s egg (the mitochondria) with the “yolk” of his wife’s egg, resulting in a child that some people might consider to have three parents. On Feb. 3, CNN reported that U.K. lawmakers had approved such a procedure. In the first court session in April, K Clinic’s lawyer claimed the clinic had no records of whose eggs or sperm were used to produce Young’s son. In written documents submitted to the court, the clinic admitted it didn’t have a system in place to verify the identity of either eggs or sperm donors at the time. Young’s attorney claimed his client had a right to know what was done with his sperm, and whose egg was used in combination with that sperm. He claimed that sperm had “personal and moral rights” known as jinkakuken , which are guaranteed by the Constitution. “It’s half a life and since sperm cannot speak for itself, we are representing the sperm on behalf of its guardian — the father,” attorney Nobayasu Ogata said. “A failure to disclose the information on what was done with my client’s sperm by the clinic is not only deplorable, it’s unconstitutional.” Neither K Clinic or Young’s former wife responded to requests for comment via email, fax, telephone and requests made via the firm’s lawyers. “With minimal government oversight and a lack of internal regulations, (K Clinic) enabled the submission of faked identities and the unauthorized switching of the sperm and eggs of their patients,” Young said. “If they aren’t keeping records, then we will have situations where a child might never know who his/her true biological parents are.” The country’s laws a long way behind the booming fertility industry. Currently, for instance, no law exists that establishes a legal relationship between a child born to a surrogate mother and the man and woman whose genetic material was used to conceive the child. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that even if a DNA test proves that a father and child are not related, the father will still legally be the child’s parent based on the Civil Code’s definition of legal paternity. In other words, a man is financially obligated to provide for a child born to his wife even if it is revealed that the sperm used to conceive it came from another man. In the written arguments submitted to the court, K Clinic argued that if Young claimed the second pregnancy was not achieved with his sperm, there was no basis for him to claim emotional damages or demand that the medical records be released. “We have a duty as doctors to protect the privacy of our patients,” the clinic said. “If the ex-wife secretly provided a third party’s sperm to the clinic, (we) can also be thought of, like the plaintiff, a victim deceived by the patient. ” The ruling coalition government is attempting to create a legal framework to address questions such as how to define parenthood and whether a child has a right to know his or her genetic parents. According to a November article in the Mainichi Shimbun, the Liberal Democratic Party approved a bill that would require fertility clinics to register with the government. Clinics that do not comply with government guidelines that have yet to be created could have their licenses revoked under a law that has yet to be approved. In the meantime, men wishing to have children via an IVF who are concerned about mix-ups may wish to think about color-coding their sperm or, at least, donate a label maker to their clinics. It’s nice to keep track of these things.",

Mr. Shoda went to India last December with representatives of the Matsuda Company of Yokohama and other companies. Speaking of his trip, Mr Shoda said: “We went round the country with the object of extending the market for our goods. The representatives of the firms took samples of their goods, ready to receive orders. We have obtained exceedingly good results. Our idea was that we should be satisfied if we got orders to the amount of ¥3,000; but we have received orders for over ¥1 million. The principal goods for which order have been received are cotton goods, toys, tea cases, cement, and some other goods. It is interesting when we consider that these goods have never been exported to that country before. “Before the war Germany had been exporting goods, to the tune of ¥80 million per year to India, while our exports to that country had not gone beyond ¥30 million. But since the outbreak of war the exports from Germany have been stopped and the exports from English firms have also decreased by 40 percent. India is now, therefore, importing principally from the States and Japan. Hitherto our country has been exporting only such goods as matches, silk goods, knitted goods, and glassware. But the demand for other goods, as shown by the orders received lately, are now being received. This is a golden opportunity for the extension of our market in India.” 75 YEARS AGO Sunday, June 16, 1940 Hitler’s war machine rolls into French capital Swinging triumphantly down the broad and fashionable Champs Elysees, the grim vanguards of Chancellor Adolf Hitler’s mighty war machine rolled thunderously into Paris from the northwest early this morning, climaxing a 35-day lightning offensive, which began with the invasion of Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg. Authoritative information reaching Berlin from the abandoned French capital reported that swift, dust-stained Nazi tanks, ominously dominating the streets, led the German advance into Paris. German units symbolically circled the Arc de Triomphe, from which the city’s 12 main boulevards and avenues radiate, and went down the broad Champs Elysees. The advance into Paris began at dawn. Only a few Parisians watched the Nazi forces enter the capital, standing with bared hands, tearfully silent and tense. It was for many the second time within their memory that German had marched into the city in triumph as apparent victors. As the sun rose higher more units joined the parade. Motorized infantry battalions and steel shielded trucks raced across the old Seine river and southwards towards Etoile. Immediately after French troops withdrew from Paris leaving the city to its own fate, the police, fire department, and other departmental services of the capital were placed in the disposal of the conquerors, offering to maintain order and discipline during the march of the Germans. The radio stations of Paris, it was reported here, quickly were occupied and were playing Nazi music. It is said that only a third of Paris’ normal population of 3 million remains. 50 YEARS AGO Wednesday, June 2, 1965 Mine blast death toll in Fukuoka tops 160 One hundred and sixty miners were confirmed dead, with another 76 unaccounted for and given up for lost, in one of Japan’s biggest mine disasters ever when a gas explosion ripped through the No. 1 pit of the Yamano Colliery at Inatsuki in Fukuoka Prefecture early Tuesday morning. Thirty miners were injured, many of them seriously. The mine management initially announced the total of miners and officials underground as 552, but later indicated the figure might be lower. Of this number, 314 managed to crawl out to the surface. A Fukuoka Prefectural police spokesman said early this morning that hope had been abandoned for the fate of the 70 still unaccounted for. A rescue worker who emerged after a few hours underground said that inside the of the pit near the scene of the blast was filled with dense gas, preventing rescuers from going further. An official of the mining company said a group of eight men were digging inside the pit with dynamite at the time of the explosion and speculated that this might have touched off the gas explosion. 25 YEARS AGO Saturday, June 23, 1990 Japan passes U.S as top donor of overseas aid Japan surpassed the United States to become the world’s top donor of official development assistance in 1989, the Foreign Ministry said Friday. In terms of disbursement, Japan’s ODA last year totaled $8.95 billion, down 1.9 percent from the preceding year, a report says. In yen terms, however, Japanese overseas aid posted a 5.6 percent increase over last year, totaling ¥1.23 trillion. The U.S dropped to second place with $7.66 billion, followed by France, whose disbursement totaled $7.47 billion, according to the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD ascribed the fall in U.S aid to a high number of 1988 contributions and a delay in disbursements to the International Development Association, affiliated with the World Bank, officials said. Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands continue to stand out as countries with the highest ODA/GNP ratios, with Norway and Denmark in front at 1.02 and 1.00 percent, respectively.",

    "source": "China's dog meat festival draws rare criticism <eos> YULIN, CHINA - For many residents of the town of Yulin in southern China, the peak of summer is the perfect time to get together with family and friends — and consume copious amounts of dog meat. Thousands of dogs are expected to end up on the chopping block during the city’s annual dog meat festival, which has become increasingly controversial in China. Dog ownership was once looked down upon as a decadent bourgeois habit, but China’s growing middle class has started to fight what it sees as barbarous abuse of man’s best friend. On Monday, a group of about 25 animal rights activists briefly unfurled banners in front of the city government office, demanding an end to the festival, but they were quickly hustled away by unidentified men. The city’s dog market has become a site for clashes of supporters and opponents of the trade. In the sweltering heat, tempers can often flare. “There are all sorts of cultural norms about what you can eat, you eat turkey, so why are you trying to force us to not eat dog meat?” shouted one dog meat supporter. Eating dog is good for your health at the hottest time of the year, say supporters, and it is just like any other meat. “It’s healthy, just like raising pigs or chickens, it’s fine,” said Teng Jianyi, as he tucked into a dog dish with some friends. While many Chinese have signed online petitions seeking a ban on the festival, others take a more direct approach. Last year, Yang Xiaoyun made headlines after spending 150,000 yuan ($24,160) to rescue about 350 dogs. Yang, who comes from northern China, has returned this year with funds raised from around the country, but she would not say exactly how much. She hoped to set up a home for the rescued dogs near Yulin, she said, undeterred by the prospect of any hostility there. “At the moment we don’t have the ability to change people’s habits, this is the government’s responsibility, isn’t it?” Yang said. Despite the complaints, many Yulin residents vowed to continue eating dog. “This is one of our traditions,” said Liang Xiaoli, who returned home especially for the festival. “They criticize us, saying we don’t have compassion or humanity, but I think every person has different circumstances,” she added. “You can’t just lump all people together. For example, if I think eating pork is really brutal, then no one can eat pork. That’s not on.”",

    "source": "Hate speech may lack clear definition but Kansai trying to squelch it <eos> OSAKA - More than two years after the anti-Korean group Zaitokukai made international headlines with racial slurs and threats of violence, local governments around Japan are making it far more difficult for any group attacking minorities to operate. As of last month, over 100 prefectural, city, town and village assemblies had released statements condemning hate speech. While not legally binding, they send a clear message to their local bureaucrats, who have discretion over approving requests to use public meeting facilities and granting permits for street demonstrations. The hoped-for result, therefore, is that hate groups will find it more difficult to secure space to shout racist comments and go on threatening public tirades than was the case a couple years ago. In the Kansai region, Kyoto, Nara, Hyogo and Wakayama prefectures have all denounced hate speech. Municipal assemblies in Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, and 16 other Kansai cities have also spoken out against hate speech. Given the huge influx of international tourists over the past two years, especially from East Asia, Kansai’s major cities in particular are worried about groups using its facilities and streets to spread messages of racial hatred. Kadoma, a city in Osaka Prefecture, took the lead last year in doing more than just issuing statements. Under current regulations, the city has said it will not grant use of public facilities to groups and individuals who habitually engage in violent and discriminatory behavior. In the event that permission to use, say, a public park for a rally has already been granted, Kadoma could revoke permission or stop the rally if it discovers the applicant fits the criteria for denial. “Kadoma will judge all applications to use public facilities on the basis of protecting residents’ safety and dignity,” the city said in a statement. Driving much of the concern at the local level is the impact such venomous and discriminatory speech and ideas might have on schoolchildren who walk past the rallies, or on those who can hear the rants from classrooms or other public facilities. In June 2013, Yamagata Prefecture refused permission for a Zaitokukai meeting at a prefecture-run facility because it contained a library where children often visited. Of course, deciding what constitutes hate speech and grounds for refusing permission for public rallies can be something of a slippery slope. With no legal definition of hate speech upon which court decisions can be based, leaving decisions about granting or refusing permission for public facilities to bureaucrats raises difficult questions. For example, if local governments hosting U.S. military bases were to decide that anti-base protesters screaming “Yankee, go home!” are engaging in a form of “discrimination against foreigners,” could they, under the pretext of cracking down on “hate speech,” not allow them to demonstrate? Or could atomic power plant workers claim anti-nuclear protesters are discriminating against them by staging protests and, to use the language of Kadoma, damaging their dignity and safety (economic) by making comments that they might claim are a form of hate speech? Would nuclear supporters then ask local assemblies overwhelmingly tied to the nuclear power industry to crack down on anti-nuclear demonstrations by claiming pro-nuclear workers risk becoming victims of anti-nuclear protesters’ “hate speech”? As ridiculous as the above questions may sound, without specific national laws banning racial discrimination to guide them, the potential for local bureaucratic decisions that violate the constitutional rights to freedom of speech and assembly only grows. Thus any entities sincerely attempting to control what most people would instinctively say is hate speech should keep in mind that old saying about the road to hell being paved with good intentions.",

Police are investigating the incident as a case of possible theft, after Akihiko Tamura, director general of the ministry’s Civil Aviation Bureau, lost the bag containing the list and tablet computer on a train on his way home late Friday. Tamura is in charge of policies including regulations on the use of drones as well as measures to prevent aerial terrorism, the ministry said Sunday. The tablet is supposedly locked with a password. Tamura put his bag on the overhead rack of the train he took from Tokyo at around 11 p.m. Friday after drinking alcohol, the ministry said. He fell asleep before realizing he missed his stop in Kanagawa Prefecture and the bag was gone. The government is currently drawing up regulations on the use of drones in public places in response to a series of incidents that have stoked fears that unmanned aircraft could be used for terrorism. In the most serious of these, a drone with a minuscule amount of radiation was found on the roof of the prime minister’s office building in April. A man was arrested for allegedly flying the drone there. The loss of Tamura’s bag could add to criticism of the government’s management of information. The transport ministry said it will take steps to prevent a repeat of this kind of incident. Officials were forced to apologize earlier this month after it was discovered that the Japan Pension Service system had been hacked and more than a million items of personal data had been leaked.",

    "source": "Osaka's assault on ethnic invective stalls <eos> OSAKA - With last week’s decision by the Osaka Municipal Assembly to delay a decision on what would have been Japan’s first city ordinance to combat hate speech and to issue a nonbinding statement instead, local legal efforts to crack down on racist rhetoric have slowed. Although the assembly may take up the issue again when it reconvenes in September, there are numerous hurdles remaining to realizing an ordinance. All political parties agree something should be done to halt racial slurs and threats of violence against ethnic minorities. But differences of opinion over how effective an ordinance would be and whether it could give too much authority to an outside committee loyal to the mayor meant that unanimous approval by the assembly, sought by all parties, was impossible. Last week’s statement adds to the many local calls for the central government to enact legislation that would effectively combat hate speech and protect the rights of minorities. “In recent years, hate speech directed at foreigners in Japan with a specific nationality has taken place, creating concern about human rights problems involving foreigners. In the streets of Osaka as well, demonstrations involving hate speech have frequently occurred,” the statement noted. City assembly members also pointed out that the United Nations Human Rights Committee has expressed concern about the spread of speech that meets the definition of racial discrimination under the terms of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Japan, as a signatory to the convention, has long been advised to adopt measures to combat such racially biased speech. In addition, through legal restrictions, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has strongly recommended Japan adopt measures to deal with hate speech. Last August, a CERD report on Japan recommended the country take five specific actions to combat hate speech: 1. Firmly address manifestations of hate and racism as well as incitement to racist violence and hatred during rallies; 2. Take appropriate steps to combat hate speech in the media, including the Internet; 3. Investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute individuals, as well as organizations, responsible for such acts; 4. Pursue appropriate sanctions against public officials and politicians who disseminate hate speech and incitement to hatred; 5. Address the root causes of racist hate speech and strengthen measures of teaching, education, culture and information. The issue of hate speech in Osaka has become particularly sensitive due to the large number of Korean residents and an incident that took place in 2013 in the city’s Tsuruhashi district, home to many Koreans. At a public demonstration sponsored by the anti-Korean group Zaitokukai, a 14-year-old girl began screaming racial slurs and death threats at Koreans. Videos of the event were quickly translated into several languages and uploaded on YouTube, earning Osaka an international reputation as a place that condones hate speech against ethnic minorities. “Furthermore, as a recent example, on Dec. 9, 2014, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal of a group that engaged in hate speech. That decision confirmed an Osaka High Court decision that the group’s activities met the convention’s definition of racial discrimination and was beyond something that was protected speech. We strongly request that, from the view of guarding human rights, the central government promote effective legal measures to lead to the eradication of hate speech,” the June 10 statement concluded, referring to the decision against the right-wing hate group Zaitokukai. The group appealed decisions by the Osaka High Court and the Kyoto District Court after both ordered it to pay nearly ¥12 million in compensation to a Kyoto school whose students are ethnic Koreans, after it came under attack by Zaitokukai members during demonstrations in 2009 and 2010. Since then, pressure has been growing on the city of Osaka to publicly condemn acts of hate speech. But embarrassed by Zaitokukai and emboldened by the court decisions, Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, as well as his Osaka Ishin no Kai (One Osaka) political group and other assembly members, decided to go a step further and try to pass an ordinance, even though there were questions about whether it would violate the constitutional right to freedom of speech. The proposed ordinance was developed with input from local Korean human rights’ organizations and lawyers. It would define as hate speech expressions that call for the elimination of ethnic groups and individuals from society and restrict their freedoms and rights, or incite violence against them. Written attacks on the Internet and social media against groups and individuals might also be defined as hate speech. Key to determining what the city would define as hate speech would be a committee of five legal experts and others involved in human rights issues. They would be appointed by the mayor to examine specific hate speech allegations, and would be responsible for gathering testimony if they decided a particular case warranted investigation. Each member would serve for two years and could not publicly discuss any secrets (designated by city bureaucrats) they come across while doing their jobs, even after their term as a committee member ends. Violating the secrecy agreement would be grounds for dismissal by the mayor. In the event the committee’s probe concluded there was merit to a claim of hate speech, the city would offer assistance if the victim decided to take the perpetrators to court. This includes an as yet undetermined amount of financial assistance for legal fees. In addition, there would be a “name and shame” effort whereby the names of the groups and individuals who made the comments, and the content of their remarks, would be posted on the city’s website. “The committee of third-party experts would make decisions based on existing laws, and the opinions of legal experts would have to be respected. It’s clear we have to make rules that prohibit hate speech,” Hashimoto said last month when the resolution proposal was formally taken up. Whether such an ordinance will pass soon, especially before mayoral and gubernatorial elections in November, is questionable. Kim Kwang-min, secretary-general of the Osaka-based nonprofit organization Korea NGO Center, expressed disappointment, but not surprise, that the assembly only voted for a nonbinding statement. “The ordinance resolution wasn’t perfect but it is needed. A lot of politicians are saying that Osaka should wait on the central government to pass a national law against hate speech. But I think on this issue, it’s the local governments, which are closer to the problem, that can take the lead,” Kim said.",

    "source": "Suntory gains ground in battle of the machines <eos> At the end of May, Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd. announced it would buy Japan Tobacco Inc.’s drinks vending machine subsidiary in July. At a news conference to explain the deal, Suntory President Nobuhiro Torii said the purchase would help his company achieve its goal of becoming the biggest-selling beverage maker in Japan. The acquisition would add 266,000 vending machines to Suntory’s existing 490,000, thus bringing it closer to Coca-Cola (Japan) Co., the No. 1 company with 980,000 vending machines. According to the Japan Vending Machine Manufacturers Association, there are 2.5 million of the devices operating in Japan, most of which sell soft drinks. Vending machines are considered the most effective means of selling soft drinks in Japan, which is why Suntory is so determined to increase its penetration. The problem is that, as with any sales distribution network, the effectiveness of vending machines is all about location, and almost all the good locations in Japan were taken years ago. JT’s machines will provide Suntory with choice locations without having to go out and find new ones. So even though Suntory is reportedly paying ¥150 billion to JT for its machines, Torii thinks his company can save several billion yen a year in vending-machine placement and location research expenses. The actual value of the machines Suntory is buying is estimated to be about half the price it is paying to JT. In addition to the devices and the locations, Suntory also gains JT’s superior product supply network for soft drinks and its established “full-service line” of products. JT sells not only its own beverages in its vending machines, but also popular brands from other manufacturers, and apparently Suntory is not going to change that. Rather than replace the products in JT’s machines with its own, Suntory is also acquiring two beverage brands: the Roots canned coffee line, and the Momo no Tennensui bottled water line, which are quite popular. Suntory has said it will start re-marketing the two brands later this year with “added value.” The strategy seems to be especially important for Roots, whose dedicated fans are considered “different” from those who regularly buy Suntory’s canned coffee brand, Boss. Rather than try and make Roots drinkers switch to Boss, Suntory is simply acquiring those fans. The canned coffee market in Japan was worth about ¥739 billion in 2013, and though it’s shrinking, it is still considered a huge money maker, especially when the product is sold through vending machines, where costs are fixed and profit margins higher than they are with other retail networks. In the past several years, convenience stores have started selling fresh coffee, and a cup is usually cheaper than canned coffee, which normally costs at least ¥130 for 190 ml, so canned coffee sales in convenience stores are dropping while those from vending machines aren’t. Coca-Cola Japan’s Georgia line of canned coffee is still the No. 1 seller, which is interesting considering the company had a hard time initially selling the idea of canned coffee to its parent company back in Atlanta (hence the name). Back in the ’70s, one of Coca-Cola Japan’s regional distributors came out with one of the first canned coffees, Max, and when it tried to expand the brand, Coca-Cola in America wouldn’t subsidize it because it couldn’t understand the concept of coffee in a can. But when Max took off, the parent gave in and Georgia was born, as well as the whole canned coffee culture in Japan. Boss, which Suntory launched in 1992, is now the second-biggest-selling line, and the company has invested a lot in trying to overtake Coca-Cola. In 2000, Boss sales were about a third of Georgia’s. Now they’re about two-thirds. The beverage industry research company Inryo Soken says that Coca-Cola Japan has a 27.6 percent share of the overall soft drink market, with Suntory at 20.5 percent and Asahi Soft Drinks Co. at 12.9 percent. Last year, Suntory reported ¥1.26 trillion in sales and says it is aiming to increase that figure to ¥20 trillion by 2020. If Suntory is going to achieve that number it will presumably have to get more of its products into vending machines, whether they are owned by Suntory or not. That means negotiating with independent distributors who fill vending machines for people who place them on their property to make money, or finding more places to install their own machines, which now means going indoors. Building management companies are the main target of vending machine distributors and beverage companies. For individuals and firms with choice locations, vending machines require no startup money. The distributor or maker provides the machines and services them. Usually the property owner only has to pay for the electricity, and earns a cut of the profits, which can be as much as ¥50,000 a month per machine depending on demand. In order to make vending machines more attractive to property owners, distributors and makers have gotten vending machine manufacturers to make them more energy-efficient and compact.",

    "source": "Shima has high hopes for long-term windfall from G-7 meet <eos> Just before departing for this year’s Group of Seven summit in Germany earlier this month, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that Shima, situated at the end of a peninsula in Mie Prefecture, will be the main venue for next year’s annual gathering. The announcement elated local residents, because the short but lucrative G-7 summit, slated for May, is expected to give a shot in the arm to the region, which, like many other rural areas in Japan, has a rapidly shrinking and graying population. Abe named it the Ise-Shima Summit, after the area that includes the cities of Ise, where Japan’s top Shinto shrine stands, and Shima, where the summit will be held. The other candidates sites were Karuizawa in Nagano Prefecture, Sendai, Niigata, Hamamatsu in Shizuoka Prefecture, Nagoya, Kobe and Hiroshima. Why did Abe pick Shima? It is widely believed the Ise-Shima region was chosen because of its manageable security environment and Abe’s personal attachment to Ise Shrine. Kashikojima Island, which is expected to be the main venue, is a tiny resort in Ago Bay linked to the mainland by only two bridges and a railway. This makes it relatively easy to restrict and check incoming and outgoing traffic, experts say. Ise Shrine, which dates back around 2,000 years and is dedicated to the ancestral deities of the Imperial family, is one of the most sacred Shinto sites in Japan. In the Edo Period, it was the destination of pilgrimages from all over the nation, and prime ministers customarily visit the shrine in early January to offer prayers to kick off the new year. Abe said he hopes to take the leaders of the other G-7 nations — the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Canada and Italy — to see the shrine and share its serene atmosphere with them. Was Shima the prime candidate? No. Shima was not even a candidate at first. But after encouraged by Abe’s aides, it raised its hand to join the contest to be the main venue several months after the government’s deadline as an exception. Abe also reportedly considered using Hiroshima and Sendai. There was widespread speculation in the domestic media that by holding the summit in Hiroshima, Abe would be able to pressure the president of the United States to visit the site of the city destroyed by the world’s first atom bomb, sending powerful nuclear abolition message that would win him votes just before the crucial Upper House election that summer. However, Abe reportedly dropped the idea due to reservations expressed by other countries, including the U.S. Instead, Tokyo is now considering holding the G-7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Hiroshima. Sendai was a potential candidate because it was one of the many areas in the Tohoku region heavily damaged by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Where has Japan hosted the summit in the past? Japan hosted its first three G-7 summits in Tokyo. It then held the 2000 summit in Okinawa and the 2008 summit in the town of Toyako, Hokkaido, reflecting a recent trend of using remote, less-populated resorts to thwart protesters and improve security. Okinawa was chosen because the late Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was said to have had strong emotional attachment to the prefecture. Bill Clinton, who attended the Okinawa summit, became the first U.S. president to visit Okinawa since the war-battered island reverted to Japanese control in 1972. As for the 2008 summit, Toyako was a strong candidate early on because the picturesque resort, centered on a lake in nature-rich southwestern Hokkaido, made it easier to provide security for the leaders. What are the economic benefits of hosting the event? Even though the political influence of the G-7 meetings is said to be waning, many experts say the economic impact on the host countries remains large. The Hyakugo Economic Research Institute, an arm of a Mie-based bank, estimates the summit’s economic impact on Japan could reach about ¥51 billion, including ¥13 billion for Mie alone. Of the ¥51 billion, ¥7.4 billion is expected to come from an increase in accommodations and dining, and ¥2 billion from construction work. For the 2008 Toyako Hokkaido summit, the Hokkaido Economic Federation estimated the event would generate a sustained economic impact of about ¥28 billion for five years afterward. But others said the windfall didn’t last that long, considering tourism to Toyako sank from 3.38 million in 2007 to about 2.24 million in 2012. How much will the Ise-Shima summit cost? No one knows, but the Hyakugo research institute estimates the overall budget will come to around ¥27 billion. The think tank said the cost can be reduced by using existing facilities instead of building new ones. The cost of holding the event will be shared by the central and local governments. Although the ratio is not yet known, Mie Gov. Eikei Suzuki said at the news conference after Abe’s announcement on June 5 that he believed Mie’s burden would not exceed the roughly ¥1.5 billion Hokkaido paid for the 2008 summit. Japan has drawn flak from the public and its G-7 peers in the past for splurging on the summit and related events, handing out extravagant souvenirs, such as wine glasses and lacquered letter boxes, to participants and journalists alike. For example, the cost of the 2000 Kyushu and Okinawa summit reached an eye-popping ¥80 billion. Given the backlash, the government aimed to hold a “compact and effective” summit in 2008, using an existing hotel and facilities in Hokkaido. Even so, the total budget came to around ¥37 billion. About half the cost was reportedly used for security and counterterrorism measures. What are the local governments in Mie hoping to get out of the summit? As Shima is no exception to Japan’s rural depopulation trend, it is aiming to use the summit to revitalize the area by heavily promoting the region and increasing tourism, and hopefully residents as well. Shima is among the 869 municipalities that the Japan Policy Council, a Tokyo-based think tank, recently said were at risk of “disappearing” in the near future due to fewer births. The list accounts for about half of all the municipalities in Japan. Shima’s population stood at around 53,000 in May, compared with 63,000 in 1995.",

    "source": "Prince Harry sees carcasses of poached rhino, calf in 'major killing field' South African park <eos> JOHANNESBURG - Britain’s Prince Harry saw the carcasses of a slaughtered rhino and her calf during a visit Wednesday to South Africa’s Kruger National Park, which has been hard hit by poachers. Harry also stepped into a conservation debate in South Africa, saying he believes legalization of the rhino horn trade will “accelerate the path to extinction” for the threatened species. He said poachers have killed 1,500 rhinos in South Africa so far this year. He did not cite a source for the number, which would exceed last year’s record number of slaughtered rhinos by several hundred. The South African government said in late August that about 750 rhinos had been poached in 2015. Poachers have turned Kruger into “a major killing field,” said the British prince, who spent three months this year on conservation projects in Southern Africa. He accompanied rangers who inspected the carcasses of the rhino and her calf, searching for DNA and other evidence that might eventually be used in the prosecution of suspected poachers. The carcasses had already been picked over by vultures and other scavengers. “You have to try to get to the carcass as quickly as possible to suck up all the evidence before the wilds of Africa take it,” the prince said. Last week, a South African judge rescinded a moratorium on the domestic trade in rhino horns; the ban will stay in place pending an appeal by South Africa’s environment ministry. “It’s not for me to second guess a court or the legal reasons behind its decision, but what I strongly believe is that the legalization of rhino horn trading will accelerate the path to extinction,” Harry said. An international ban on the rhino horn trade has been in place since 1977. South Africa is home to most of the world’s rhinos.",

    "source": "Probe launched over abrupt change in MSDF's next chopper pick <eos> A special unit under the defense minister is investigating whistleblower information that the Maritime Self-Defense Force’s preferred choice for its next-generation utility helicopters, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani admitted Friday. Although the minister declined to elaborate, ministry sources said Thursday that the MSDF’s preferred choice has been improperly changed by the brass at the Maritime Staff Office from the model proposed by officials in charge. “To ensure fairness in the procedure, a defense inspection is under way,” Nakatani told a news conference, while stressing, “It is not because any irregularities or scandal have been confirmed.” “We are hoping to invite tenders in a manner in which fairness can be demonstrated,” he added. According to the sources, officials in charge of the selection had proposed a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. SH series model, part of the same line as the UH-60J choppers now in use. But the choice was later changed to the MCH series of Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. by the brass at the Maritime Staff Office, the sources said. The selection process has been suspended due to the probe by the Inspector General’s Office of Legal Compliance, launched in 2007 following a bid-rigging scandal over defense procurement. The inspector general is a former superintending public prosecutor. MSDF Chief of Staff Adm. Tomohisa Takei declined comment on the probe when contacted by Kyodo News, saying he is “not in a position to take questions” about such a special inspection and adding the MSDF “is currently taking the equipment selection procedure carefully, giving heed to compliance.” While the UH-60J is used for rescue operations, its successors are expected to be borne aboard escort ships, the sources said.",

    "source": "A quick lesson on sexual harassment in schools <eos> When you find criticism of your country disturbing, the best way to dismiss it is to find a flaw in the critique and use it to justify dismissing the rest of the evidence as well. Sometimes it works, but only if people don’t really do their homework. Take, for example, sukūru sekuhara, which means “school sexual harassment” and refers to academic staff acting lewdly toward their students. Such behavior ranges from inappropriate touching and sexual assault to photographing students naked. According to the education ministry, 205 faculty members at public schools were disciplined or fired for such offenses in fiscal year 2013, the most recent year statistics have been made public. It’s the first time since the survey began in 1977 that the figure has topped 200. It has hovered around 150 for the past decade. All academic employees who were disciplined were men and almost 70 percent of the harassment occurred outside of school hours. The offenses ranged from inappropriate physical contact, sexual intercourse, hidden filming, voyeurism, kissing, sexually offensive comics and literature, lewd photography, molestation and exposing private parts. The most common offense — in 56 cases — was inappropriate physical contact followed by taking unauthorized video footage and voyeurism. Thirty faculty members had sexual intercourse with their students. Two teachers were disciplined for selling and/or distributing pornographic videos. Two academic employees were disciplined for taking lewd photos of students in 2013. The Metropolitan Police Department recently arrested a 38-year-old elementary school teacher in Mitaka, Tokyo, for a similar offense. According to the Sankei Shimbun, the teacher had been suspected of inappropriately touching female students and, as a result, had been put in charge of a class of male students this year. The teacher was arrested on suspicion of taking a male student off school grounds in May and taking lewd photographs of him. The Mitaka City Board of Education faces public criticism for not disciplining the teacher earlier, but this does not appear to be unusual. The 2013 statistics show that inappropriate behavior was only discovered after the police contacted the school in almost a third of all cases of sexual harassment. The failure of academic institutions to recognize the abuse of children reflects a wider problem. In October, Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, special rapporteur for the U.N. on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography condemned the country’s failure to address the sexual exploitation of children at a news conference in Tokyo. “We have in Japan many forms of sexual exploitation of children, (some of) which are not necessarily criminalized,” she said. In particular, de Boer-Buquicchio pointed to the phenomena of enjo kosai (compensated dating), in which female high school students offer a range of services, such as going on walks, posing for photographs or performing sexual services in exchange for products or cash. De Boer-Buquicchio did welcome recent moves to criminalize the ownership of child pornography — the kind of material that was allegedly taken by the teacher in Mitaka. However, she said convictions typically result in suspended sentences or minimal penalties such as fines. “Even if the criminals are convicted, the sentences are extremely low,” she said. “The whole atmosphere of impunity needs to change.” The government statistics on sexual harassment in schools are very solid, but they may only be the tip of the iceberg. Unfortunately, however, de Boer-Buquicchio quoted an unnamed source as saying that some 13 percent of the schoolgirls in Japan were involved in compensated dating. The Foreign Ministry immediately protested the remarks and called for the comment to be retracted. In response, de Boer-Buquicchio said she had referred to estimates in open sources to highlight the problem. A short time later, however, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said de Boer-Buquicchio had sent the government a letter in which she effectively retracted her earlier claim. Numerous attempts to contact de Boer-Buquicchio have yet to confirm this. The government may be able to refute a number but not ignore a problem altogether. Japan needs to improve sex education in schools so that students can recognize healthy sexual relationships without selling their bodies or accepting abuse. Japan’s public spending on education as a percentage of GDP was the lowest among OECD countries in 2012, the sixth consecutive year it sat at the bottom. Sexual harassment in schools may be just another sign of getting what you pay for: If you don’t fund education, don’t pay enough to hire good teachers and don’t tackle abuse, you could learn a few unpleasant things.",
