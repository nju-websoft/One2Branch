    "source": "For Donald Trump’s Big Speech, an Added Pressure: No Echoes <eos> CLEVELAND — Until Monday night, Donald J. Trump’s biggest concern about his convention speech was how much to reveal about himself and his family in an address that is often the most personal one a presidential candidate delivers. But the political firestorm over his wife’s speech , which borrowed passages from Michelle Obama’s convention remarks in 2008, raised the stakes exponentially. Mr. Trump’s speech on Thursday night cannot merely be his best ever. It also has to be bulletproof. By Tuesday morning, word had spread throughout his campaign that any language in Mr. Trump’s address even loosely inspired by speeches, essays, books or Twitter posts had to be either rewritten or attributed. Mr. Trump’s chief speechwriter, Stephen Miller, reassured colleagues that the acceptance speech was wholly original, according to two staff members who spoke with him and described those conversations on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Miller also told campaign aides that he had looked closely at passages that Mr. Trump had contributed — handwritten on unlined white pages — and was confident they contained no problems. (Mr. Miller declined an interview request.) Even so, one of the staff members downloaded plagiarism-detection software and ran a draft of the speech through the program. No red flags came up. The intense scrutiny of Mr. Trump’s words added new pressure to a speechwriting process that has been one of the most unpredictable and free-form in modern presidential campaigns. A month ago, Mr. Trump began giving dictation on themes for the speech, and he tossed ideas and phrases to Mr. Miller or other advisers on a daily basis. On printed copies of each draft, he circled passages he liked, crossed out or put question marks beside lines that he did not favor and frequently suggested new words or phrases.

Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times “I’ve been amending the drafts big-league,” Mr. Trump said in an interview in his Manhattan office before the convention. “I get ideas from a lot of different places, a lot of smart people, but mostly I like language that sounds like me.” Yet in the aftermath of Melania Trump’s speech, campaign advisers have fretted that they do not know for sure where Mr. Trump gets his ideas and language — whether they are his own, in other words, or are picked up from Twitter, television, or, say, a best seller by Bill O’Reilly of Fox News, a commentator whom Mr. Trump likes. Borrowing or adapting may not always be tantamount to plagiarism, but several Trump advisers, who also insisted on anonymity, said that after the furor over Ms. Trump’s remarks, the campaign cannot allow a similar blowup. Ed Rollins, a Republican strategist who is advising a “super PAC” supporting Mr. Trump, said that the candidate could not afford any mistakes. “His speech is the whole game,” Mr. Rollins said. “Viewers have to watch it and say, ‘There is the next president of the United States.’” In the interview, Mr. Trump said his speech would center on his vision of a strong and secure America that “once existed and no longer does, but can again under a Trump administration.” Latest Election Polls 2016 Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. His greatest challenge, he said, was “putting myself in the speech” — discussing his upbringing and early experiences and relating them to the hopes and aspirations of other Americans. “I was never comfortable getting personal about my family because I thought it was special territory,” Mr. Trump said, glancing at a picture of his father on his desk. “It can feel exploitative to use family stories to win votes. And I had a very happy and comfortable life growing up. I had a great relationship with my father. But my focus needs to be on all the Americans who are struggling.” He said he was unsure if he would discuss his older brother Fred, who died as an alcoholic in 1981 at 43 — and whom he has described as an example of how destructive choices can damage lives that seem golden. “Without my brother Fred I might not be here,” Mr. Trump said. “He was really smart, great-looking. I don’t drink or smoke because of what happened to him. I focused on building my business and making good choices. I may talk about that, but I don’t know if I should.” Acceptance speeches seldom seem complete without anecdotes about personal trials and triumphs: Mitt Romney, trying to persuade voters to see him as more than a rich businessman, devoted about a fourth of his 2012 address to his parents’ unconditional love, his Mormon faith and reminiscences about watching the moon landing. In 2008 , Barack Obama described how his grandfather benefited from the G.I. Bill and how his mother and grandmother taught him the value of hard work. And Bill Clinton’s 1992 speech vividly recalled the life lessons he learned from his mother about fighting and working hard, from his grandfather about racial equality — and from his wife, Hillary, who, Mr. Clinton said, taught him that every child could learn. Mr. Clinton finished his speech with a now-famous line tying his Arkansas hometown to the American dream. “I end tonight where it all began for me,” he said. “I still believe in a place called Hope.” James Carville, a senior strategist for Mr. Clinton’s 1992 campaign, said that if Mr. Trump hoped to change the minds of those who see him as divisive or bigoted, he would need to open himself up to voters in meaningfully personal ways in his speech. “If he’s really different than the way he seems in television interviews or at his rallies, Thursday’s speech will be his single greatest opportunity to show voters who he really is,” Mr. Carville said. Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman, said that Thursday’s speech would be “very much a reflection of Mr. Trump’s own words, as opposed to remarks that others create and the campaign puts in his mouth.” “He’s not an editor — he is actually the creator of the speech,” Mr. Manafort said. “Mr. Trump has given Steve Miller and I very specific directions about how he views the speech, what he wants to communicate, and ways to tie together things that he has been talking about in the campaign. The speech will end up being tone-perfect because the speech’s words will be his words.” Mr. Trump prefers speaking off the cuff with handwritten notes, a style that has proved successful at his rallies, where he has shown a talent for connecting with and electrifying crowds. But his adjustment to formal speeches remains a work in progress: He does not always sound like himself, and reading from a text can detract from the sense of authenticity that his supporters prize. One question is whether, or how much, he will ad-lib. He has sometimes seemed unable to resist deviating from prepared remarks, often to ill effect — ranting about a mosquito , or joking that a passing airplane was from Mexico and was “ getting ready to attack .” “Ad-libbing is instinct, all instinct,” Mr. Trump said. “I thought maybe about doing a freewheeling speech for the convention, but that really wouldn’t work. But even with a teleprompter, the speech will be me — my ideas, my beliefs, my words.”",

    "source": "In Home Opener, Rangers Lose Gaborik and Drury to Injuries <eos> There were silver linings to the Rangers ’ wild 4-3 overtime loss in their home opener at Madison Square Garden on Friday night. But the clouds they lined were huge, dark and ominous. Marian Gaborik left the game with a separated left shoulder in the second period after being boarded by Toronto’s Colby Armstrong. Gaborik, whose 42 goals led the Rangers last season, will be out of action for at least two weeks, Rangers Coach John Tortorella said after the game. Chris Drury also left with an injury in the second period after colliding with his teammate Michal Rozsival and falling into the boards. Drury, making his season debut after missing the first two games with a broken left index finger, broke the same finger in a different place. He will be out six weeks, Tortorella said. Vinny Prospal, the Rangers’ No. 2 scorer last season, will be operated on Tuesday to repair the right knee that has prevented him from playing so far this season. Tortorella said Prospal would be out indefinitely. The silver linings could be found in the Rangers’ ability to rally from a 3-1 second-period deficit, as well as a 30-12 shooting deficit, to tie the Leafs at the end of regulation and salvage a point in the standings. The star of the game for the Rangers was Brian Boyle, who scored both goals. Boyle, the fourth-line center, scored only four times in 71 games last season. But he was given extra shifts because of the injuries to Gaborik and Drury, and he made the most of the opportunity. “It’s great to get into the rhythm of a game,” Boyle said. “To get called on a few more times, that was a good feeling.” Henrik Lundqvist also deserved credit for the point, stopping 34 of 38 shots from the Leafs, who are now 4-0 — their best start since 1993-94. The Rangers are 1-1-1. “I’m happy about our resiliency, getting a point after not doing what we needed to do through the first two periods,” Tortorella said. “We’ll take the point.” Brandon Dubinsky tried to dwell on the positive, saying, “We found a way to come back from two goals and create something positive.” But the clouds cast a shadow over any positive developments. Particularly troubling was the second period, when the Rangers were overwhelmed and surrendered three unanswered goals. “They were screaming through the neutral zone,” Tortorella said of the Leafs. “We couldn’t catch them. I can’t believe they’re that quick.” Clarke MacArthur, Mike Komisarek and Phil Kessel scored for Toronto, all on plays that involved rushes down ice with Rangers chasing in futility. The Rangers also lost Gaborik and Drury in the second period. But their rally in the third tied the score thanks to Boyle and Sean Avery, who had about as mixed a game as any player can have. He had two assists, including the setup on the Boyle goal that tied the score, and went plus-3. Avery also took two needless penalties — one in which he dropped his gloves to fight Armstrong, who had not dropped his, and another in which he needlessly slashed Komisarek across the back of the legs during a stoppage in play. “Sean gave us some effective minutes,” Tortorella said. “But that’s where we’re going to have to continue working with him. He has to realize there are different ways to accomplish that.” Boyle’s goals, Lundqvist’s saves and the Rangers’ six penalty kills got them to overtime. But then the Rangers surrendered a seventh power play, after Marc Staal was penalized for interfering with Tim Brent. Kessel scored his second goal of the game on the ensuing advantage, 3 minutes 8 seconds into the overtime session. Tortorella said he was frustrated by Staal’s taking an unnecessary penalty. Now the Rangers — who have managed to avoid injury trouble the last two seasons — must figure out how to plug the holes opened by the loss of Gaborik and Drury. Erik Christensen, recovered from a groin pull, should be ready to take Drury’s place at center. Todd White may dress to take another vacant forward position, or the Rangers may try to call up Tim Kennedy, recently demoted to Hartford in the American Hockey League. But they could easily lose him to waivers, as he carries only a $275,000 cap hit for any claiming team. That is another big cloud hovering over the Rangers.",

    "source": "The Role of Politics in Wealth Distribution <eos> MITT ROMNEY has apologized for his depiction of 47 percent of America as wealth takers rather than wealth makers. But his blunder touched inadvertently on some discomforting truths about the importance of politics in income distribution in the United States. If Mr. Romney’s points were to be reformulated in a more defensible direction, the outline might look something like this: OF MAKING AND TAKING The correct distinction is not “makers versus takers.” The problem is that taking, rather than making wealth, appears to be growing in relative influence. Most of us are actually both makers and takers. Consider farmers who produce food and favor agricultural subsidies. The question is whether the role of wealth maker has more influence over our politics, at any given time, than does the taker role. Is public policy being adjudicated on grounds of ethics and efficiency, or is the real story about lobbying and the relative power of different interest groups? It isn’t easy to measure whether politics is less public-spirited these days, and we should resist the tendency to idealize the past. Still, job creation, median income and other measures of economic well-being have done poorly since the late 1990s. That suggests that America isn’t paying enough attention to creating wealth and increasing general prosperity. FOLLOW THE MONEY Seven of the 10 most affluent counties in the nation are near Washington, D.C. That means a growing number of educated people are making a very good living advising, lobbying and otherwise influencing the federal government. This is a talent drain. It’s far from obvious that we are getting better policy as a result, and true wealth creation has not kept pace. As Matthew Yglesias, a columnist for the online magazine Slate, has pointed out, there is also a subtler point about those wealthy Virginia and Maryland counties. They have high per capita incomes, not only because they attract educated, government-oriented professionals, but also because their zoning and building codes limit the supply of low-cost housing. That’s a significant government intervention that hurts lower-income people, who must pay more. Privilege-seeking through government is often most pernicious when it has a tidy front and a well-manicured green lawn. UNEQUAL INFLUENCE Politics based on lobbying stacks the deck against lower-income groups, who are often outmaneuvered. For instance, one of the biggest problems faced by the poor today is inadequate K-12 education. They need improved public schools, more school choice, or some mix of both. Over time, such improvements would help deal with many other social and economic issues, including global competitiveness, domestic unemployment, public health and the budget deficit, because quality education has many beneficial effects. Instead, the current system of transfers offers to the poor various sops in place of more effective reforms. Fundamental improvements to education would involve more challenging changes to residential zoning, teacher unions and certification systems, and might also take some educational finance and control out of the hands of local municipalities. It is no surprise that well-off families want to keep a system that has done very well by them, and that the poor often lose political battles over education. EVERYONE FEELS ENTITLED People tend to think that they have justice on their side, whether it comes to making or taking. For example, millions of homeowners have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the premise that the tax deduction for mortgages will be continued. If they support a continuation of that deduction they hardly feel like brigands, even though a bipartisan consensus of economists doubts the efficiency of this tax break. As years and decades pass, recipients of this deduction and other benefits start to see them as deeply and richly deserved. Furthermore, almost all of us reap one or more of these benefits, so few individuals are consistently opposed to all government transfers. It becomes difficult for a politician to articulate exactly what is wrong with this arrangement when the audience itself is in on the game and perhaps does not want to hear about its own takings. A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE The Founding Fathers were extremely worried about the threat to society posed by corruption and privilege-seeking. Drawing on examples going back to antiquity, they understood how unmitigated wealth-taking could create a negative and cumulatively self-reinforcing political dynamic. They also understood that the Constitution — or any constitution — would be an extremely imperfect remedy for this problem.  It is therefore correct to reject Mr. Romney’s depiction as off-base and misleading. Yet the fact that he didn’t present the truth is an indication that the problem is actually worse than many of us realize.",

    "source": "Timofey Mozgov of the Knicks Helps Russia at Worlds <eos> ANKARA, Turkey — An international scout for the last 15 years, Kevin Wilson said that no matter how politically incorrect it is, he engages in profiling when analyzing European players. When scouting Russians, Wilson acknowledged, he casts a skeptical eye. Too often, he said, they have a poor work ethic and lack mental toughness. It is a stereotype that the Russian national team coach, David Blatt, said stemmed from a rule in the lucrative professional leagues there that requires teams to have two Russians on the floor at all times. But the back story of Timofey Mozgov, who signed with the Knicks in July , belies that of a typical player in the Russian system, which tends to usher top young players to pro teams and coddle them. Mozgov, 24, is an athletic 7-foot-1 late bloomer whose performance for Russia during pool play at the world championships has been one of the surprises of the tournament. Coming off the bench behind the former Kansas star Sasha Kaun, Mozgov scored 18 points in Russia’s victory over Greece on Thursday, has averaged 11.8 points over all and has helped lead a Russian team without any N.B.A. players to a 4-1 record. “I think it’s going to be easier for him in the N.B.A. than in Europe,” Blatt said. “He’s not going to have to be a lead player, and they’ll probably put him in a small area of the game where he has to pick and cut or run the break hard, which he does extremely well. “Still, it’s going to be a big adjustment for Timofey.” If Russia beats France and the United States beats Angola in knockout-round games Monday, the teams will play Thursday . The game would give N.B.A. players their first significant look at Mozgov. Last week in Ankara, he looked like a polished passer in Blatt’s hybrid Princeton offense and showed a soft touch on his jump shot. Tapping in putbacks against Ivory Coast is easier than boxing out his childhood idol, Kevin Garnett, but there are certain things that will not be lost in translation. “You can’t teach what he has — body, size and athletic ability,” said Tony Ronzone, the director of international player personnel for USA Basketball. “They’re hard to find in the world.” Mozgov said he was excited at the opportunity to come to the N.B.A. and described his only visit to New York as crazy. He said he planned on moving to New York with his girlfriend but did not know where he was going to live. Mozgov said he had been learning more English to help ease his adjustment, and at a recent interview he used an interpreter only about half the time. “I will have to prove myself, and I will try and show the coach that I can play,” he said. He added with a smile, “Because I want to play.” How much Mozgov plays will depend on his adjustment on and off the floor. Wilson said Mozgov was “kind of a maverick” by Russian basketball standards. He started playing late, never signed with a powerhouse Russian club and avoided signing with a Russian agent. Having to fight to be noticed helped him forge his work ethic. Mozgov spent most of his childhood near Krasnodar, a small agricultural city about 100 miles from the Black Sea. His family moved there from St. Petersburg, he said, because his father had health problems. The youngest of four brothers, Mozgov grew up in a working-class family. He said his father worked as a driver for a private company and his mother stayed at home to raise the family. “His family is definitely blue collar,” Wilson said. “He’s never had money, and he’s not money conscious the way a lot of poor kids are. That’s another thing that I like about him.” It is common in Europe for top youth players to sign with pro teams at young ages. But Mozgov said he did not start playing basketball seriously until age 15 when he went to a boarding school in St. Petersburg at the suggestion of a local coach. “I was playing only in my school, and it wasn’t a school that prepared me for basketball,” he said. That trip matured Mozgov’s game and also helped him handle his older brother, who he said roughed him around while growing up. “When I left and studied, and after my year I came back, my brothers couldn’t do anything,” he said with a smile. Mozgov never signed with a powerhouse Russian team like Dynamo Moscow or CSKA Moscow. He also did not play a lot for his club team, B.C. Khimki. Blatt said that Mozgov did not play much more than 15 minutes a game last year and compared him to a young pilot needing flight time. “His adjustment will be bigger than most, but his upside is great,” Blatt said. “I’m looking forward to Timofey making the jump. It’s not going to be easy for him. If he works hard and the New York people help him, he’s got a good chance to do something.” Part of Mozgov’s value to the Knicks is as an athletic big man who can alleviate some of the pounding that Amar’e Stoudemire, their prized free-agent signing , will take in the post. But to trade elbows with N.B.A. centers, Mozgov will need to continue to fill out his 269-pound frame. Because his most polished skill is his ability to use his athleticism to run the break, it is easy to see how he fits into Coach Mike D’Antoni’s up-tempo system. From his limited time working out Mozgov and seeing him on tape, D’Antoni said he was impressed with his ability to shoot the 15-footer, play pick-and-roll and run the floor. But he called Mozgov’s hands average and cautioned that success in individual workouts and Europe did not always translate to the N.B.A. “This kid, I’m excited about him; I want to see him play five on five,” D’Antoni said. “But what we saw of him working out, we’re excited. We think he can be really good.” He added, “He can be a good bookend with Amar’e. I do worry about his defense a little bit.” Mozgov signed a three-year deal with the Knicks worth about $9 million, but his impact may not be felt immediately. A classic late bloomer, Mozgov will need time to mature in New York. “He’s very raw, and he needs a lot of work,” said Wilson, the Knicks’ director of international scouting. “It’s unfair to him or anyone else to expect he’s a superstar out of the gate. “The best thing is if he could progress from a 5-minute guy to a 15-minute guy. If he can warrant being on the floor from 15 to 18 minutes, I think that would be a great first season for him.”",

    "source": "Craig Spencer, New York Doctor With Ebola, Will Leave Bellevue Hospital <eos> Craig Spencer, the New York City doctor who became the first person in the city to test positive for Ebola, is free of the virus and is set to be released from Bellevue Hospital Center on Tuesday, hospital officials said on Monday. Dr. Spencer, 33, who had been in Guinea treating Ebola patients with Doctors Without Borders, was rushed to Bellevue by ambulance on Oct. 23 after reporting a fever of 100.3 to the authorities that morning. He was placed in isolation in a secure ward, and within hours a blood test confirmed he had the virus. His infection set the city on edge and set off a race to find his contacts over the previous few days, when he went bowling , dined out and rode on the subway and in an Uber taxi. But to date, no one else in the city has tested positive for the virus. Dr. Spencer is scheduled to appear at a news conference on Tuesday at the hospital. Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for Bellevue, said in a statement that “after a rigorous course of treatment and testing,” Dr. Spencer posed “no public health risk.” It was unclear on Monday whether Dr. Spencer would return to his Hamilton Heights apartment, where his fiancée, Morgan Dixon , is under quarantine. Two friends who had contact with him in the days before his diagnosis were initially held in quarantine, but were recently released. Dr. Spencer was given a range of treatments, including an experimental drug and blood plasma donated by a recovered Ebola patient, Nancy Writebol , a 59-year-old missionary who contracted the virus in Liberia. His condition was serious at first, but by last week, he had recovered enough that he asked for, and was given, his banjo and an exercise bicycle to pass the time while he was in isolation. Dr. Spencer’s recovery adds to the evidence that when treated in advanced American hospitals, Ebola has a far lower fatality rate than in West African field hospitals starved of doctors, nurses and equipment. While 70 percent of Ebola patients in Africa are dying, eight of the nine patients treated in the United States have survived. The only one who died was Thomas Eric Duncan , a Liberian, whose treatment was delayed when a Dallas hospital initially misdiagnosed his illness. The experience of the Dallas hospital — two nurses who treated Mr. Duncan there contracted Ebola, but survived — caused American hospitals and public health officials to re-examine how they responded to possible cases. Requirements for protective gear were revamped, and when Dr. Spencer was taken to Bellevue, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dispatched a team to New York even before tests confirmed he had the virus. In Dallas, the C.D.C. did not arrive until two days after it was called. A day after Dr. Spencer went to Bellevue, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that all travelers arriving in New York who had had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa would be quarantined for 21 days, even if they had no symptoms and thus were not likely to be contagious. That policy, which New Jersey and several other states also enacted, was criticized by some public health experts as an overreaction that would discourage doctors and nurses from traveling to Africa to help contain the virus. Mr. Cuomo said he preferred to err on the side of caution.",

    "source": "Bill Pascrell Defeats Steve Rothman in New Jersey <eos> PATERSON, N.J. — In a hard-fought race that pitted two Democrats and onetime friends against each other, Representative Bill Pascrell Jr. won the primary in the Ninth Congressional District on Tuesday. With 90 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Pascrell had 64 percent of the vote, beating Representative Steve Rothman, with 36 percent, according to The Associated Press. The Ninth District, in northern New Jersey, is one of a handful of newly shaped Congressional districts across the country with Democrats facing each other because of election maps redrawn after the 2010 census. The race was exceptional in that one of the candidates, Mr. Rothman, moved in order to challenge a fellow Democrat. And not just any Democrat, but one with whom he had shared dinners and commutes to Washington over 16 years together in Congress. A result was the kind of bitter campaign usually seen between two parties, with negative advertising, furious accusations of betrayal and voter suppression, and visits from prominent surrogates. Mr. Pascrell had a rally on Friday with former President Bill Clinton. And Mr. Rothman, the first in New Jersey’s delegation to endorse Barack Obama in 2008, campaigned with the president’s chief political adviser, David Axelrod. Taking the gymnasium stage to the theme song from “Rocky” at Passaic County Community College, Mr. Pascrell, 75, began simply, “We did it!” and then theatrically rolled up the sleeves of his white dress shirt. “My parents always told me not to start fights, but to know how to end them,” he said. “Tonight, we did just that.” In the nearby 10th District, which includes Newark, Donald M. Payne Jr. won a six-way race for the seat left open by the death of his father in March. His closest contenders were Nia Gill, a state senator who asked voters to make her the only woman in the state’s Congressional delegation, and Ron Rice Jr., who serves on the Newark Municipal Council, of which Mr. Payne is president. In November, Mr. Pascrell will face the winner of the Republican primary on Tuesday, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, the author of “Kosher Sex” and a memoir of his time as spiritual adviser to Michael Jackson. Rabbi Boteach won a three-way race. But the district heavily favors the Democrat in the general election, and the party’s primary had become the state’s most closely watched campaign. Mr. Pascrell’s victory was a triumph of assiduous retail politicking and an aggressive get-out-the-vote effort, particularly in his hometown, Paterson, the state’s third largest city. The demographics of the newly configured district favored Mr. Rothman. Just over half its residents had been in the district he represented before the lines were redrawn. In Bergen County, where most voters in the reshaped Ninth District live, Mr. Rothman had the so-called line, the party blessing that translates into a favorable ballot position, with his name alongside President Obama’s as the official Democratic candidate. But analysts warned all along against counting out Mr. Pascrell and his love for a street fight. His campaign pinned its hopes on increasing turnout in Paterson, a largely poor, immigrant city where he had been mayor. The campaign said it had registered 10,000 new Democrats there. That strategy appeared to have worked, with campaign operatives reporting high turnout in the city and relatively low turnout in Englewood, where Mr. Rothman was once mayor. The two men, both elected to Congress in 1996, began their battle after New Jersey’s redistricting commission, faced with eliminating one of the state’s 13 districts, moved Mr. Rothman’s home in Fair Lawn into the Fifth District, which has slightly favored Republicans. It is now represented by Scott Garrett, who is almost invariably labeled “a Tea Party darling” in local papers and blog posts. Mr. Pascrell, who has extensive political connections in the state — his former chief of staff was on the redistricting commission — was given the Ninth, a heavily Democratic district. Rather than run against Mr. Garrett, Mr. Rothman, 59, opted to move and run against Mr. Pascrell. This caused consternation for New Jersey Democrats who thought both men had served the state well in Congress, and for national Democrats, who were trying to win 25 House seats needed to retake the majority. The party’s Congressional leaders beseeched Mr. Rothman to challenge Mr. Garrett instead of one of his own, arguing that even if he lost, he would be a hero to the party should he decide to run for the United States Senate, as he has said he would like to. Mr. Pascrell relentlessly accused Mr. Rothman of being too weak to take on the real fight, against a conservative Republican. Mr. Rothman argued that much of the Ninth District included his former constituents — even if his house and district offices were in the Fifth. He argued he was “the Democrats’ Democrat,” trying to paint Mr. Pascrell as aligned with Republicans on health care, abortion and taxes. But the two largest newspapers in the district, The Star-Ledger of Newark and The Record of Hackensack, both endorsed Mr. Pascrell. They criticized Mr. Rothman for fighting against a fellow Democrat rather than a Republican, and for running misleading ads that edited footage to suggest Mr. Pascrell had supported Republican positions on taxes.",

The website of The Legal Daily, an official newspaper, said on Friday that the police detained Mr. Jiang when he tried to travel to Beijing by train from Changsha, a city in southern China. They accused him of using a fake identity card to buy a ticket. After he was in custody, much graver charges were lodged: Citing the police, the newspaper said Mr. Jiang “illegally possessed multiple secret state documents, colluded with overseas institutions, organizations and individuals, and is suspected of illegally providing state secrets abroad.” It appears likely that Mr. Jiang, 45, will join a long list of Chinese rights advocates who have been detained, discredited and in some cases imprisoned as a warning to others not to embrace dissent. About 250 lawyers and activists were detained in the crackdown last year. Most were released, but about 17 were arrested and in some cases tried and imprisoned on subversion and other charges, according to estimates by Amnesty International. The Legal Daily said Mr. Jiang was a “citizen advocate” who “meddled in some serious cases, wantonly fabricated and spread rumors on the internet, and incited petitioners and the families of people in legal proceedings to resist state agencies.” Patrick Poon, who researches Chinese issues for Amnesty International from Hong Kong, said in an interview that “without access to a lawyer of his own choice, Jiang Tianyong is at risk of torture or other ill treatment.” The Chinese news reports said Mr. Jiang had been held under “criminal coercive measures” since Dec. 1. Those measures give the police vaguely defined powers to hold suspects secretively. The reports said the police had notified Mr. Jiang’s family about his case. “That’s simply a lie,” Mr. Poon said. Mr. Jiang’s wife, Jin Bianling, who lives in California, denied in an emailed statement that his family had received any official notice. She said the authorities had concocted the allegations “to avenge and crush Jiang Tianyong’s long-running work in rights defense.”",

    "source": "At Brooklyn’s Fish Tales, Friendly People. Noses Agree. <eos> ONE of the first things you notice when walking into Fish Tales Gourmet Seafood Market is the smell. There is none. But the fish motif is definitely in the air, including walls strung with nets and traps and a whole fish mounted above the stained wainscot. The shotgun layout feels like the well-lighted hull of a boat. The bustling shop, near Court and Bergen Streets, leads to a pescatarian’s paradise, catering to home chefs and local restaurants. Between a tank with live lobsters and a freezer with frozen shellfish are racks stacked with sauces, seasonings, crackers, batters and peelers. Side-by-side coolers layered with house-prepared appetizers and salads sit opposite an assortment of smoked fish and caviar. A table piled with curled crustaceans is nearby. The corner spot, which fronts the busy but unseen kitchen, is a mountain of ice piled with clusters of sealed mussel and clam shells. And at the far end of the store are gourmet entrees and crocks of soups and chowders. But the highlight of Fish Tales is the colorful, fresh-cut fillets and whole fish — orange salmon, ruby tuna, china cod, opaque tilapia, striped bass, red snapper, speckled trout. The fish is so fresh and tenderly treated, it provides pleasure to the eyes with no impression on the nose. There’s a reason for this. The shop’s owner, John Addis, arises at 2 a.m. at his home on Staten Island to get to the Fulton Fish Market in the Bronx by 3. There, he spends two to three hours shopping for the best catch. After loading a refrigerated van, Mr. Addis is at the shop in Brooklyn around 6 to unload and to start filleting in preparation for a 9 a.m. opening. This is a neighborhood place run by neighborhood guys. Mr. Addis and his two longtime countermen, Lewis Spada and Alex Ortiz, provide high-end, exceptional service in a low-key, familiar way. They know names. They peel off plastic gloves to shake hands. Dialogue is constant and inclusive, but it’s not chatter; it’s conversation. And it usually revolves around fish and its preparation, which can easily become a group discussion among patrons and staff. After each purchase, customers are reminded to grab a few free lemons and to stop by the table near the door stacked with recipe print-outs. All three men work long hours, but their easy manners never tire. Over the years, Mr. Addis became a zealot for customer service. “I tell my guys, treat every customer the way you want your mother treated,” he said. Mr. Addis, a native of Bensonhurst, who has been in the restaurant business since childhood, became a partner in Fish Tales around 1998 and became the sole proprietor in 2001. When my wife and I moved to the area, we shopped there every other week or so. Mr. Addis knew my wife; he knew my name before I knew his. A few years later, we moved away, though I’d still pop in once or twice a year. By the time we moved back to the area, it had been almost five years since I had set foot in Fish Tales. The place was crowded and full of familiar conversations. I figured I had been forgotten. “Andrew,” Mr. Addis said without pause, peeling off his plastic glove to shake my hand. “How’s it going? How’s Pam?” It’s nice to be treated like somebody’s mother.",

Convicted of Sexual Attacks on 5 in Brooklyn <eos> An emergency medical technician with the Fire Department was convicted on Wednesday of a series of sexual assaults in Brooklyn, including an attack on an 11-year-old girl inside an elevator. The technician, Angus Pascall, 36, was convicted of first-degree rape, among other charges, for five separate attacks on young women and girls ages 11 to 22 stretching to 2001. Most of the assaults occurred in 2009 and 2010, the year he was arrested, the Kings County district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, said in a statement. Mr. Pascall’s lawyer, Edward Friedman, said his client would appeal the verdict. In each of the attacks, Mr. Pascall was armed, sometimes with a gun or a knife. In one attack on a 19-year-old woman in 2009, he used a machete, the district attorney said. In the assault on the 11-year-old, he used his emergency responder’s key to trap the victim inside an elevator. “Pascall then put a gun to her face and repeatedly sexually assaulted her,” according to the statement. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 13, and he faces up to life in prison. Mr. Pascall had worked for the Fire Department for five years when he was arrested in 2010.",

    "source": "Kaba Faces Suit Over Push-Button Locks Breached With Magnet <eos> Yeshai M. Kutoff was house-proud, having bought a home in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, for his family of five. And as an Orthodox Jew, he bought push-button locks for the doors — an accommodation for the Sabbath, when many of the devout do not carry keys. When a neighbor told him that the locks he had bought could be opened by a powerful magnet costing about $30, Mr. Kutoff was perturbed. “It does bother me that other people could easily figure it out,” he said. Mr. Kutoff did not buy a magnet to see for himself. “It doesn’t interest me to know how to break into my own lock,” he said. If this were a problem with security software instead of errant bits of steel, a company could send out a patch. If this was someplace other than the United States in the 21st century, Mr. Kutoff might have called a locksmith. But because it is the United States in the 21st century, lawyers are involved. And now, in a federal courthouse in Ohio, 11 lawsuits have been consolidated into one against Kaba, a lock industry leader whose Simplex push-button locks are used by hospitals, airports, casinos, banks, the Department of Defense and police departments. The company markets the locks as part of their “strong, powerful security solutions ” and calls the push-button locks vandal resistant ; the plaintiffs’ lawyers say otherwise. In fact, they accuse Kaba of deceptive trade practices, common-law fraud, negligence and product liability. They say the locks, which can cost less than $200 or more than $1,000, depending on the model, are defective by design. And they are demanding that the company replace the locks, pay compensatory damages and even turn over all profits made from the locks over the years. Plaintiffs’ briefs suggest that the class includes “hundreds of thousands of persons and entities,” and the case already involves some big players in the legal community, including Richard J. Arsenault and Daniel E. Becnel Jr. of Louisiana and Mark J. Geragos of Los Angeles. Mr. Arsenault, the co-lead counsel for plaintiffs in the litigation, called the locks insecure and said the problem was a “slow-motion disaster.” Mark P. Miller , a lawyer for Kaba, has argued in court that the plaintiffs’ lawyers were “fear-mongering,” and he ridiculed the lawsuits as “another Happy Meals case ” — a reference to a much-belittled class-action suit filed in California in December that accuses McDonald’s of using toys to lure children into unhealthy eating habits. In court filings, Kaba argued that it had “never advertised or warranted in any way that any of its access control products are impenetrable.” Locksmiths learn techniques to defeat all kinds of locks, and “thieves and others who want to defeat locks can obtain the same tools and learn the same techniques locksmiths use,” the filings said. “Indeed, any thief — even the most clumsy — can use a sledgehammer, a pry bar or bolt cutter to bypass essentially any lock.” In a statement, Mr. Miller added that the company had “never received any confirmed report of a break-in” because of a magnetic bypass, and that it heard about the potential for magnetic mischief only in August 2010. Kaba is preparing a free kit to modify the locks and make them magnet-proof, he said. In an earlier hearing in the case, Mr. Miller argued that beating a push-button lock was not as simple or easy as the plaintiffs claimed. “My own personal research shows that it takes a magnet the size of a bagel to get the locks open,” he said. In fact, the magnet required is only a couple of inches square, and a video shows the magnet alongside a bagel for comparison. Mr. Miller also argued in court that the magnet was unwieldy and too powerful for most people to use. “It’s a big, heavy thing that if you have it in your pocket, and you happen to walk by something that’s made out of metal, you will get stuck to it and have to call 911 to get your pants somehow removed to save yourself,” he said. This month, lawyers for the plaintiffs showed a video in court as an informal briefing for the judge that countered some of Mr. Miller’s contentions. The video shows someone sliding a magnet against a lock and removing it with one hand. The magnet pulls a locking plate away from the mechanism, allowing the door handle or knob to turn freely. Once the magnet has been removed, the narrator says, the plate slides back into place, and there is no evidence that the mechanism has been bypassed. To Mr. Arsenault, Kaba’s argument that no one has been harmed by the locks is a weak one. He said that “there’s no way to know that,” and that even if no one has yet been harmed, “it’s obviously irresponsible to wait for criminal activity to occur before warning the public and taking immediate corrective action.” As for the company’s proposed fix, he said, “the devil is in the details.” And while many might look askance at a lawsuit over locks, this is not the first. Kryptonite, the maker of distinctive U-shaped bicycle locks, settled a class-action lawsuit in 2004 when it was revealed that its cylindrical locks could be defeated with the barrel of a Bic pen. The company redesigned the locks and offered customers exchanges or vouchers. Marc Weber Tobias, an expert on locks and security who is not working for the lawyers in the Kaba case at this time but has met with them, said, “This is a serious deal and affects lots of agencies.” He wrote about the locks in his blog for Forbes.com after sending an alert to law enforcement agencies, security professionals and locksmiths. “This is a very significant issue, because they are playing a game of jeopardy with the protection of property and lives,” he said. Mr. Tobias acknowledged that brute force could defeat any lock. But he said: “Nobody is concerned about someone walking into an airport or bank or credit card facility with a sledgehammer or crowbar. They are concerned, however, about an unauthorized individual or criminal bypassing the security of a facility in two seconds, covertly, with a magnet.” Meanwhile, Mr. Kutoff said he would simply like to get his locks exchanged for something safer. “It’s something that everybody wants to do — put a good lock on your house,” he said. “In a perfect world, the locksmith doesn’t have a job,” Mr. Kutoff said. “But it’s not a perfect world.”",

    "source": "N.B.A. Playoffs — Celtics Rally Around Jason Collins <eos> WALTHAM, Mass. — Doc Rivers said he received a phone call a few days ago. On the other line was Jason Collins, who had appeared in 32 games for the Boston Celtics this season before being traded in February. The way Rivers, the Celtics coach, recalled it on Tuesday before his team left for New York for Game 5 of its playoff series with the Knicks on Wednesday night, the call was a courtesy on Collins’s part. He was calling to tell his former coach that he was going to announce to the world that he was gay . “I thought we were past all this, but I said, ‘Great,’ ” Rivers said. Then he told Collins: “I wish you could have gotten me more rebounds. Because at the end of the day, that’s all I really care about.” One day after Collins publicly revealed something he had long kept secret, the Celtics gathered for what may be their final practice of the 2012-13 season. They trail the Knicks, three games to one, in their best-of-seven playoff series. The obvious, and inevitable, clichés held sway when the talk revolved around what might happen in Game 5. Jeff Green noted how “the playoffs are all about adjustments.” Jason Terry said he was approaching Game 5 “as if it was a Game 7.” To a man, the Celtics spouted the familiar party line: cut down on turnovers, try to beat the Knicks in transition and see if they might be able to crack the 90-point barrier. A more thoughtful, reflective tone prevailed, however, when the topic turned to the well-liked Collins. Paul Pierce lauded Collins for his decision to come out, and possibly open the door for more athletes to do the same. Kevin Garnett said he was happy that Collins could “be himself.” Green said Collins “showed me what it takes to be a pro.” Image Jason Collins signed with the Celtics as a free agent before the start of the season. Credit Bruce Bennett/Getty Images Terry said that he not only liked having Collins as a teammate but that he wished he still had Collins as a teammate. “We definitely needed his toughness,” Terry said. “We’d love to have it in this series. He’s one of the toughest guys in the N.B.A..” Pierce said he and Rivers had talked recently about the likelihood of a gay player’s coming out, but the Boston captain said he was nonetheless floored when Collins called him Monday morning to deliver the news. “I was definitely surprised,” Pierce said. “I had no idea. We don’t know what people do with their off-time.” Pierce added: “There are so many professional athletes, there are so many human beings that live a dark life and are scared to expose it because of what people may think. But I think what he did is a great thing — to open the door for a number of athletes who are going to have the courage to come out.” Collins signed with the Celtics as a free agent before the start of the season. He started 7 of the 32 games in which he appeared, averaging 10.3 minutes. Still, he made a big impression on his coach and his teammates for the way he handled himself, for the time and work he put in, and for being a positive force in the locker room. At the trade deadline, the Celtics traded him to Washington with the injured Leandro Barbosa for Jordan Crawford. Boston had wanted to keep Collins and instead trade Chris Wilcox, but it could not swing that deal. So Collins departed. He played only 54 minutes for Washington. “When we traded him, it was hard for me to let him go,” Rivers said, “because he was so good in the locker room and said all the right things. And when you say the right things and you’re not playing, that’s unusual.” Video The Times’s John Branch on reactions to Jason Collins and how the N.B.A. veteran has broken barriers in the sports world by publicly stating he is gay. Credit Credit Bruce Bennett/Getty Images Every Celtics player who talked to reporters Tuesday said he would welcome back Collins next season. “He set good screens and got me open,” Green said, joking. “That’s all you can ask for.” Rivers said that from his experience, players wanted to play and they wanted to win. “That’s all they really care about it and honestly, that’s all they should care about,” he said. He added that when Collins called him, he had a strong inkling of what his former player was going to say. “I said, ‘Jason, I could care less what you’re going to tell me,’ ” Rivers said. ‘’That’s how I feel. I could care less. It’s not a factor to me. I know it is a factor to a lot of people. I’ve just never understood why.” REBOUNDS In Greenburgh, N.Y., Jason Collins was also on everyone’s minds as the Knicks made t preparations on Tuesday for Wednesday’s Game 5. Significantly, two Knicks — Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin — played with Collins on Nets teams that, a decade ago, twice went to the N.B.A. finals. Both were asked about Collins’s decision to disclose that he is gay. Like many other N.B.A. players, both were supportive. “Takes a brave man,” Martin said of Collins’s actions. “I commend him for having the courage to do it.” “And he was the first to do it, so you have to take off your hat to him,” he added. Kidd said: “He’s a true professional on and off the court, and it takes a lot of courage to do what he did. But it’s just going to make the world a better place at the end of the day.” Asked if he was surprised by Collins’s announcement, Kidd said: “I was caught off guard. He called me in the morning yesterday and wanted to talk to me about it and I fully support his decision. I think everything now will work itself out.” Asked if he thought that Collins, who is 34 and will become a free agent on July 1, would be signed by an N.B.A. team for the 2013-14 season, Kidd said: “I wouldn’t see why not. He’s a guy that can help and he’s a veteran guy. In this league, you need veteran guys.”",

    "source": "Time Warner Cable Finds That Money Covers Charter’s Flaws <eos> Time Warner Cable has concluded that one out of four ain’t bad. Last year, the cable operator rejected a takeover bid from a smaller rival, Charter Communications, balking at the price and the amount of leverage, cash and stock on offer. Most of the terms haven’t changed much in the deal it just agreed to, but the valuation has gone up appreciably, to more than $56 billion. It’s a stark reminder about what really matters in mergers. In January 2014, Time Warner Cable’s chairman, Robert D. Marcus, and his board rejected a “third grossly inadequate proposal” of $132.50 a share from Charter, backed by the cable mogul John C. Malone. Time Warner Cable didn’t like the amount of debt the combined company would carry. Mr. Marcus also wanted more cash and protection — so-called collars — for his shareholders against any swings in the Charter stock being proffered, because it was trading so richly. If nothing else, the tough stand bought Time Warner Cable the time that Comcast needed to swoop in with a higher bid. The offer was all in stock, at about $159 a share, and included none of the safeguards Mr. Marcus had wanted from Charter. It even lacked a provision for Comcast to pay a fee if the deal fell apart. That proved foolish, as regulators eventually killed the transaction. With the European telecommunications company Altice unexpectedly circling Time Warner Cable, Charter’s chief executive, Thomas M. Rutledge, and Mr. Malone delivered a knockout bid of almost $196 a share. It values its quarry richly at over nine times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, before the effect of any cost savings — worth about $6 billion today — compared with the seven times it offered last time. The deal includes the $100 a share in cash that Mr. Marcus originally requested, but this time it’s a lower proportion of the overall price. And the combined company, including Bright House Networks, which Charter is also buying for $10.4 billion, will carry hefty debt equivalent to about 4.5 times Ebitda. The huge premium Time Warner Cable has secured is impressive. Its shares were trading at about $95 each two years ago, before initial reports of Charter’s interest. It certainly helps distract from the complex ownership structure, high leverage, regulatory risks and rapid shifts occurring in customer habits. In financial transactions, money, not love, covers a multitude of sins.",

The gunman, identified by the authorities as Mark Becker, 24, who once played for Thomas at the school, was arrested. Thomas was airlifted to Covenant Medical Center in Waterloo, where he died, said a hospital spokeswoman, Andrea Barker. He was 58. Parkersburg, which is about 80 miles north of Des Moines, was devastated by a tornado on May 25, 2008. It killed eight people and leveled scores of homes, including Thomas’s. But Thomas set out to rebuild the football field in time for the season, and when the team went 10-0 and reached the semifinals of the state playoffs, it provided a lift in morale for a town laid low. “He embodied the essence of what a coach should be, and that legacy will endure,” Richard Wilkow, executive director of the Iowa High School Athletic Association, said in a statement. “He will be forever remembered not so much for his many wins on the field, but for the exemplary manner in which he coached kids and led the Aplington-Parkersburg community and school.” Becker was being held at Butler County Jail, charged with first-degree murder. On Sunday, he was charged by the police after a late-night, high-speed chase through two counties. Cedar Falls Police Chief Jeff Olson told the Associated Press Wednesday that the Butler County deputies who arrested Becker after the car chase agreed to take him to a hospital psychiatric ward and request that the Cedar Falls police be notified when he could be released. Olson said the Cedar Falls police did not hear anything more. Becker spent Tuesday night at his parents’ house, according to Jeff Jacobson, a special agent with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. Kevin Winker, assistant director of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, said Becker did not threaten anyone else in the weight room and was arrested without incident at home a short time after the shooting. The Des Moines Register reported that about 50 students were in the school, which was not in session, at the time of the shooting, around 8 a.m. Several football players were working out in the weight room at the time and witnessed it. Becker played football at the school, where the stadium is named after Thomas , whose 37-year coaching record was 292-84. Thomas was named by the N.F.L. as high school coach of the year in 2005, and four of his former players play in the N.F.L.: Green Bay’s Aaron Kampman, Jacksonville’s Brad Meester, Detroit’s Jared DeVries and Denver’s Casey Wiegmann.

    "source": "Radioactive Material Leaks Into Mohawk River <eos> WASHINGTON — Several hundred gallons of water contaminated with radioactive materials from a 1950s nuclear research site spilled into the Mohawk River near Schenectady on Oct. 25, prompting an investigation by the United States Energy Department. The site, part of the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory , in Niskayuna, was used to develop the technology for purifying plutonium for nuclear bombs. A rainstorm washed 600 to 800 gallons of water containing plutonium, uranium and trace amounts of two other radioactive substances, strontium and cesium, into the river, according to a letter sent by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to the Energy Department and to a contractor working to clean up the site. Officials said the amount of radioactive material released into the river was no more than the amount that would naturally flow by the site every two minutes. In a separate episode in September, workers tracked radioactive materials into clean areas on their shoes, according to the Energy Department. Neither event gave a significant radiation dose to anyone, according to federal and state officials, but the cleanup prompted by the two errors is likely to cost more than $1 million. The Energy Department is trying to quickly decommission the site, using money from the stimulus bill. The Energy Department’s principal deputy assistant, Dae Chung, said that the contractor, URS Corporation of San Francisco, might be fired. In addition, New York State could fine the company for unauthorized discharges into the river. “Obviously no system is perfect,” Mr. Chung said. “Every now and then, infrequently, we get into a contamination event.” He said the investigation would look for “root causes” to try to prevent a repetition. A spokesman for the contractor did not respond to a telephone message on Tuesday afternoon. The water that spilled was supposed to have been collected and pumped to a purification unit, but the pump failed, according to the state agency. The spill was reported Saturday by The Daily Gazette of Schenectady.",

    "source": "Falling Gas Prices Deny Russia a Lever of Power <eos> MOSCOW — As energy markets shrink, the same tactics that the Kremlin used to build Gazprom , the giant energy company, into a fearsome economic and political power that could restore Russian influence in the world are now backfiring, slashing both its profits and its influence. Throughout his eight years as president of Russia , Vladimir V. Putin pursued the strategic goal of dominating natural gas supplies to Europe and the pipelines that deliver them. His success was underscored in January, when for the second time in three years a pricing dispute with Ukraine disrupted the flow of natural gas, leaving hundreds of thousands in Eastern Europe shivering in the deep winter cold. But in his zeal to monopolize gas supplies, Mr. Putin, who is now Russia’s prime minister, committed Gazprom to long-term contracts with Central Asian countries for gas at a cost far in excess of current world prices. Now that the world economic crisis has sharply curtailed demand for gas, Gazprom is saddled with a glut of expensive Central Asian supplies that it is forced to sell at a loss. In a painful twist, the company also finds itself forced to close its own wells in Russia, which produce gas for a fraction of the cost of that from Central Asia, in order to balance its supplies with declining world demand. In effect, a strategy that made business and political sense in a time of high and seemingly ever rising prices is threatening to create years of losses and declining influence, if energy prices fail to rebound. “It’s an extraordinary turnaround from what everybody was expecting,” said Jonathan P. Stern, the director of natural gas research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. Demand for Gazprom’s natural gas will plunge by about 60 billion cubic meters this year, according to Mr. Stern — about equal to the amount the company is contractually committed to import from the former Soviet states. The turnaround for Gazprom has been as swift as it has been devastating to the company’s business model. As recently as last September, Mr. Putin, as prime minister, flew to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to wrap up a deal that consolidated Russia’s strategic gains after the war in Georgia. Under the deal, which Russia’s RIA state news agency has described as valid until 2028, Gazprom will pay, on average, $340 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2009. The price is arrived at through a complex formula based on world oil prices with a six-month delay. But that same volume of gas sells in Ukraine for an average of about $230, while European prices have sagged to an expected average of $280 for all of 2009. Gazprom, in a written statement, acknowledged that it had lost money on the Central Asian contracts this year but said they would be valuable when demand recovered. “Gazprom’s contracts with its Central Asian partners are concluded for many years into the future,” the statement said. “The world economic crisis, without doubt, is negatively influencing demand for energy. In the long term, however, demand for gas in Russia and abroad will grow. “ The declining fortunes are creating unaccustomed stresses for Gazprom, which strutted onto the world scene during the energy boom and came to symbolize the new might and swagger of Russia under Mr. Putin’s leadership. Investors, in fact, once viewed Gazprom’s close ties to the Kremlin as good for business. For example, when Gazprom raised gas prices in Ukraine after the street protests known as the Orange Revolution, the move supported the Russian foreign policy goal of pressing a pro-Western government on its southern rim. It also made money for Gazprom. Now, the political goals of Gazprom’s business in the former Soviet Union will cost the company. That trend is already visible. Last week, the European Union signed an agreement with Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey and Egypt that could revive the long delayed Nabucco pipeline, which is intended to break Russia’s monopoly on Caspian Basin energy supplies. That was quite a turnabout for Azerbaijan, which after the war in Georgia last summer had offered to sell Gazprom its entire future output of gas from an offshore development. Another former Soviet supplier, meanwhile, has accused Russia of sabotaging a pipeline to shut down deliveries of expensive gas. On the night of April 9, a portion of the pipeline carrying Central Asian gas to Russia exploded in Turkmenistan , temporarily cutting off shipments. Turkmenistan’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement blaming Gazprom for closing the valve leading to Russia, preventing gas from flowing north and creating overpressure in the pipe. News reports are sketchy, but as of May 1 the pipeline was still out of commission. Gazprom has declined to comment, but a Russian energy expert, speaking on Russian state television, said the aging Turkmen pipelines were to blame. Turkmenistan responded with an immediate overture to the West on energy issues, signing an exploration deal with the German company RWE for a bloc in Turkmenistan’s sector of the Caspian Sea shelf. RWE is a participant in the Nabucco pipeline consortium. With the affairs of Gazprom and the Kremlin so intertwined, financial troubles at the company have immediate consequences for state finances. Gazprom earned profits last year of $30.8 billion on revenues of $160.5 billion, according to annual results released this month. This year, Troika Dialog, a Moscow investment bank, has estimated that Gazprom’s profits will drop to $16.7 billion on revenues of $104 billion. As the country’s largest taxpayer, Gazprom contributed $40 billion to the state’s coffers last year, including export tariffs, profit and mineral extraction taxes. This year, financial analysts who follow the company estimate, those payments will fall by nearly half, to around $22.5 billion. Gazprom’s profits are expected to remain under pressure as long as energy prices stay at or near their current level and energy demand remains subdued. Even if the purchase price of Central Asian gas trends downward, following the decline in world oil prices, Gazprom will still have to accept delivery of that gas while keeping its own reserves — which can cost as little to produce as $4 per 1,000 cubic meters — in the ground. The current problems also carry the potential to hamper the company’s future performance. Gazprom has budgeted capital expenditures this year of $27.46 billion, according to the company, and is still planning to spend $44.8 billion in 2010, even as its revenues shrink. If it maintains these spending plans, however, it will have a negative cash flow by 2010, said Alex Fak, an oil and gas analyst at Troika, and will be compelled to borrow. “Either the oil price will have to surge, or it’s not going to happen,” Mr. Fak said of the development program.",

According to a stock exchange filing on Tuesday, the government has reduced its stake in the Lloyds Banking Group to just below 20 percent through additional share sales, as part of a trading plan that will run through the end of June. The British government took significant stakes in Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland as part of a bailout during the financial crisis, but it is eager to end its holdings in both lenders. It had a 24.9 percent stake in Lloyds when the new trading program was announced in December, and it now holds 19.9 percent. “Today’s announcement shows the further progress made in returning Lloyds Banking Group to full private ownership and enabling the taxpayer to get their money back,” a Lloyds spokesman said. “This reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank that is committed to helping Britain prosper.” The government held as much as 40 percent of Lloyds after the lender received a bailout in 2008 of 17 billion pounds, or about $26 billion at current exchange rates, but it has pared its holdings since September 2013 as the bank’s prospects have improved. Lloyds returned to an annual profit last year and will pay its first dividend this month since the government bailout. George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, vowed in the prelude to last week’s general election in Britain to sell a portion of the government’s Lloyds stake to retail investors, possibly this year. The government delayed plans in the fall to sell to retail investors amid turmoil in the markets. Newspapers over the weekend reported that the Treasury was also weighing the early disposal of its holdings in the Royal Bank of Scotland at a loss to taxpayers. Mr. Osborne told The Financial Times this year that he would like to return the bank to private ownership “as quickly as we can.” A Treasury spokesman declined on Tuesday to elaborate on the recent news reports, saying that there was no update beyond Mr. Osborne’s previous comments. The government owns a roughly 80 percent stake in R.B.S., but the lender has struggled to reshape itself into a Britain-focused retail and corporate bank. In February, R.B.S., which once had ambitions of being a global investment bank, announced plans to dismantle its investment bank and to reduce the number of countries in which it operates to about 13 from 38.",

    "source": "In Disguises, Spies Testify of Watching Terror Suspect <eos> Federal prosecutors presented the testimony of British intelligence officers as some of the most important evidence in the trial of Abid Naseer in Brooklyn, saying it was “essential” to proving the terrorism charges and insisting that the officers be allowed to wear disguises and that their faces be blurred by courtroom artists. Yet on Tuesday, despite tantalizing the jury with cryptic code words for the investigation (“Operation Pathway”) and Mr. Naseer (“Small Panel”), the five officers from the spy agency MI5 testified to more mundane observations: watching Mr. Naseer ride buses around Manchester, England; go to a mosque; and visit an Internet cafe. At one point, one of the officers told the jury, Mr. Naseer shopped for fruits and vegetables, after which, the officer said, “he appeared tense.” Mr. Naseer, who is representing himself , passed up some opportunities to water down the officers’ accounts, or at least point out that visiting mosques and taking buses are presumably not unusual in his Manchester neighborhood. The case in Federal District Court accuses Mr. Naseer of material support for terrorism and of conspiracy to use a destructive device. It stems from a 2009 plot to bomb a Manchester shopping center uncovered by British authorities. Other linked attacks were planned for Copenhagen and the New York City subway system, the authorities said, though none of the three plots were carried out. Each of the MI5 officers who spoke Tuesday had a role in tracking Mr. Naseer over a few weeks in March and April 2009, they said. The case ended up in the United States after the British investigation was compromised . In April 2009, a top British counterterrorism official was photographed carrying papers marked “SECRET” that laid out plans to arrest Mr. Naseer and several associates. The photo was quickly shared on the Internet, and officials had to rush to arrest Mr. Naseer and his associates. British authorities later released the defendants because of a lack of evidence. In 2010, Mr. Naseer was indicted in New York under a law that allows federal prosecutors to pursue terrorism cases outside the United States. He was extradited to the United States in 2013. Image Abid Naseer The intelligence officers’ disguises in court on Tuesday were sober — some appeared to wear wigs — and all wore wire-rimmed glasses. Prosecutors, citing security concerns, had obtained clearance from Judge Raymond J. Dearie for the officers to testify without providing their names, and while wearing “light disguises.” The MI5 officers testified that in that 2009 period, they watched Mr. Naseer as he took buses around Manchester, shopped, went to an Internet cafe and visited a mosque. They logged observations like “S.P. handed an unknown male a mobile phone,” “S.P.” referring to “Small Panel,” the code name for Mr. Naseer. One officer spent time in the Internet cafe, pretending he was looking at online job listings and observing Mr. Naseer and other targets of the investigation, including one who appeared to work there and was code-named “Glass Pendant.” The officer wrote notes like “S.P. has stopped using Terminal 9” and “S.P. appears to be using the computer behind the counter.” He testified that at one point, Glass Pendant and another target of the investigation passed a cellphone back and forth; later, Glass Pendant retrieved a flash drive from his pocket and put it in a computer. The significance of these acts was unclear. “Did you notice anything unusual about these individuals behind the counter?” Mr. Naseer asked the officer during cross-examination. “No, I did not,” the officer replied. Prosecutors showed some surveillance video, though at least on its own, the footage did not appear damning. It showed Mr. Naseer and his friends walking on Manchester streets, talking on cellphones and chatting in the Internet cafe. “Did the defendant’s movements cause you any alarm or cause for suspicion?” Mr. Naseer asked the first MI5 officer to testify. No, the officer replied.",

    "source": "Stanford Beats UMass in N.I.T. Semifinal <eos> In his fifth season at Stanford, Josh Owens is a bridge to better times, when the Cardinal were still an N.C.A.A. tournament regular and a powerhouse in a strong Pacific-10 Conference. Owens’s career has stumbled through darker days — including a medical condition that cost him the 2009-10 season — but he is finishing it with a flourish. In the National Invitation Tournament semifinals on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden, Owens’s 15 points and 12 rebounds paced third-seeded Stanford’s 74-64 win over Massachusetts. In the championship game on Thursday, Stanford will face Minnesota, which outlasted top-seeded Washington, 68-67, in overtime. “Our guys just pounded away,” Stanford Coach Johnny Dawkins said. “Making plays when they had to.” As it has done all season, UMass relied on its 5-foot-8 point guard Chaz Williams for a physical and emotional spark. A native of East New York in Brooklyn, Williams, a sophomore, had been UMass’s fresh burst of coiled energy since he arrived from Hofstra as a transfer. After sitting out a year, he led the team in scoring, assists, steals and minutes. But Stanford focused on Williams’s strength, not letting him penetrate with his flash-quick dribble. He scored 19 points but was 7 of 18 shooting. “We tried to keep him out of the paint as much as we possibly could,” Dawkins said. Stanford (25-11) built a 26-14 lead in the first half as fifth-seeded UMass (25-12) began out of sync offensively. But UMass closed the half strong, trimming the deficit to 3. The Minutemen took a 50-49 lead with 8 minutes 2 seconds left on a 3-pointer by Freddie Riley. Stanford used its depth and maintained its composure. Anthony Brown scored 13 of his 18 points in the second half, including a devastating 3-pointer with 2:51 remaining to give the Cardinal an 8-point lead. Stanford, which has not been to the N.C.A.A. tournament since 2008, began the season 12-2, but faded. “To be playing in the finals game, that’s an accomplishment,” Dawkins said. In the second game, the sixth-seeded Golden Gophers (23-14) built a 15-point lead, but the Huskies (24-11) clawed back. A steal and a jumper by C. J. Wilcox with 19 seconds left sent the game into overtime tied at 61-61. But Minnesota’s defense prevailed, and Andre Hollins hit a key layup for his 20th point with 31 seconds left. Now Minnesota will face the Cardinal, which has been led all season by the 6-8 Owens, who as a freshman played with Brook and Robin Lopez as well as with Landry Fields, all now in the N.B.A. But two years ago, Owens had to give up basketball for undisclosed medical reasons. There were questions about whether he would feel fit to return. Owens declined to specify what ailed him, but he indicated it was serious. “I followed the steps of the doctors that were watching me and I made it back on the court, thankfully,” he said. And his Stanford career, once thought to be over early, will continue for one more game.",

    "source": "Debt Crisis Provisions Hurt Bundesbank Profit <eos> FRANKFURT — The Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, said Tuesday that its profit plunged last year as it set aside money to cover risks from the sovereign debt crisis , a result that is certain to inflame a debate about the role the country plays in financing weaker countries in the euro zone. Profit in 2011 fell 71 percent, to 642 million euros, or $841.8 million, from 2.2 billion euros in 2010, the Bundesbank said. The bank said it had set aside an additional 4.2 billion euros to cover risk, bringing total provisions to 7.7 billion euros. The big falloff came as Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank, warned about the possible downside of easy credit that the European Central Bank has supplied to euro zone banks to help them survive the debt crisis . Mr. Weidmann said Tuesday that the European Central Bank’s money had eased tensions but might also have side effects. For example, he said, weak banks may face less pressure to confront their problems. “Everyone knows that the extra measures come with risks and side effects,” he said, adding that the E.C.B. should now be thinking about how to wean banks from the 1 trillion euros they have borrowed. Some of the risk comes from euro zone bonds purchased by the Bundesbank on behalf of the European Central Bank, Mr. Weidmann said. The Bundesbank has long been critical of the purchases of bonds from countries like Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Since taking office in May, Mr. Weidmann has continued the Bundesbank tradition of serving as the voice of prudence in the euro zone. But he denied reports that he had become isolated on the European Central Bank’s governing council, the body that sets official interest rates for the euro zone and includes heads of the national central banks. Mr. Weidmann also said there was no rift between him and Mario Draghi, the president of the E.C.B. “We respect each other and each other’s arguments,” he said. Many German commentators and citizens have become concerned about 547 billion euros that central banks of other euro zone countries owe the Bundesbank. Such a debate, involving the technicalities of the euro area’s internal system for large transfers of money, might be possible only in Germany, where the Bundesbank is regarded as a fortress of monetary stability. The Bundesbank is the largest bank in the Eurosystem, the network of central banks in the euro zone. As such it is one of the linchpins in a system known as Target 2 that commercial banks, stock exchanges and other large institutions use to make big transfers. Before the crisis began, countries like Greece and Spain that had large trade deficits would finance their shortfalls through commercial banks and capital markets. But as market financing dried up and was replaced by central bank credit, those shortfalls have been transferred to the books of central banks, especially the Bundesbank. Some economists have argued that stronger European countries are effectively financing the trade deficits of weaker countries while exposing themselves to huge risk. But others call the liabilities a predictable side effect of the increased role central banks have played as lenders of last resort, and argue they are not terribly worrisome. Mr. Weidmann said the risk of losses because of the payment system was largely theoretical. If one country like Greece left the euro zone, its central bank might have trouble meeting its obligations. In that case the other euro zone countries would share the losses, with Germany bearing the largest share as the biggest member of the zone. Mr. Weidmann emphasized that he did not expect any country to leave the euro zone. “That is not my scenario,” he said. The Bundesbank makes a profit from the interest and fees it charges commercial banks that borrow money from it or use its payment system or other services. The Bundesbank is also entitled to a share of the central bank’s profits. The Bundesbank’s profit is passed on to the German federal government. Risk provisions are deducted from profit, but if no losses materialize, the money will be added back in future years. The Finance Ministry said in a statement that the Bundesbank’s profit was less than the government had expected, but added that the money was “only a small piece of the budget.” News of the slump in profit is certain to heighten resentment among Germans who believe they are paying for mistakes made by others. At the same time, Mr. Weidmann gave a positive outlook for the German economy, noting that unemployment continued to fall. The ZEW survey of German economic sentiment, based on a poll of professional economists and analysts, rose to its highest level since June 2010. The data, published Tuesday, suggested that Germany was already recovering from a slowdown at the end of 2011. “The German economy is in remarkably good shape,” Mr. Weidmann said.",

Unlike the Hubble telescope, which was designed to be serviced by astronauts, Kepler was meant to live far from Earth, well beyond a wrench’s reach. And its Pauline-like peril and uncertain future lent some drama to this week’s scientific doings. Image A road crew in northern Belize needing crushed rock for gravel hacked at a Maya temple, dating from 250 B.C., leaving it a stump. Credit Jules Vasquez/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Developments Archaeology A Maya Pyramid, Now Gravel A construction crew in Belize needed crushed rock for a road-building project, so it turned to a convenient mound nearby and went at it with excavators. Soon the Nohmul pyramid, a historically significant Maya temple near the Mexican border, was reduced to a stump. “Only a small chunk of the pyramid, which stood about 65 feet tall and was the center of a settlement of about 40,000 people in 250 B.C., remains after backhoes and bulldozers began removing the limestone slabs with which it was built,” as CNN put it . The government of Belize wants to find and prosecute those responsible, as do local archaeologists. “The Maya had to mine for this material using nothing more than stone tools,” Dr. Jaime J. Awe of the Belize Institute of Archaeology told a Belize news station , adding that it was “mind-boggling” that this treasured antiquity, which took centuries to build, had been wrecked in a day by machinery that could have quarried elsewhere. Public Health Remember Measles? More than 1,200 cases of measles have cropped up in Britain this year, on top of 2,000 reported last year, and public health officials say that parents who refused to vaccinate their children are to blame. “More than a decade ago, British parents refused to give measles shots to at least a million children because of now discredited research that linked the vaccine to autism,” The Associated Press reported . “Now, health officials are scrambling to catch up and stop a growing epidemic.” Although developing countries still struggle with measles, the disease has all but disappeared in richer nations, except where there have been vaccine resisters. The current outbreak, centered in Wales, puts Britain behind countries like Rwanda and Cambodia in combating measles. While the research linking autism to the vaccine against measles has been found to be fraudulent and the doctor who did it has lost his medical license, some parents still refuse to inoculate their children. Image An artist’s rendition of the Kepler telescope, which lost the second of four wheels that control its orientation in space. Credit NASA/JPL, via Associated Press Environment So Totally Our Fault In a glove tossed down to climate change deniers, a paper in the journal Environmental Research Letters looked at about 4,000 scientific articles about global warming and found that 97.1 percent of them concluded that rising temperatures were “anthropogenic,” or caused by humans. “Our findings prove that there is a strong scientific agreement about the cause of climate change, despite public perceptions to the contrary,” said John Cook, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Queensland, according to an article in The Guardian . Dr. Cook is a physicist, not a climate scientist, but he collects peer-reviewed papers on climate change the way some people do “Star Trek” memorabilia; he also maintains SkepticalScience.com , which includes a list of the “most used climate myths and what the science really says.” Myth No. 1: “Climate’s Changed Before.” No. 2: “It’s the Sun.” No. 3: “It’s Not Bad.” Space Exploration A Telescope on Life Support The Kepler spacecraft has been an astronomical marvel, sending down a steady drumbeat of information that scientists use to map exotic planets far outside our solar system. But now it is in trouble , and the prospects for repair are dubious. Kepler, which is only about 9 feet by 15 feet, has four reaction wheels that are meant to keep it pointed in the right direction; at least three of them need to be working properly, and right now only two are. NASA will try to wiggle them back to life, but astronomers are deeply worried that their window to the world of exoplanets may have snapped shut. Kepler has already found more than 100 planets , providing “a mother lode of planetary systems that we will be exploring for decades in the future,” as Dimitar Sasselov, a Harvard professor who is one of Kepler’s investigators, told The Harvard Gazette . “Kepler has already delivered beyond expectations,” he added. “So it was worth every penny.” Image A model of the truck that will carry a delicate 600-ton electromagnet from Brookhaven National Laboratory to Fermilab. Credit Fermilab Bennu or Bust Speaking of space: NASA’s plan to snatch a chunk of an asteroid and bring it back to Earth moved a bit closer to fruition last week. Under the current timeline, a play date with the asteroid in question — named Bennu — will take place in 2018, two years after a spacecraft is launched for this purpose. By 2023, that spacecraft will return with a piece of Bennu, no less than 2.1 ounces, after a round trip of more than 800 million miles. The project, known by the ungainly acronym Osiris-REx, might tell us a lot; as NASA put it bluntly: “Bennu could hold clues to the origin of the solar system.” So what’s with the asteroid’s name? The Bennu was a mythical heronlike bird in ancient Egypt; a third grader from North Carolina, thinking the mission’s equipment looked somewhat birdlike, submitted the name to an asteroid-naming competition and won. Coming Up Physics An Arduous Business Trip Not everyone has a 50-foot-wide electromagnet to spare. Fortunately for the scientists at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory , who need just such an item, their colleagues at Brookhaven National Laboratory do have one sitting around. Both labs are run by the Department of Energy, and a transfer was arranged, which will be easier said than done: The 600-ton device, used to store subatomic particles called muons, will take a circuitous two-month, 3,200-mile journey from Brookhaven, N.Y., to Batavia, Ill. “The massive electromagnet must be transported in one piece,” according to a news release from Brookhaven. “It also cannot tilt or twist more than a few degrees, or the complex wiring inside will be irreparably damaged.” Popular Science said the electromagnet “will float from New York Harbor in June, down the East Coast, around Florida, up the Gulf Coast and up the Mississippi River by July.” After it arrives, the storage ring will function as a holding tank for muons generated by Fermilab’s particle accelerators, under an experiment called Muon g-2 that will look at odd properties of matter in the subatomic world.",

    "source": "Rugby's Best Wear Nothing but Black <eos> WELLINGTON — By completing its fourth grand slam of the British and Ireland Home Unions with a 37-25 victory against Wales over the weekend, New Zealand cemented its position as the favorite for the Rugby World Cup next year. While the November internationals have seen Graham Henry’s team sweep all before them in England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales for the third time in five years, those four teams as well as France, Australia and South Africa are still jockeying for position as 2011 looms. Australia and South Africa have had mixed success in Europe this month, but both ended their tours on positive notes with contrasting victories over France and England. Those victories left the two Southern Hemisphere teams as the front-runners to challenge New Zealand next year. The Wallabies dished out a 59-16 beating to the Six Nations champions, running the faltering French ragged in the seven-tries-to-one thrashing. By contrast, it was South Africa’s sheer physicality and its ability to do the basics well that undid England, 21-11. But what the matches of the past few weeks have highlighted is the fact that, at the moment, it is the team in black that is consistently producing the goods. That is not to say New Zealand cannot improve. It has been heavily penalized in the scrums throughout the tour to the chagrin of assistant coach Steve Hansen, and its poor discipline should have been more costly than it was against Wales. But, under the astute guidance of captain Richie McCaw, who along with Mils Muliaina overtook Sean Fitzpatrick for most appearances with the All Blacks, and navigator Daniel Carter (now the leading point scorer in international rugby after surpassing the 1,187 by Jonny Wilkinson of England), the All Blacks are showing more maturity and play the game at an intensity and speed that few teams can match for the full 80 minutes. Their defense is brutal, and it is rare that they do not take any half-opportunity presented to them. No longer can the opposition simply hoof the ball down field to relieve the pressure and wait for the mistakes to come, because more often than not they do not, and the All Blacks counterattack can be deadly. Wales learned that the hard way at Millennium Stadium, with three of New Zealand’s five tries the result of poor clearing kicks. Muliaina benefited in the first half. Then with the game in the balance, Wales fullback Lee Byrne failed to find touch from a penalty, and a few moments later Hosea Gear was going over in the corner for his second try, all while New Zealand was a man down with flanker Daniel Braid in the sin bin. Isaia Toeava benefited again late in the game before John Afoa’s try crushed any lingering Welsh hopes. “I think today’s game was ideal for us,” Hansen told Reuters after beating Wales. “At times we were in similar situations that we were in another game at Cardiff against another particular team,” he said, referring to the shocking World Cup quarterfinal loss to France in 2007. “Today we actually showed our maturity and ended up winning, I think reasonably comfortably, whereas in that game we didn’t and we all went home with long faces. Today we are smiling and feeling pretty happy.” That is not to say that Wales, which has lost its last seven test matches now, did not have its moments — and it needed to after its woeful 16-16 draw against Fiji on Nov. 19. It fought doggedly up front, and in the backs Tom Shanklin was able to break the gain line a couple of times to at least keep the New Zealand defenders honest. But the ability to regularly get across the advantage line was missing, and the decision-making, accuracy and composure must improve if they are to turn defeats against the Southern Hemisphere heavyweights into victories. It has been a similar tale for England and Ireland too. They played well in patches against New Zealand, but Scotland was ruthlessly outplayed by the Tri-Nations champions and bedazzled by the outrageous off-loading ability of the giant center Sonny Bill Williams. Australia’s record victory against France has done wonders for its confidence. The youthful back line was exposed by a rejuvenated England at Twickenham earlier in the tour, and it was noticeable then that when things went wrong, the players lost their composure and their heads dropped. There was none of that against France, which had an unimpressive campaign that brought earlier victories over Fiji and Argentina. But concerns still remain with the Australian scrum, goal-kicking and defensive lapses, and all need to improve drastically if the Wallabies are to succeed at the World Cup. South Africa has not looked like a world champion team this year, and its victories against Ireland and Wales were unconvincing. A loss to a limited Scotland side, which just sneaked a 19-16 victory against Samoa over the weekend, ended South Africa’s grand slam hopes and was a new low after the positive drug tests returned by Bjorn Basson and Chiliboy Ralepelle. But the Springboks’ 21-11 triumph against England showed that winning the set-piece battle remains an important part of rugby even in this new age of attacking enterprise. England stuck to its new attacking mantra but was simply outmuscled and turned the ball over too easily. With the line-out and scrum struggling and no platform to build off, the players simply ran into a big green wall. England’s move away from the kick-centric set-piece to set-piece brand of rugby to counterattacking with ball in hand has been refreshing. And at least now England has players in Ben Youngs, Toby Flood, Ben Foden, Chris Ashton and Mark Cueto able to assess situations in front of them rather than stick doggedly to the game book. The key in the coming months will be to do it consistently and more effectively. Ireland worked hard to beat Samoa and eased past Argentina, and it showed flashes of quality on attack against South Africa and New Zealand. Its swarming defense can be hard to break down too, as those two teams found, but the effort has to be maintained for the whole match, not just 60 or 70 minutes, if victories over Southern Hemisphere opposition are to be anything other than a rarity.",

    "source": "Suicide Bomber Kills 15 at a Sunni Mosque in Baghdad <eos> BAGHDAD — The plaza in front of Baghdad’s famous Abu Hanifa mosque in the Adhamiya district has lately been a place of joyous celebration and worship. On Sunday evening it was a scene of terror, as a suicide bomber struck a crowded street in front of the mosque. The police and witnesses said the blast killed 15 people and wounded 29 others. Among the dead was Faruq Abdul Sattar, a deputy commander of Adhamiya’s Sunni Awakening council, the American-backed local force that guards the neighborhood, which is a Sunni stronghold. Witnesses said that the bomber, a man, may have been riding a motorcycle that was parked about 65 feet from a traffic light on the street. Mr. Sattar, a popular figure in the neighborhood who was known by the nickname Abu Omar, was standing on the median that divided the street with a group of other Awakening Council members when the bomb went off, about 7:40 p.m., witnesses said. “Abu Omar is gone! Abu Omar is gone!,” many in the crowd shouted when Mr. Omar’s torn body was identified by a silver ring he wore on his right hand and the distinctive green pattern of his uniform. “I sat down near the traffic light and I saw Abu Omar standing near the traffic light,” said Hassan Hadi, 37, a truck driver. “He talked with some of the neighborhood people, then one of my friends asked to go with him to drink a cup of tea in a shop across the street. “After a while I saw a guy driving a motorcycle,” Mr. Hadi said. “He parked the motorcycle 65 feet from Abu Omar’s location, and then he walked toward him. After that the explosion happened.” An Awakening Council official confirmed that the explosives were detonated by a male suicide bomber. The victims included other Awakening Council members and some civilians. After the bombing, a sheik who worked at the Abu Hanifa mosque became worried when the surviving Awakening Council members began firing their weapons in the air and called over the mosque’s loudspeaker for the crowd to disperse. Adhamiya, once the site of fierce fighting between insurgents and American and Iraqi forces, has been quieter in recent months. Last spring thousands of people, drawn by the reduced levels of violence, gathered at the Abu Hanifa mosque for the first time in years to celebrate the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday. Earlier on Sunday, two journalists from the Afaq television channel and their driver were wounded by a grenade thrown inside their car near Al Zawra park in Baghdad. Violence also erupted in Iraq ’s northern Kurdish autonomous region, where police in Erbil shot and killed two people, one a 14-year-old boy, after a demonstration turned into a small riot. The demonstrators, members of a Kurdish tribe from the town of Khliffan, were protesting inadequate water services in the town. Massoud Barzani, the leader of the Kurdistan Regional Government, said in a news conference that the police opened fire when the demonstrators began to attack government buildings.",

    "source": "Skipping the Legal Partner Track for a Private Shingle <eos> Five and a half years ago, after spending years as commercial litigation lawyers at Proskauer Rose in New York City, Sari Gabay-Rafiy and Anne Marie Bowler decided to strike out on their own. They started Gabay-Rafiy & Bowler more as a lifestyle choice than a money-making venture. The first year in business, Ms. Gabay-Rafiy said, she made “just enough to pay the babysitter.” Over time, Ms. Gabay-Rafiy and Ms. Bowler learned to re-evaluate their business practices continually to assess what was useful and profitable. That led to their decision in 2009 to move to smaller office space and to discontinue storing files offsite. Moving cut their rent 35 percent (they sublet two offices in the new space to nonlawyers) and storing files onsite saved them about $300 a month. They run a lean operation — just the two of them and one assistant — and they rely on their connections to an informal network of lawyers for everything from expert advice to case referrals. They sent announcements to every lawyer they knew when they left Proskauer, and they exchange business cards everywhere they go: seminars, continuing education courses, cocktail parties, networking events, even elementary school drop-offs. Today, despite the recession, the firm is thriving. The partners say they have exceeded what they were earning when they left Proskauer. And they are part of what appears to be a trend of lawyers in their mid-20s to early 40s leaving large firms to start their own small ones. Statistics are not easy to come by, but Margie R. Grossberg, a partner at the legal recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa , said she saw an increasing number of associates choosing entrepreneurship. “In the past, associates found if they worked really hard and did the right things, they made partner,” she said. “That’s not necessarily the case anymore. The odds are a lot slimmer, and it’s also not as coveted as it once was.” These lawyers want more control over their futures, Ms. Grossberg said, and they do not want to wait until they become partner to have meaningful relationships with clients. The economy is another factor. “There have been thousands of associates laid off because of the recession,” said Eric A. Seeger, a principal at Altman Weil , a legal consultancy. “We’re seeing more lawyers out there now taking risks, and that includes going out on their own.” Starting a law firm presents many challenges, especially for associates who have not had much experience running a firm. Michael Yim, Jane Chuang and a third lawyer, all former law school classmates, decided to start a firm in Manhattan last year, taking one large client with them. Three months later that client dropped them, taking 75 percent of the fledging firm’s revenue. Mr. Yim and Ms. Chuang’s third partner could not stomach the loss, and the relationship among the three became tense. He soon left, but Mr. Yim and Ms. Chuang soldiered on. “We started from scratch again, taking a long-term view of profit generation,” Mr. Yim said. The firm became Yim & Chuang and now, a year later, business is better than Mr. Yim had projected, although marketing has been difficult. “There aren’t a lot of people who know about us yet,” he said. Still, he and Ms. Chuang decided not to take work they could not handle or simply did not want, even when it was tempting. “You can get this sense of desperation where you’ll take any paying client that walks through the door,” Mr. Yim said. “We’ve learned the best clients are people we would socialize with, because the relationship is comfortable, there is trust and it’s far more productive.” In 2007 Joel Kauth and two of his colleagues left Christie Parker Hale in Irvine, Calif., to start Kauth, Pomeroy, Peck & Bailey with Kent Pomeroy, a lawyer and accountant. Mr. Kauth and his former Christie colleagues did not like the traditional billable-hours structure, so they decided to give clients a flat rate for services. “Clients love us because we give them predictability,” Mr. Kauth said. “It’s not some billable black hole.” The billing system has been profitable for the firm because its partners have enough experience to estimate their time, and they give specific prices for particular tasks. Still, once in a while, Mr. Kauth said, “if the court is being difficult or opposing counsel is crazy, the cost goes up and we just have to eat it.” The firm bills up front when the costs for third-party services like document production or expert witnesses is high. “Large firms have an infrastructure in place that can absorb big purchases for a large case,” Mr. Kauth said. “When you’ve got three or four people, it’s much tougher. I can’t front $300,000 on a project.” Clients are generally understanding, he said, and the firm gives them the vendor’s bill, so they see there is no markup. Shortly after the firm started, Mr. Pomeroy decided to pursue other career opportunities, but he provided financial guidance to the legal start-up and designed its accounting system. At first, he said, his former colleagues did not understand the costs involved in running a law firm. “These guys didn’t pay the bills at Christie,” he said. “They didn’t realize that lawyers are the last ones to get paid after rent, LexisNexis, paralegals, secretaries, utilities, workers’ compensation insurance, payroll taxes — all the things needed to run the firm.” Before Mr. Kauth and his colleagues left their jobs, Mr. Pomeroy insisted they come up with a budget for the new firm and estimate how long it might be before they would be able to pay themselves. The best case was two months. Mr. Pomeroy said lawyers going out on their own should be able to last a minimum of three months, but preferably six, without a paycheck. When Serena Minott started Minott Gore in Miami in 2007 with a fellow large-firm refugee, Keesonga Gore, she found that without a partner telling her what to do and when to do it, time management was difficult. Now, she reserves Monday through Wednesday for client work and Thursday and Friday for business development. “I also keep a daily to-do list with the top three to four things that must get finished that day,” she said. “I don’t leave until those are finished, and then I can run a couple of errands and have lunch. I’ve learned that once you leave the office, it’s hard to regain focus.” In 2010, Cynthia Gilbert, an intellectual property, or I.P., lawyer, left Choate Hall & Stewart and started Hyperion Law in Boston. She wanted to work with small companies. “If you’re a billion-dollar company, you have probably figured out your I.P. strategy,” she said. “Smaller companies don’t have the resources to hire a high-powered attorney to help with that.” At Choate, Ms. Gilbert tried to bring in small clients, but her 2,000 hours a year billing requirement left little time for business development. After leaving, Ms. Gilbert spent the next seven months networking, “going from coffee to coffee to lunch and then dinner, meeting anyone interested in having a conversation about opportunities for small businesses.” She was able to manage financially during this period by using some savings, doing contract work for other lawyers and working for two former Choate clients. Now she is learning to handle uncertainty. “Some months you do amazingly well,” she said, “and then for several months you’re slow. You have to stick it out and handle the anxiety. By the end of my first six months, I could see the ebbs and flows. I’m calmer about it now because I know it’s cyclical — it’s not that I’m failing.”",

    "source": "Instead of a Sale, Hulu Concentrates on ‘The Awesomes’ <eos> MOST of the news about Hulu recently has focused on whether the popular video streaming site would be sold. Last week, the owners of Hulu — 21st Century Fox, the Walt Disney Company and NBCUniversal — provided a reprieve : instead of selling Hulu, they said it would invest $750 million in the site and increase competition with Netflix, which has had tremendous success with its slate of original programming, including a handful of Emmy nominations Thursday. With a sale averted, Hulu executives can now focus on more important matters — promoting the site’s highly anticipated animated series “The Awesomes,” which will make its debut Aug. 1. The show stars Seth Meyers as the voice of one of the main characters, Prock. Mr. Meyers is also a co-creator, executive producer and writer along with Michael Shoemaker, whose production credits include “Saturday Night Live” and “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.” “The Awesomes” is Hulu’s first original series this year and its first animated series. The show follows a team of less-than-stellar superheroes called “The Awesomes” who come together after the original team of elite superheroes by the same name is disbanded. In addition to Mr. Meyers, the show features the voices of other “Saturday Night Live” stars including Bill Hader and Taran Killam. In an interview, Mr. Meyers and Mr. Shoemaker described the show as a “passion project” that they shopped around to different networks until they found the right fit with Hulu. “Hulu was willing to turn it over to us creatively,” Mr. Meyers said. “Hulu was the first place that really understood it.” “The Awesomes” also secured a sponsor in Jack Link’s Beef Jerky. The brand partnership includes product integrations in the show and short episode extensions that involve the characters from “The Awesomes” and Sasquatch, the beef jerky mascot. There will also be traditional 30-second and 60-second ads with Mr. Meyers and Mr. Shoemaker writing the copy for the ads. In one episode extension, two of the characters are talking about the free food perks the group no longer receives. “No more lobster Mondays? Make-your-own-taco Tuesdays?” says Muscleman, a brawny character who wears a bright red wrestling leotard. “All gone,” says Prock, adding that he has, instead, “lots of Jack Link’s jerky.” Image Michael Shoemaker, left, and Seth Meyers are the creators, executive producers and writers of the animated series “The Awesomes,” which will start broadcasting on Aug. 1. Credit Brad Barket/Getty Images for Hulu “I love that stuff,” says Muscleman. But the characters also acknowledge, in a tongue-in-cheek way, that what they are doing is a paid advertisement. According to data from Kantar Media, a unit of WPP, Jack Link’s spent $13.1 million on marketing in 2011 and $8.8 million in 2012. Hulu spent $9.3 million on advertising in 2011 and $63.6 million in 2012, according to Kantar. Mr. Meyers said brand partnerships like this one were necessary. “I’m a realist and you have to pay for these shows,” he said. “It’s how this stuff works. I think it’s been helpful for me to work in TV for 12 years. No one’s paying to watch ‘Saturday Night Live’ but I still get a check every week.” Andy Forssell, acting chief executive and senior vice president of content at Hulu, said, “You want this to be a beacon to show how this can be done well,” referring to the brand integration. “You don’t want to have to make any creative sacrifices.” Jeff LeFever, vice president of marketing for Jack Link’s, said: “We want to become part of the everyday vernacular and everyday culture that’s out there, not just a transactional product. In this media landscape it takes everybody out of the traditional way of doing things. The studio, the media partner all leaning together.” Unlike Netflix, Hulu derives revenue from both subscriptions and advertising. Mr. Forssell said subscription fees and ad revenue from Hulu Plus, its paid subscription business, made up more than half of the company’s revenue. “Both businesses are critical and will be part of our identity for years and years to come,” he said. In addition to brand integration with Jack Link’s , Hulu has a separate plan to promote and market the show, whose target audience is adults ages 20 to 39. Digital banner ads promoting the show will run on Hulu and Hulu Plus, including personalized ads that prompt viewers who like a certain show — for instance, “Family Guy” — to watch “The Awesomes.” Digital ads will also run on sites like BuzzFeed, Pandora, the Onion, Yahoo and AOL. Hulu will show an episode of the show and host a panel with some cast members at Comic Con, a convention in San Diego on Saturday. On July 25, Xbox Live users will be able to watch an ad-free preview of the show. Billboards and other wall postings will be displayed in New York and Los Angeles.",

Brazil has never won Olympic gold in the sport. Neymar scored in the first 15 seconds of the semifinal at the Maracanã stadium but collided with the Honduran goalkeeper Luis Lopez on the goal. Neymar was down on the field for several minutes, then staggered after getting up and was taken off the field on a stretcher. The crowd at Maracanã was stunned into quiet for a time before breaking into song to encourage Neymar, the country’s superstar, who returned quickly. Gabriel Jesus added to the drama with two goals, in the 26th and 35th minutes, for Brazil. Marquinhos scored in the 51st minute. Luan added a goal in the 79th minute before Neymar’s penalty kick in the first minute of stoppage time. GERMANY REACHES ANOTHER FINAL IN BRAZIL Lukas Klostermann scored in the ninth minute and Nils Petersen added a goal in the 89th to put Germany into the gold medal match with a 2-0 semifinal victory over Nigeria. The Germans will play Brazil on Saturday at the Maracanã stadium. The German senior team thrashed host Brazil, 7-1, in the 2014 World Cup semifinals. Nigeria will face Honduras in the bronze medal match. VOLLEYBALL American Men Sweep Into Semifinals The United States men’s volleyball team is on to the semifinals, beating Poland in straight sets for a fourth straight victory since a surprising 0-2 Olympic start. Bolt Is Back 13 Photos View Slide Show › Image Doug Mills/The New York Times The fifth-ranked Americans beat second-ranked Poland, 25-23, 25-22, 25-20, building some serious momentum at the Maracanãzinho arena after dropping their initial two matches to Canada and Italy. Now, both the United States men’s and women’s teams are on to the semifinals. BASKETBALL Parker Bids French National Team Adieu After a 92-67 loss to Spain, Tony Parker, a star point guard for the San Antonio Spurs, said that he is retiring from the French national team. Parker, 34, has played in France’s program for nearly half his life and said it was difficult to say goodbye. Despite all his accomplishments in the N.B.A., Parker has had limited success as an international player. France did not qualify for the 2004 Athens Games or the 2008 Beijing Games and finished sixth in London four years ago. France won its only Olympic medal — a silver — in 2000 when Parker was not on the team. BIRD HAS A KNEE SPRAIN Sue Bird, the United States women’s basketball team’s point guard and captain, has a knee capsule sprain and is day to day. A magnetic resonance imaging exam Wednesday showed the sprain, which was good news to Bird. Bird said in a statement through U.S.A. Basketball that, “Obviously I felt a huge relief.” She added that the hardest part was waiting and not knowing. Bird, 35, was injured in the second quarter and sat out the second half of Tuesday night’s 110-64 win over Japan. WATER POLO United States Women Will Play For Gold It will be the United States versus Italy for women’s water polo gold. Maggie Steffens scored four times and the United States beat Hungary, 14-10, in the semifinals. Maddie Musselman and Kiley Neushul had two goals apiece for the United States, which is trying to become the first country to repeat as Olympic champions in the sport. Italy advanced with a 12-9 victory over Australia in the first semifinal. Arianna Garibotti scored five goals and Roberta Bianconi scored twice as Italy improved to a perfect 5-0 in the tournament. Italy won the gold medal in 2004 but slipped to sixth in Beijing and finished seventh in London four years ago. The United States has won 21 in a row, including its five games in Rio by a combined score of 61-27.",

    "source": "Burress Gives London a Go <eos> LONDON, Oct. 27 — Plaxico Burress had never been to London until this week, when he came with the Giants to play in Sunday’s game against the Dolphins . He had no interest in London, he admitted, and no plans to return later when he could take time to explore. On the field, Burress is a big-play receiver, but off it he is the type of person who would just rather be at home. Count him as one player who is not a fan of the N.F.L.’s global aspirations. But Burress had come this far. So, with a short window available on Saturday afternoon, he agreed to go on a 60-minute tour of London sights. That explained why Burress stood in a spitting drizzle near Marble Arch, waiting for one of those double-decker, open-topped tour-guided buses, the kind that snakes around the city in circles, swallowing and belching tourists at postcard spots along the way. The Giants, like the Dolphins, are viewed as ambassadors for the N.F.L. as the league experiments with how and where it wants to grow. But the teams this week were bent on trying to keep things as normal as possible. What resulted was a strange balance. Quarterback Eli Manning spent part of Saturday delivering a jersey to the prime minister’s residence at 10 Downing Street. The team released photographs of Manning standing at the door in his jersey, giving the jersey to a man in the doorway, then walking away wearing a T-shirt. They looked like time-lapse photos of a trick-or-treater handing in a costume. A visitor in the lobby at the team’s hotel noted the sour expressions many of the players wore as they came and went Saturday afternoon. The trip seems destined to be one far more appreciated in hindsight. That is probably how Burress will view it. “If he has a great game and the crowd loves him, he’ll say: ‘You know what? I do like London,’” his wife, Tiffany, said laughing. But now, Burress was standing under a bus shelter on a bleak English day, wearing a dreary expression. “Buckingham Palace,” he said. It was the one sight in London he could name. Well, that and the newly opened Wembley Stadium, which the team saw earlier Saturday. Burress declared it “the greatest stadium I’ve ever been in.” He was especially impressed by the bathrooms and the locker rooms, and said it still had that new-stadium smell. He did not seem impressed with the grass surface. He said it had little grab and he expected plenty of slipping during Sunday’s game, which could be played in rain. Of the four pairs of cleats he took, he will wear the ones with the longest spikes. A man recognized Burress at the bus stop and asked to take his photograph. Burress offered a tepid nod, and the man was unsure if that was a positive signal. Burress can be difficult to interpret; an uninterested look often masks an easy manner. This time, waiting for a bus on a loop to nowhere, Burress probably was truly uninterested. But he sat for the photograph. Tiffany came along for the ride — the couple’s 9-month-old son, Elijah, stayed home with family — and had a more enthusiastic attitude. The drizzle stopped, and the couple climbed the spiral stairs of the next bus. Down Regent Street and into Piccadilly Circus they went, to the strains of traffic noise and a guide with a microphone who explained what was zipping past. A newspaper photographer snapped countless photographs of the Burresses along the way, drawing the attention of other tourists away from London’s monuments. A woman asked, “Are they famous?” Down Whitehall from Trafalgar Square, Big Ben — actually the clock tower, which contains the bell called Big Ben — came into view. “That’s what that is?” said Burress, who knew Big Ben as his onetime teammate Ben Roethlisberger, the Steelers quarterback. “The one with the clock?” The bus crossed the River Thames at Westminster Bridge, and the party climbed out at the next stop. Burress turned the corner and saw the London Eye, the giant Ferris wheel-style observation deck that twirls slowly alongside the south side of the river. There. Now that was something he had seen before. “From ‘X-Men,’” Burress said, smiling. He might have meant the latest “Fantastic Four” movie, which has a prominent scene with the Eye. A breeze chilled the air, but Burress was warming up. He walked down to the Eye for a closer look, then back across Westminster Bridge, toward the clock tower and the Houses of Parliament. He stopped to buy a cup of hot caramelized peanuts from a vendor, and chomped them as he walked. “It’s cool, man,” he said as he looked around. “This is pretty nice.” Time was almost gone. From Westminster Abbey, a black cab took the tour around St. James Park, down the Mall and past Buckingham Palace. “It’s like a house in there?” Burress asked in wonder. “And this is all backyard?” he asked as the cab passed the walled gardens. Back at the hotel, a little more than an hour after he left, Burress seemed pleased, like the Dr. Seuss character who finally ate the green eggs and ham. Burress may come back after all. “Does the sun shine over here?” he asked. “Where’s the sun at? That would help a little bit.”",

    "source": "Guardian of a Brooklyn Housing Project <eos> Lisa Kenner does not think of herself as poor, though she lives in the poorest neighborhood in New York City. She is the self-appointed guardian of the Van Dyke I Houses, a rambling complex of 22 brick buildings scattered around courtyards, parking lots and a community center in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Residents do not choose their neighbors at Van Dyke. They are placed in the 1,603 apartments by the New York City Housing Authority based on low-income guidelines. The average rent is $430. The average length of stay, 19 years. For Ms. Kenner, being poor and living poor are two different things. She makes that clear to everyone, in a way that has caused conflicts with residents and housing workers at times, and brought herself trouble as well. She entered a building at 372 Blake Avenue on a recent afternoon, striding past the newly scrubbed lobby to get the elevator. She pressed 14. That has always been her method, start at the top and work down. The doors slid open to a sunlit floor. She sniffed. Urine. She studied the worn floor tiles: grungy, but passable. Then she headed down the stairwell to 13. Three hall lights out, a safety hazard. Down another flight, grease stains and cigarette butts. Ms. Kenner flipped open her cellphone to call the superintendent. “I’m doing the walk down in 372,” she said in a deep, rumbling voice. “This building is nasty.” Van Dyke sits at the heart of a nine-block area, known to census workers as Tract 910, that makes up the poorest neighborhood of significant size in the city, a 2014 analysis by the Queens College sociology department found. The 5,620 residents have a median household income of $11,220 annually from all sources, including welfare benefits and food stamps, compared with $51,865 for the city. About two-thirds are black, and one-third are Hispanic. Ms. Kenner has never lived anywhere else. As president of the Van Dyke Resident Association for 12 years, she has turned a volunteer position into a full-time occupation. She scours reports from the New York City Housing Authority in a cinder-block basement office that she mops and cleans herself. She keeps the heavy metal door propped open for any resident with a problem. Sitting at a conference table, she dispenses chilled water from a refrigerator, along with advice and emails for housing officials. Image The Van Dyke I Houses are visible from the Junius Street subway station. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times She is seen by some as their strongest advocate, and by others as unforgiving and difficult. Ms. Kenner was criticized by residents for canceling an annual Family Day celebration three years ago because she said people were not helping to organize it and were leaving their trash. The caretakers who clean the buildings have been heard to say, “Where does she think she lives, the White House?” In July, she had a confrontation with a caretaker who claimed that Ms. Kenner hit her. Ms. Kenner said she never touched the woman. The property manager for Van Dyke sent Ms. Kenner a letter warning that her lease was being considered for termination. The reasons cited were “non-desirability” because of “physical assault against a Nycha employee” and “chronic rent delinquency.” Ms. Kenner has paid rent late 10 times in the past year, according to Housing Authority records. In her defense, Ms. Kenner said she tried to pay her rent every month but sometimes did not have enough money to cover all of it. She said that she did not know she had been carrying a rent balance, and that she had not previously received late notices. Housing officials said Ms. Kenner’s monthly rent bill indicated the outstanding balance. Image Ms. Kenner, in the purple shirt. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times “They’re trying to get me out because I stay up on stuff,” Ms. Kenner said. “It’s not that I’m looking out for me. I’m looking out for everybody.” Van Dyke, which was completed in 1955, has been drawn into efforts to help alleviate the city’s shortage of affordable housing. The Housing Authority plans to sell an underused parking lot there to a nonprofit developer for a 12-story rental building with support services for low-income and homeless families. Housing officials said the proceeds from the sale, expected to be $1.8 million, would be reinvested in Van Dyke. The plan has angered some residents, who say that the complex is crowded enough and that it has become a “dumping ground” for the poor. Ms. Kenner sees a more complex equation. She said that while she hated to lose what little Van Dyke had, she could not oppose the plan. “Who am I to stop anyone from living in a decent place?” she asked. Pockets of Poverty in New York City A 2014 analysis of census data by Queens College shows that Census Tract 910, in Brownsville, Brooklyn, is the poorest in the city. Crime is ever-present in Brownsville , though it has declined significantly in the past decade, as in the rest of the city. This year through Sept. 14, there were 13 murders, 15 rapes, 276 robberies and 446 felony assaults recorded in the 73rd Precinct, which covers Ocean Hill and Brownsville, including Van Dyke. Some residents say they constantly fear being hit by a stray bullet, or getting caught in a gang fight. Just this week, a 12-year-old boy was accidentally shot as he got off his school bus. Dorothy Glover, 56, who lives with her son and three grandchildren, said she was worried about her family’s safety. She recalled that shortly after moving there in 2001 from a homeless shelter in the Bronx, she walked out of her building to find a bullet-ridden body on the ground. “I just turned back upstairs, and I prayed and I cried for that young man,” she said. Ms. Kenner, 55, grew up at Van Dyke, the third of eight children of a truck driver and a housewife from Virginia. She was the nurturing one in the family, she said, the one who picked the middle names of her younger siblings and acted as their protector. At 17, she became a single mother. She dropped out of high school when her own mother died of cancer. Her son’s father, a boy from a neighboring project whom she met at a party, was shot five times in a nearby park. Ms. Kenner sent her son, then 6, to the funeral in Puerto Rico, but stayed home herself because she could not afford two plane tickets. Image Ms. Kenner on her rounds of Van Dyke. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times She passed her G.E.D. exam on the second try and earned a degree in public administration from Medgar Evers College. She was a counselor at the former Spofford Juvenile Center in the Bronx and then a caseworker for the city’s Human Resources Administration. Unemployed since 2010, she lives on disability benefits for back and knee injuries. She declined to give her income. A stout woman with a pair of $2 sunglasses perpetually perched on her closely shaved head, Ms. Kenner walks around with a bullhorn to get people to meetings of the Van Dyke Resident Association, which has just 60 members. One of her ideas was a quality-of-life committee to help residents keep tabs on their own buildings. It has not worked out: Only 10 buildings are represented. “If you don’t complain, you don’t get nothing,” Ms. Kenner said. “I get up in the morning and I fight so much I’m tired. They want to beat me down, but I come right back.” Image Outside a deli on the northern edge of the housing project. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times At a June residents meeting, Ms. Kenner chided those who tried to slip in late and rapped a silver bell — the kind used to summon a hotel bellman — whenever someone tried to talk over her or another resident. She glared at a community affairs police official on his cellphone. “It’s the president of the United States,” the official said. “He’d tell you, ‘Courtesy,’ ” she snapped. Ms. Kenner has no patience for those who do not show respect to Van Dyke. After dirty diapers were thrown out the window of one building, she identified all the households with babies and asked management to send warning letters to each one. She even reports people for hanging laundry out their windows. “That looks ghetto,” she said. “They say we live in a poverty-stricken area. We don’t have to act like we live in no ghetto. I don’t know where the ghetto is.” Image Ms. Kenner mingling after a tenants’ association meeting. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times Luz Perez, a member of the association, called Ms. Kenner “the glue” that held their community together. “She doesn’t leave anybody out,” Ms. Perez said. “She even gives the knucklehead a chance. A lot of people don’t even see what’s happening.” A spokeswoman for the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio said city and housing officials had renewed their efforts to reduce residents’ waiting time for maintenance work and repairs in housing projects. At Van Dyke, the average response time for routine repairs was five days in August, down from 131 days in August 2013, according to housing records. At Housing Authority buildings citywide, the average response time was seven days, compared with 108 days the year before. Joan Lebow, a spokeswoman for the authority, said it had also drastically reduced its backlog of repairs and was “making rapid strides to improve residents’ quality of life by taking down construction sheds, upgrading security and adding new lighting.” “As Nycha moves forward, doing more with less, those who live and work in public housing share the aim to strengthen each community,” Ms. Lebow said. “And together Nycha and its residents are accountable for ensuring a vibrant future for public housing in New York where everyone can have the safe, clean, affordable home they deserve.” At 372 Blake Avenue, Ms. Kenner was fuming as she scraped dirt off the floor with her sandal. It was her third visit in six months, she said. After the first two, she launched a blitz of emails on housing officials. Now it was filthy again. “This floor hasn’t been washed in a month, you can tell, all this dirt,” she told Kenrick Duprey, an assistant superintendent, who trailed after her, jotting notes on a yellow pad. “Right, I got you,” he said. Mr. Duprey said later that he found Ms. Kenner helpful. “She’s tough because she wants the place to look the way it’s supposed to,” he said. But on this day, a second-floor resident came out to tell Ms. Kenner that she used to sweep the hallway to keep the mice at bay, but gave up because it got too dirty. “You need to call Housing,” Ms. Kenner replied. “You’re not supposed to live like this. I can’t come here every day.”",

Women are not allowed to enter movie theaters or concert halls or often even to be outdoors without head scarves, the Human Rights Watch report said. Tanya Lokshina, a Russia researcher at Human Rights Watch and the report’s author, said at a news conference in Moscow that the Chechen women shot with paintballs last summer for failing to follow the dress code were too frightened to file formal complaints.

    "source": "Pakistani Tribe Signs Pact to Cooperate With Officials <eos> PESHAWAR, Pakistan — A major tribe with close ties to the Pakistani Taliban signed an agreement with the government on Monday to hand over several of the militant group’s local leaders, to lay down arms and to stop harboring foreign militants. The agreement with the Mamoond tribe, the largest and most strategically placed in the restive Bajaur region, followed a military victory against the local Taliban last month. It was one of the first major successes of the Pakistani forces against the militants and their affiliates in Al Qaeda since they started operations in the tribal areas in 2003. Taliban forces in Bajaur then declared a unilateral cease-fire and the Mamoond, whose members live on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, decided to cooperate with the government. According to the 28-point agreement, a copy of which was made available to The New York Times, the Mamoond will stop harboring foreign militants and will close down militant training camps. The agreement also calls for the surrender of senior Taliban leaders in Bajaur, including a deputy, Maulvi Faqir Muhammad, and the group’s chief spokesman, Maulvi Said Muhammad, who also goes by the name Maulvi Omar. The entire Taliban leadership in Bajaur comes from the Mamoond, which has also been accused of harboring Qaeda operatives. “It’s the peoples’ victory more than a military success,” Maj. Gen. Tariq Khan, who led the recent military strikes in Bajaur, told the Pakistani newspaper Dawn . He promised to clear militants from a remaining small pocket in Bajaur within the next couple of days. The agreement was signed by tribal elders from the Mamoond and a government representative in Khar. Tribe members in Bajaur “will not indulge in terrorism activities in Pakistan, including the tribal areas, nor will they facilitate anyone in this regard,” the agreement states. “They will not allow the use of their territory for any subversive activities nor will they allow anyone to do so.” It also states, “Similarly, no local or foreign militant will be allowed to cross the border with Afghanistan.” The agreement also says that all religious schools will be registered with the government, and that no new ones will be set up in Bajaur without the government’s approval. Heavy weapons must be surrendered to the authorities within 30 days, the agreement says.",

Huddled around radios on their fire escapes and roofs, in their kitchens and living rooms, people were listening to the heavyweight boxing match between Joe Louis and Max Schmeling. “Harlem was in stereo,” said Representative Charles B. Rangel, who grew up in Harlem and was 8 years old at the time of the fight. “Everyone had on the same station, the same fight. You heard the same screaming and yelling when he was winning, and the same sighs when he got hit.” Louis once captivated the minds and hearts of New Yorkers, especially those in Harlem’s thriving black community. But as New York’s mantle as boxing’s premier stage ebbed over the past several decades, so too did Louis’s legacy in the city. On Thursday, HBO and Everlast, a company that specializes in boxing equipment, took a step toward rekindling the memory of Louis in New York City. They opened the Joe Louis Boxing Gym in the basement of the Police Athletic League building on Manhattan Avenue near 119th Street in Harlem. “I think it’s a wonderful tribute to my father,” Joe Louis Barrow Jr., Louis’s son, said by telephone. “It will continue to keep the Joe Louis connection to New York, and specifically Harlem.” Though he was born, as Joe Louis Barrow, in Chambers County, Ala., and lived most of his life in Detroit and Chicago, Louis rose to international prominence in New York. Louis’s first fight in New York was in 1935. His promoter brought him to the city because the owners of Madison Square Garden controlled the heavyweight title and he wanted to get his fighter a shot. Louis lost his first fight against Schmeling, who was from Germany, at Yankee Stadium in 1936. A year later, he won the heavyweight title for the first time, by knocking out Jim Braddock in Chicago, and returned to New York to defend his title. In 1938 came a highly anticipated rematch against Schmeling. This fight, also at Yankee Stadium, was billed as the United States versus Nazi Germany. It was a black American, of all people, carrying the torch for a country that was deeply segregated. Mr. Barrow called his father one of the true pioneers of race relations in the United States, saying that even white Americans cheered for him. “That was the single event that allowed him to transcend from a heavyweight champion to a true American hero,” Mr. Barrow said of the rematch. Louis knocked out Schmeling in the first round, and the streets of Harlem erupted. According to an article in The New York Times the day after the fight, people jumped on cars and pushed over traffic signs. The police commissioner ordered officers to reroute traffic on Seventh Avenue between 125th and 145th Streets, saying, “This is their night, let them have their fun.” People raced to the Hotel Theresa on the corner of 125th Street and Seventh Avenue, now known as Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, trying to catch a glimpse of Louis returning from the fight. “It was madness when the fight was over,” Mr. Rangel said. Still, The Times reported, there were only 13 minor injuries and most of the celebration, including the one in Yorkville, the German-American quarter around East 86th Street, was peaceful. Louis, who died in 1981, later said a farewell of sorts to New York. In 1951, he was knocked out by the much younger Rocky Marciano at Madison Square Garden in his final professional bout. Many of Louis’s accomplishments in New York are captured in the documentary “Joe Louis: America’s Hero ... Betrayed,” which is to be broadcast on HBO on Saturday night. Today, it is difficult to find a relic of Louis’s time in New York, where he fought more than two dozen times. The area surrounding Madison Square Garden is known as Joe Louis Plaza, as noted on street signs that thousands of New Yorkers probably walk past each day without a glance. The Police Athletic League building in Harlem now has a plaque at its front entrance that reads, “Home of the Joe Louis Boxing Gym.” Inside hangs a painting of Louis by Duhirwe Rushemeza, a Brooklyn-based artist. The newly renovated boxing gym has fluorescent lighting, walls of bright red and glossy gray brick, a new ring with black canvas and a glass case holding pictures of professional boxers like Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield and Zab Judah. Mr. Barrow said his father often reminisced about the time he spent in New York, about the Harlem night life and the people who yearned for just a glimpse of him in the street. “He loved the energy in New York,” Mr. Barrow said. “He loved Harlem particularly because in those days it was a very hopping town. New York was a place where he really made his career.”",

    "source": "Discounts on Hepatitis C Drug Dent Gilead’s Earnings <eos> WASHINGTON — Earnings for Gilead Science tumbled 17 percent in the first quarter as steeper discounts and rebates on its blockbuster hepatitis C drugs cut into sales. Gilead, maker of Harvoni, the first once-daily, single-pill regimen for hepatitis C, said on Thursday that sales of the best-selling drug fell 15 percent to $3 billion in the quarter, with the steepest drop-off in the United States and Japan. The drug maker attributed the decline to discounts given to private insurers and higher rebates for patients in government-controlled health plans like Medicaid. Harvoni’s decline was offset in part by higher sales for an older hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, which grew to $1.28 billion. Gilead, based in Foster City, Calif., has grown into one of the world’s biggest drug makers because of its breakthrough treatments for hepatitis C, a liver-destroying virus estimated to affect about 185 million people worldwide. However, use of the drug has been slowing in the United States, where many of the patients who are eligible and able to afford the drugs have already received them. Additionally, many private insurance plans and government health programs have been limiting which patients they will cover, often waiting until the patients have suffered significant liver damage. But Gilead has also become an unwilling symbol of soaring drug prices because of the high list prices for the hepatitis drugs: about $94,000 for Harvoni and $84,000 for Sovaldi. Insurers in the United States have demanded steep discounts — as much as 45 percent — to cover the two drugs but, even so, the prices strain health care budgets. For the period that ended March 31, the drug maker posted revenue of $7.79 billion . Profit slipped to $2.53 a share, compared with $2.76 in the year earlier period. Adjusted for one-time costs and adjustments the company would have earned $3.03 a share. Gilead sells the top-selling H.I.V. treatments Truvada, Viread and Stribild, and others. Sales of those drugs continued to climb. The company reported $150 million for a single-tablet H.I.V. combination called Genvoya, which was released in November. The company’s shares have fallen 3 percent since the beginning of the year. The stock closed regular trading at $97 and shed more than 5 percent in after-hours trading.",

    "source": "At Season’s Midpoint, Yankees Struggle to Score <eos> BALTIMORE — The tarp was smothering the infield when the Yankees arrived Sunday afternoon at Camden Yards. It appeared to be a gloomy night for baseball, with dark clouds overhead, and the weather made for an easy metaphor. The Yankees have struggled in recent weeks, their prospects dimming by the day. Their meeting with the Orioles was to be their 81st game of the season, marking the midpoint of a trying year. The Yankees entered the game in third place in the American League East, and a glance at a handful of statistics — a collective .240 batting average and 80 home runs, to name two — made it easy to see why they had won just 42 games. Even before the game, the Yankees were assured of having assembled one of their worst first halves in recent history. They were scoring 3.9 runs on eight hits per game. Their O.P.S., a metric that combines on-base percentage and slugging percentage, was .682, which was on pace to be their lowest at a midpoint of a season since 1990, when it was .658. By comparison, the Boston Red Sox are leading the league with an O.P.S. of .795. Not coincidentally, they are in first place. Even when the Yankees were hobbling their way to a 40-41 record through the first half of 2007, they were producing a respectable 5.3 runs per game along with an O.P.S. of .787. Bolstered by improved pitching, that team caught fire over the second half of the season and won 94 games to make the playoffs. And in 2005, the Yankees were 42-39 through 81 games, with a .275 batting average and a lineup that was scoring 5.4 runs per game. They went on to win their division. Manager Joe Girardi continues to be a lonely voice of optimism. He has seen enough solid at-bats, he said before Sunday’s game, to feel confident that the team will improve. Plus, his pitching staff and its 3.86 earned run average had done what it could to keep the team from free-falling through the standings. “We’d like to be in better position, but that’s not the case,” Girardi said, adding, “It should be a very interesting second half.” The Yankees have been hindered by age and injury. Sunday’s lineup was again missing the big-name stars: Derek Jeter, Mark Teixeira, Curtis Granderson and Alex Rodriguez, all sidelined with various ailments. Their replacements went by the names David Adams, Lyle Overbay, Zoilo Almonte and Jayson Nix. Even Travis Hafner, a designated hitter and one of the team’s top off-season acquisitions, was having serious problems at the plate ahead of Sunday’s game, hitting .156 with four home runs since May 22. His woes underscored the team’s inability to hit the baseball very far. “I think you have to have the ability to hit home runs in our division,” Girardi said. “It’s hard when you’re not doing that to score five or six runs a night.” The Yankees last finished out of the playoffs in 2008, when they went 44-37 through their first 81 games. It was Girardi’s first season as manager, and that team also struggled to produce much pop, averaging exactly one home run per game through the first half of the season. For now, Girardi can only hope that his many fill-ins — the Overbays, the Nixes, the Almontes — can do an adequate job until the Jeters and the Grandersons return. “I think it’s probably fair to say it’s not real clear,” Girardi said of the team’s second-half prospects, “because you don’t know exactly when the guys are coming back or how they’re going to feel. You make the assumption that they’re going to come back and be good players. I mean, I make that assumption. There’s nothing that tells me they won’t be.” PHELPS KEEPS ROTATION SPOT Despite getting pummeled by the Orioles in Saturday’s 11-3 loss, David Phelps is keeping his spot in the rotation — for the time being, at least. Girardi said Phelps would start Thursday against the Minnesota Twins, even after he gave up nine runs in two and a third innings. Ivan Nova, who came on in relief and limited the Orioles to two runs in five and two-thirds innings, will continue to throw out of the bullpen, though Girardi said there was a chance he could find Nova a spot “somewhere else.” Nova said: “My mind is just on doing my job. I’ll take advantage of any opportunity that I get.” INSIDE PITCH Entering Sunday’s game, Mariano Rivera had pitched only once since June 22, thanks largely to the team’s losing ways. Joe Girardi said he was not concerned about Rivera’s inactivity. “Mo really knows how to prepare himself,” Girardi said. “When you’ve done it as long as he has, he knows what he needs to do to be sharp. Our biggest concern is always keeping him fresh. We’ve been able to do that for a number of different reasons. The way we’re doing it right now is not my favorite.” ... Girardi said Alex Rodriguez had three hits in six simulated at-bats Sunday at the team’s training complex in Tampa, Fla.",

    "source": "Heavy Lending Creates a Surge in Chinese Economy <eos> BEIJING — The Chinese economy grew faster than expected last month even as inflation slowed, official statistics showed on Friday, as the government continued heavy lending through its state-owned banks to rekindle growth. The latest data, including industrial production, retail sales, fixed-asset investment and electricity generation, were stronger than most economists had anticipated. They presented a consistent picture of an economy that is starting to show real growth again after a very weak spring and summer. “It has become increasingly clear that the Chinese economy is now moving in a better direction,” Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, the central bank, said at a news conference Thursday, before the October figures were publicly released. Bank economists increasingly agree. “October’s growth data delivered pleasant upside surprises across the board, providing fresh evidence that the economy has indeed bottomed out thanks to the filtering through of Beijing’s policy easing,” Sun Junwei, a China economist at HSBC, wrote in a research report Friday afternoon. To be sure, the economic statistics released by the government Friday showed a return to the fairly strong economic expansion that prevailed through much of last year and early this year, and not a return to the torrid, double-digit growth that China has enjoyed for much of the last decade. Australia & New Zealand Banking said in a research note that the latest figures were consistent with 8 percent economic growth in the last quarter of this year and even faster expansion in the first quarter of next year. Growth had weakened to 7.4 percent in the third quarter and 7.6 percent in the second quarter, according to official statistics. Many economists have been suspicious that even the figures from earlier this year might have been overstated, given the weakness in categories like electricity generation, which grew barely at all in the second quarter and only slowly in the third quarter. By contrast, the economic expansion this autumn appears more broadly based. Business executives have begun to describe recovering exports and domestic sales, and cranes have begun moving again on the skylines of big cities like Guangzhou and Beijing. Steel mills and concrete factories are busier. Power generation increased 6.4 percent last month from the same period a year ago, its strongest gain since March, although still well below the double-digit annual gains in previous years. But the renewed growth has been fueled by rapidly mounting debt, as state-owned banks and the central bank have funneled hundreds of billions of dollars in additional lending to state-owned enterprises and government agencies to finance further investment projects. Stock markets in China, Hong Kong, Australia and South Korea were all down about half a percent in late afternoon trading, or about half the loss Thursday on Wall Street, as good news from China seemed to partially offset global worries about the so-called fiscal cliff in the United States and economic troubles in Europe. The Chinese National Bureau of Statistics said Friday that industrial production had risen 9.6 percent in October from the same month a year earlier, compared with 9.2 percent in September and 8.9 percent in August. Retail sales were up 14.5 percent in October from a year earlier, compared with 14.2 percent in September, even though slower inflation at the consumer level was acting as a brake on the increase in retail sales. Fixed-asset investment was up 20.7 percent for the first 10 months of this year, after having been up 20.5 percent for the first nine months of this year. China releases only year-to-date figures for fixed-asset investment, partly because of the difficulty in tracking when money is actually spent on big construction projects. Consumer prices were up only 1.7 percent in October from a year ago, compared with an increase of 1.9 percent in September. Western economists had expected inflation in China to stay steady in October instead of slowing. Producer prices were down 2.8 percent in October from a year ago, a slightly faster pace than the 2.7 percent decrease that economists had expected but not as fast a decline as in September, when they were down 3.6 percent. China has begun a once-a-decade leadership transition at its Party Congress, which began in Beijing on Thursday and will last through the middle of the coming week.",

    "source": "Andy Roddick Talks About His Life After Tennis <eos> Since he retired from professional tennis in 2012, Andy Roddick has talked about all things sports in television studios and podcasts as a broadcaster for Fox Sports 1. He has not, however, done match commentary on the sport he knows best. That will change when he joins the BBC broadcast team for the second week of Wimbledon, where Roddick won plenty of fans but never a title despite three appearances in the singles final. Roddick, 32, was one of the game’s biggest servers and personalities during his career. He remains the last American man to win a Grand Slam singles title, which came at the 2003 United States Open . He and his wife, the actress and model Brooklyn Decker, are expecting their first child later this year. (This interview has been condensed and edited.) Q . So why now? Why the BBC? Why Wimbledon? A. Obviously with ESPN acquiring the Slams, that was never even really a conversation with my situation with Fox. And frankly, I wanted a little bit of space, and the opportunity to dive in and do other sports was appealing to me when I first stopped. I felt like that was a pretty unique offer for me and not one that normally presents itself to a tennis guy. As far as BBC, I told Brook for a long time that that was probably the only job I’d want to do as far as commentary, at least right now, just because of the prestige of it. I’ve had a love affair with Wimbledon for a long time. Q. What kind of tennis commentator do you want to be? A. I don’t know that I want to think about it that much. One of the things I’m lucky to have now, I’ve still played against 90 percent of these guys. I can talk about situational matchups, the business end of being at Wimbledon, the different kind of pressure that people will face. I have a pretty standard rule even when I’m on Fox. I’m happy to say something, even if it’s negative, as long as I would say it to the person sitting across from me if they were looking me in the eye. And I think that’s fair. I am certainly not going to shy away from anything. Q. What’s the learning curve been like on Fox? A. It’s fun to be around people from other sports and almost watch them watch these sports. You learn more doing that and asking questions, being in a room with baseball players like Frank Thomas and Jimmy Rollins while a World Series game is going on and asking them questions about certain pitch counts and when runners are on and everything else. You learn more in that space than probably anything else. Q. During your career, you would sometimes get exasperated with the media. You have a different perspective on that now that you’re a part of it? A. Not really. I always got the American tennis thing, and I feel like I answered it with an uptick in my voice 90 percent of the time, and on the days when I didn’t, well, everybody has bad days, right? The Monday morning quarterback thing ticked me off because everyone kind of knows a game plan, but I still just never underestimate how hard it is to execute something. I guess my frustration came from being a top-five guy in the world and having someone who hasn’t actually played tennis telling me how I should have played the match. That just ticked me off to no end and, frankly, that probably still would. Q. After three years away, you’re heading back to your old workplace. Do you feel you have enough distance now? Are you going to feel comfortable in a different role? A. I don’t know that I was ever going to be the guy who needed to go and be at every tennis event when he retired. I think I’ve been to two matches just because I had to do some sponsor stuff on tour, but I never stopped watching tennis. I never stopped playing when guys are through town. I never stopped talking about tennis. I still get calls all the time from guys on tour if they want to just rap about something or need a scouting report for someone I’ve played. So being visible and still being involved in tennis are two different things. Q. What images stick with you from Wimbledon? A. I still get asked about Wimbledon every two days of my life from somebody. I have zero bitterness about it all. I really don’t. It’s the place where I have some of my biggest heartbreak, but I certainly appreciated even the chance to get after it. I don’t harbor any weird feelings. That’s the biggest hole in my résumé. It’s one that I wish I could fill. I’m certainly aware of all the ramifications from it, but I don’t have a lot of pain from it. When I think of Wimbledon, my favorite time was the practice week when you could walk to the venue without anybody there and you didn’t have to take the tunnels underneath. And just every single year the first walk from the locker room out to Aorangi Park and back, it just floored me every year with the gravity of the place. I got all things Wimbledon from a very early age and always appreciated it. Q . Watching Novak Djokovic get that extended ovation after losing the French Open to Stan Wawrinka this year, I flashed back to the Wimbledon crowd’s reaction to you after losing the marathon to Roger Federer in 2009 . Did that cross your mind? A. It’s a feeling of respect, which is really meaningful in a moment like that. After I lost ’09 Wimbledon, in the moment the only thing I was thinking was: Don’t break down, don’t break down, just get through it. Because I knew once I started a little bit I was going to start sobbing uncontrollably, which I didn’t want. So the crowd tested me with that respect and with that ovation, and it does mean a lot. Athletes tend to get melodramatic in moments, but Novak, from what I heard, showed his appreciation, and that will serve him well as far as the way he’s perceived publicly. He showed something beyond being the No. 1 player in the world who is going about his business and kind of seems immune to everything. Frankly, it’s just nice to see a human moment after something like that. Q . You are 32. Federer is close to turning 34. Ivo Karlovic, who is 36, just reached the semifinals in Halle with his big serve. Honestly, do you ever have any second thoughts? A . [Long pause.] This is just a moment of honesty. Once I stopped believing I could win a major, I didn’t want to continue. I won two of my last five events on tour, and you hate to say that wasn’t enough because you want to respect people that that would be a dream summer for. But it changed the way I wanted to be able to play a little bit. For me, going out and playing guys in practice sets that are still 30, 40, 50 in the world and kind of getting a barometer of where I would be, that is kind of enough for me. I have a pretty good understanding of where I would lay in the landscape of tennis right now. Six Players to Watch at Wimbledon Geoff Macdonald, the women’s tennis coach at Vanderbilt University, analyzes which players have made a strong impression heading to the All England Lawn Tennis Club. Q. And it wouldn’t be deep in the second week of a major? A. Deep is one thing. Getting to the second week is fine. But I don’t know how that changes my legacy. Wait, legacy is too big a word for me. How about my history in tennis? I don’t know how that changes anything. You are putting in 45 weeks and to stay in neutral, I don’t know that that’s what I wanted. I would never want to coast home. The way that I kind of narrowed talent margins with the guys I was trying to beat — and I didn’t beat them very often — was just through working and being a psychopath about that. At a certain point, my body couldn’t do it. You look at Jim Courier. He did the same thing. Lleyton Hewitt did the same thing, and his body has been touch-and-go for a while. You are starting to see it with Rafa [Nadal] a little bit more maybe. It takes its toll with the guys who kind of have to narrow the margin by being physical. I don’t have any regrets about when I walked away. Do I have an ego about playing guys now that are ranked a certain level and still wanting to beat them? Yes, absolutely. Do I feel great when it works out on a given day? Yes, I feel fantastic about it. I love it. Have I ever toyed with going back and doing it full time? I have not. Q . You’re playing doubles with Mardy Fish in Atlanta next month. But no singles wild card? No cameo? A. Frankly, if I could go play a challenger or a small tour event without the fallout of what it would take publicly; if I could put on a mask and go play a challenger, that would be awesome. I would love it because I love playing and I love the competition, but dealing with everything else that would go along with it, I’m not sure that it would be worth it to have a good time Q. Still, as innately competitive as you are, it must be strange to watch tennis knowing that you could still be out there? A. It is and it isn’t. Beating a guy handily who is 60 in the world is a lot different than trying to play in the semis of a Grand Slam. So one makes me very happy, and I like it. It’s fun. I have an ego, but the reality of being able to do it time and time again is different. Every time I watch a Wawrinka-Djokovic final I’m going, “I’m soooo good where I’m at.” Q. Fifty-shot rallies can do that to a man. A. We are good here. Retirement is fantastic. Q . Are you surprised, three years after you stopped, that Federer is still No. 2 at his age? A. No, because unlike most people I never compared myself to Roger. It’s phenomenal, and it’s kind of what we were talking about earlier with the guys who are so physical and have to consciously try to do things. With Roger, it just seems like he thinks it, and it happens. It’s an insane ability. The racket in his hand seems to just make sense. I don’t think he’s as fast as he was in his prime. I don’t think a lot of the strokes are as good as they were in his prime, but he’s just such a good tennis player, and as long as he’s healthy he can figure it out. He can mix up his game on a given day. As long as someone is not just overpowering him like Stan did in Paris, Roger has so many options that he’s going to figure out how to beat people as long as they don’t come out and just throw haymakers and land them. Q . How about that other 33-year-old, your friend Serena Williams? A . The French Open might have been her most impressive Slam, because she didn’t have her A game and she might not have had her B game. It’s like when you see a pitcher pitch a good ballgame, give up some hits but not get burned on the scoreboard. I feel like that’s what she did, and if she’s the person who can do that now consistently and get through like she did in Paris, the only thing that makes us say, “How much longer does she have?” is her age. Nothing about her game suggests it. She hasn’t really lost anything as far as weight of shot, movement, anything. Q . I was watching your fellow Nebraskan, Jack Sock, reach the fourth round at the French Open and it struck me that the pressure on you following up on the Sampras-Agassi-Courier generation was so great, but enough time has gone by that the pressure on this next generation of American players seems much lighter. People are relieved to see any kind of young, promising American talent at this stage. A . Frankly the shadow of Andre, Pete, [Michael] Chang and Courier is a lot longer than my shadow, and for good reason. When I would lose in a Wimbledon final, it was generally viewed as a massive disappointment. If Jack made the semis of a Slam, it would be viewed as a massive, massive, massive win. And that’s a good thing for him. I just had fun watching him because I feel like there’s a sense of belief. I don’t feel like he’s scared of expectation now. I loved the fact that he got a terrible draw in Paris and went out and just owned it. It’s exciting to watch him. There’s no reason he can’t get into that top 10. Q . You essentially launched this “supercoach” trend when you hired Jimmy Connors. How do you feel about the fact that it has become so prevalent now? And does the fact that the two-coach model now exists give you any desire to play that role for a player in the future? A . Not surprising for top players to rely on the .000001 percent of tennis people who can relate to what they’re trying to achieve. I don’t have any interest in coaching like that right now. Q. Have you been able to get any of the structure or adrenaline rush that you got from the tour from what you’ve done afterward? A . I will never ever in my life replace that first 30 seconds after winning a big match. That’s gone. That’s not coming back. That adrenaline rush doesn’t exist for me anymore, although that’s before fatherhood. So I know I might want to walk that statement back in the next six months. But at this point, three years gone by, I don’t think I ever expected anything to replace that. Thankfully, I had it for the moments I did, but at no point in my life did I think playing golf was going to equate with winning a Wimbledon semifinal. Where the margins are filled is not with adrenaline. It’s time with friends, being able to have a glass of wine over dinner and have a legitimate conversation. On tour, every single meal I was so high-strung and intense, I’d be in and out of dinner in 45 minutes. Very rushed, selfish, next thing, next-thing kinds of obsessions. In my opinion, you lose the adrenaline moments, but you gain the quiet moments.",

    "source": "In Troubled Era, Housing Chief in Newark Sets His Retirement <eos> The executive director of the Newark Housing Authority, whose agency was ranked among the nation's worst performers after a federal investigation last year found widespread mismanagement, will retire next month, according to the authority's commissioners. The director, Harold Lucas, 61, will leave his post Feb. 10, the commissioners said, after nine years leading the authority, first from 1992-98, and again starting in 2002 after a stint as assistant secretary of Public and Indian Housing in Washington, D.C. Zinnerford Smith, chairman of the authority's board, said in a statement yesterday that Mr. Lucas \"will be sorely missed,\" specifically citing the construction of new town houses under Mr. Lucas's direction. But according to some city officials, residents of public housing and former Housing Authority employees, Mr. Lucas's retirement -- announced a day after the commissioners held their monthly board meeting -- has more to do with his failures than his triumphs. \" 'Retirement' is an excuse,\" said Augusto Amador, a councilman representing the city's East Ward. \"The pressure from either the federal government's housing office, or other federal entities, is enormous and therefore it has forced him to resign.\" A new federal audit is expected to be released in early February, said Michael Zerega, a spokesman for the HUD Office of Inspector General, around the time of Mr. Lucas's retirement date. One person familiar with the report said it would examine the use of authority money by the city. Mr. Lucas did not return several telephone calls seeking comment, nor did Mr. Smith or another commissioner, Fran Adubato. On Thursday night, a woman at Mr. Lucas's East Orange home who did not identify herself, said: : \"He did not resign. He was not asked to leave.\" Mayor Sharpe James, who has been close to Mr. Lucas since the 1980's, also did not return calls seeking comment. On Thursday, at his annual fund-raising gala, Mr. James said that asking Mr. Lucas to leave his post was \"the farthest thing from my mind.\" The trouble for Mr. Lucas, who has been working on and off with housing development in Newark since the 1970's, began last September when the authority laid off 84 people while completing a $1 million renovation of its headquarters. The New York Times reported at the time that the renovation included the purchase of a plasma television for an executive dining room and more than $14,000 in audio-visual equipment for the authority's main office. According to internal authority documents, four of Mr. Lucas's close relatives also worked for the agency, and the authority had awarded a contract for up to $25,000 to a nonprofit organization run by Mr. Lucas's daughter. His annual salary of more than $185,000 made him the city's highest-paid employee, according to the mayor. In October 2004, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and its inspector general's office began two separate reviews that found what officials called \"very serious\" problems with how the Newark agency was run. The reports, released in April and May, found that the authority frequently miscalculated rents, failed to inspect and maintain its properties, and illegally used $3.9 million meant for a rent assistance program to buy property in 2003 near the site of a downtown arena now being built for the New Jersey Devils, the professional hockey team. The authority restored the $3.9 million last spring, while Mr. Lucas personally paid $2,850 to cover the cost of the plasma television. Hector Corchado, a councilman representing the North Ward, said that Mr. Lucas' departure gave the authority an opportunity to turn itself around. \"It's an extremely important step that will have an impact in the community,\" Mr. Corchado said. \"We've had a lot of allegations made and people felt things were not being done for the residents. This will give the city and the housing authority a chance to get a new start.\" But Mr. Amador and former employees like Nelson Nieves, one of the 84 people laid off in 2004, disagreed. Noting that the April HUD report said that the authority's six commissioners -- who have served an average of nine and a half years and are appointed by the mayor -- should be subject to shorter fixed terms, Mr. Amador and Mr. Nieves said that a broader overhaul was necessary.",

    "source": "Anthony Marshall Convicted of Larceny in Astor Case <eos> The son of Brooke Astor , the philanthropist and long-reigning matriarch of New York society, was convicted in Manhattan on Thursday on charges that he defrauded his mother and stole tens of millions of dollars from her as she suffered from Alzheimer’s disease in the twilight of her life. The jury’s verdict means that Mrs. Astor’s son, Anthony D. Marshall , 85, faces a sentence of at least a year and as many as 25 years. A co-defendant, Francis X. Morrissey Jr., a lawyer who did estate planning for Mrs. Astor, was also convicted of a series of fraud and conspiracy charges, as well as one count of forging Mrs. Astor’s signature on an amendment to her will. The verdict drew the curtain on a long trial that cast an unflattering spotlight on one of New York’s first families of high society. Henry Kissinger, Barbara Walters and Annette de la Renta, among others, testified that Mr. Marshall mistreated his mother in her later years and conspired to inflate his inheritance from her estate — largely to appease his wife, Charlene Marshall. Mrs. Astor died in 2007 at age 105. As the verdict was read, Ms. Marshall sat stone-faced; moments later, while her husband went to meet with a probation officer, she left the courtroom, saying, “I love my husband.” She and Mr. Marshall then held hands and ignored requests for comment before being whisked away in a black Town Car. Although prosecutors were still determining how stiff a sentence to recommend, they gave a hint after the verdict was read, when Elizabeth Loewy, an assistant district attorney, asked Justice A. Kirke Bartley Jr. to increase the defendants’ bail to $5 million from $100,000. Justice Bartley denied the request, and asked the defendants to return Dec. 8 for sentencing. Mr. Marshall and Mr. Morrissey, 66, staggered ashen-faced out of the courtroom without comment. The defense is expected to ask the judge to allow Mr. Marshall to stay out of prison pending an appeal, which could take more than a year because of a long trial — more than 19 weeks — that produced about 18,000 pages of transcript and thousands more pages of exhibits. “I’m stunned by the verdict, greatly disappointed with what the jury did,” Frederick P. Hafetz, one of Mr. Marshall’s lawyers, said outside the courthouse. “I think we have a strong appeal.” Mr. Hafetz did not elaborate on what the grounds might be, but motions by the defense lawyers throughout the trial offered some insight into what their next moves might be. They are likely to keep a close eye on what jurors say in the coming days, particularly in relation to one woman who had asked to be removed from the panel this week because she said she felt threatened by another juror’s comments. The defense may also challenge the judge’s decision to allow an independent expert on trusts and estates law to testify for the prosecution, as well as the strength of the evidence in the most serious charge Mr. Marshall was convicted of — first-degree grand larceny, for giving himself a retroactive lump-sum raise of about $1 million for managing his mother’s finances. Mr. Marshall was found guilty of 14 of the 16 counts against him. One of the acquittals was on the other first-degree grand larceny charge, for selling a Childe Hassam painting that his mother owned for $10 million and keeping a $2 million commission on the sale. The other was on a lesser charge of falsifying business records. The jury of eight women and four men sat through months of testimony and arguments in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, hearing detailed accounts of Mrs. Astor’s luxurious life of summers on an estate in Maine and dinners with diplomats. Deliberations went on for 12 days, and appeared strained. Thursday’s developments drew reactions from throughout the social stratosphere in which Mrs. Astor traveled. “The only reason we got involved in Mrs. Astor’s treatment was to ensure she lived the last months of her life in comfort and peace,” Mrs. de la Renta and David Rockefeller said in a joint statement released by their spokesman, Fraser P. Seitel. Three years ago, Mrs. de la Renta and Mr. Rockefeller helped put together the guardianship petition that first accused Mr. Marshall of mistreating his mother. “Thankfully that was accomplished,” the statement said. Betsy Gotbaum, the city’s public advocate and a friend of Mrs. Astor, testified for the prosecution and said that Mrs. Astor deserved better treatment from her son. “Clearly, the jury thought he did something wrong,” Ms. Gotbaum said. “I don’t think he should go to jail, frankly. He’s 85 years old. I think he’s probably suffered enough.” At its core, this case was a story of familial dysfunction, provoked in part by Mr. Marshall’s son Philip, who filed the guardianship petition three years ago. Philip Marshall was not in court on Thursday, but reacted with disbelief when told by a reporter of the verdict. “Oh my God,” he said. “Wow. Wow.” In a statement released later, he only indirectly mentioned his feelings toward his father. “I hope this brings some consolation and closure for the many people, including my grandmother’s loyal staff, caregivers and friends, who helped when she was so vulnerable and so manipulated,” he said. The prosecution portrayed Mr. Marshall as driven to squeeze his mother for money at the urging of his wife. Because many of the convictions were related to changes to Mrs. Astor’s will that prosecutors said the defendants procured through fraud, Mr. Marshall would seem to be compromised when the battle over Mrs. Astor’s estate — worth more than $180 million when she died two years ago — shifts to Surrogate’s Court in Westchester County. Of the changes to the will, prosecutors vigorously objected to one executed in January 2004 that gave Mr. Marshall outright control of $60 million of his mother’s estate upon her death. Paul Saunders, a lawyer for Mrs. de la Renta, said the main defense argument — that Mrs. Astor understood and consented to what her son was doing — had been undermined by the criminal verdict. “The jury clearly found that she did not,” he said. “That’s important because her mental capacity is the central issue in the will contest.” Much of the contention centered on when Mrs. Astor lost her competency. Some jurors concluded that did not occur until 2005, while others, like Yvonne Fernandez, believed it happened as early as 2002. One of the major points of discussion was the issue of the $1 million retroactive raise, with jurors eventually deciding that Mr. Marshall misused his power of attorney to take that raise. “How can he give himself a raise when he’s been abusing his power?” Ms. Fernandez said. “He was wearing two hats at that point.” The defense may argue on appeal that, by the letter of the law, the power of attorney gave Mr. Marshall the right to give himself that raise. When asked about the likelihood of Mr. Marshall’s serving time in prison, Ms. Fernandez said: “It is what it is. You make mistakes in life and you’ve got to take responsibility for them.”",

    "source": "Disciplined Giants Beat Lions for Third Consecutive Victory <eos> EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — On the field before Sunday’s game, the Giants welcomed several dozen former players, a lineage that stretched from Andy Robustelli to Amani Toomer. Standing together, they represented decades of intimidating defense, a sturdy rushing attack and a timely, if controlled, passing game. Theirs was a methodical style of play, even predictable, and if it seems like something from another era, the game that ensued at New Meadowlands Stadium proved otherwise. With a smothering defense and a patient offense, the Giants won their third consecutive game, taking an early lead against the outmanned Detroit Lions , and holding on for a 28-20 victory . In contrast to the sloppy play that marked the team during its stumbling 1-2 start, the Giants’ offense had no turnovers and just two penalties. It showed a measured and prized balance, with the team’s 334 total yards evenly split between the run and the pass. And the pass rush once again knocked a quarterback out of the game — for the fourth time this season. “I think we are starting to understand what we can and cannot do as a team,” said quarterback Eli Manning, who completed 20 of 30 passes for 177 yards and 2 touchdowns. “We’re starting to understand how we play, which means not hurting ourselves with turnovers and sometimes not trying to do too much. It’s a kind of smart, patient style of play.” Manning’s words probably could have been echoed by many of his Giants predecessors at quarterback, from Simms to Conerly. Giants Coach Tom Coughlin, who was raised in upstate New York watching old-school Giants football, knew he was watching a modern equivalent of a familiar model. “It is a lot of hard work — stop the run, protect the ball,” he said. “We’ve battled our way back to 4-2.” While the Lions (1-5) were hardly the strongest measuring stick — they have lost 24 consecutive road games — the Giants have in the last three weeks turned their greatest weaknesses into strengths. The pass rush that had seemed lackluster is now a peril to every quarterback in its way. Detroit quarterback Shaun Hill was knocked down on nearly every pass play until late in the first half, when he left the game with a broken left arm. His backup, Drew Stanton, played well, but he also almost had to leave the game when he was slammed to the ground in the fourth quarter. The Giants’ safeties, who made up perhaps the weakest part of last season’s team and who appeared out of sync earlier this year, have since banded together as a perfect complement to the defensive front. Safeties Kenny Phillips, Deon Grant and Antrel Rolle combined for 23 tackles, and Rolle intercepted a pass late in the game to thwart Detroit’s last rally. When the Giants were 1-2, there was no player seemingly more out of sorts than running back Brandon Jacobs, who was unproductive and chafing at his second-string status. On Sunday, Jacobs blasted through for two short touchdowns and professed his happiness, even though the new starter Ahmad Bradshaw got the bulk of the carries (19) and rushing yards (133). “If I punch two into the end zone and we win,” Jacobs said, “I’m good with that.” An obvious part of the production by both Jacobs and Bradshaw was the Giants’ offensive line — also maligned three weeks ago. Center Shaun O’Hara returned from injury, and the unit played with aggression and cohesion. And finally, Manning, plagued by quirky turnovers in the opening games of the season, had a precise, deliberate game. He found an old target, connecting with Steve Smith six times, and moved the ball around to seven receivers. “Sometimes it’s about being willing to wait for the big plays to present themselves,” Manning said. “You can’t force it. You can’t try to score a touchdown on every play.” The one past problem that seemed to resurface for the Giants was the woes enveloping the rookie punter Matt Dodge, who dropped the ball attempting his first punt not once, but twice. That miscue led to an early 7-0 Lions lead, although Dodge did kick well for the rest of the game. Jacobs’s first touchdown tied the game, and Manning found an open Mario Manningham over the middle for a 33-yard touchdown in the second quarter. The Giants never relinquished the lead, even though the Lions cut the deficit to 4 early in the fourth quarter. But Grant forced and recovered a fumble that led to a spectacular, and increasingly typical, Bradshaw run. He made several cutbacks and changed speeds once or twice before being corralled 45 yards down the field . Jacobs’s second touchdown followed, restoring the Giants lead to double digits. Next up will be a Monday night game against the Dallas Cowboys on Oct. 25. Asked to assess the season, Coughlin wondered if he could have some things back and make the Giants record 6-0, then added: “But we’re not 6-0. We’re 4-2. We are controlling the things we can control, and let’s hope we keep it going.” Manning, a man of few words, had his own version. “Slow start,” he said. “More consistent now.” EXTRA POINTS In their new stadium, Tom Coughlin used to address reporters in a large glass-walled room that allowed certain fans to view, listen — and sometimes boo — as he made his postgame comments. On Sunday, for the first time, Coughlin talked to the news media in a small windowless room across the hall from the team’s locker room. The Giants said they would soon construct a new room for postgame news conferences, one away from the glass-lined setting. “I like the close quarters,” Coughlin said with a smile when asked of the switch. “It’s family like.”",

    "source": "Is Messi the Heir Argentina Seeks? <eos> JOHANNESBURG — Argentina may not win this World Cup, but it will pose one of the most intriguing human questions of the tournament: Can Diego Maradona manage Lionel Messi ? Maradona is Argentina’s coach, giving Messi, the team’s star, a free role in their opening World Cup match against Nigeria in Johannesburg on Saturday. They were both small boys, but people observed in their childhood that they were destined to become soccer greats. Maradona led Argentina to victory in the World Cup in 1986, and put himself up there with Pelé, Cruyff, Zidane and another Argentine, Alfredo di Stefano, as the best players of all time. Messi could earn a place in that quintet. He has the talent, the speed, the balance, the beauty of movement, the ability to outwit an entire defense and score goals. But that is the Messi of F.C. Barcelona. The Messi of Argentina has not looked the same game winner, or even a player sure of his place on the national team. The paradox has grown since Maradona became the national team coach in November 2008. The country’s aging soccer president, Julio Grondona, gambled everything on a hunch that genius would feed off genius. He presumed that, if anyone could understand what Messi needed to fulfill his pressurized role, it could be Maradona. There has been little evidence to date that Maradona, the nation’s fallen idol, knows how to convert performance into sage team management. This is unsurprising, given that his fame, and sometimes notoriety, relied heavily on his doing things without really thinking how he did them. If there is such a thing as a sports genius, Maradona looked the part — as a player. There are signs of Messi growing into a similar role. He shines for Barcelona, but seems lost, almost forlorn, with Argentina. Messi is trying hard, no question, but why has this dichotomy emerged? If soccer is so simple a game, why does suspicion arise between two men who presumably want the same thing? The situation is the more remarkable because Argentina has at its disposal seven exciting goal-scorers — more than any other country, Brazil included. What Argentina lacks is team mentality. Maradona was made national coach without even a basic apprenticeship in management. The most telling perspective on this has been made by Cesar Menotti, who coached Argentina to win the 1978 World Cup. “Things are completely different,” Menotti said last year. “Messi started as a boy with Barcelona. He came onto the bench, then he was allowed to play a few minutes before claiming a regular place.” “Messi is not responsible for the strategy at Barcelona,” he added. “That is Iniesta and Xavi. Messi is the one that completes the moves. Argentina, however, expects Messi to cope with the strategy of the team, to create goals, score goals, to do everything.” The end result, Menotti said, is, “With Barcelona, Messi plays. With Argentina, he runs.” So has Messi become part of the problem, rather than the solution to Argentina’s puzzle? It would be too harsh to suggest Messi lacks the savvy of Maradona in his time. Messi is still only 22, and at that age Maradona crashed out of the 1982 World Cup when he was red-carded for a willful two-footed kick back against a Brazilian. Maradona atoned by inspiring Argentina to win the next World Cup. By then, Maradona was the best he would ever be. He was mature, mischievous and masterful, and he carried his country with him. If Messi were to replicate that now, he would be ahead of schedule. But he couldn’t do it alone, and Argentina needs to find better balance between attack and defense. Maradona must quickly create a group ambiance. He is not the star performer any longer, and he has to trust the one who should be. Maradona says he urges his players: “Thirty days of sacrifice for the chance to kiss the World Cup is nothing in the life of a man. An achievement like this is like touching the sky. I played in two World Cups; I earned the right to talk on this subject.” There is a sense that the further Argentina goes in this tournament, the closer Messi might come to emulating Maradona. There is the hope that there is no suppressed resentment from the coach because of Messi’s youth and his untarnished reputation. For all that draws them together, Messi will never be Maradona. They are different men, from different backgrounds. It is 300 kilometers, or 185 miles, from Buenos Aires, where Maradona grew up, to Rosario, the birthplace of Messi. There was a world of difference in their childhoods. The Messis were not rich, but not dirt poor like the Maradonas. The Las Heras neighborhood of Rosario, where young Messi could run free with a ball, bears no comparison with Villa Miseria Fiorito, the barrio where Maradona learned his values. Diego’s father earned a meager living in the bone yard of a carcass factory over the ridge from their tiny house. Diego’s skills were honed where running water carried waste from the sewer into the gutter. Messi’s childhood is pleasingly captured in “Los Origines de Messi,” a documentary from 2003. It visits the primary school, the home, and the first club where the fledgling Messi emerged. Several things stand out in that film. Messi’s love of soccer was first fostered by his maternal grandmother, who taught preschool youngsters to play soccer and who took her 4-year-old grandson by the hand to a dusty compound. There, she persuaded the coach that the child was stronger than he looked. “I opened the door,” said the coach, Salvador Aparicio. “He came in. His first touch astonished me. He dribbled all the time, I called out ‘Kick it, kick it!’ He was too nice.” Few in Villa Miseria Fiorito described Maradona in such terms. To this day, Maradona looks for fighting spirit in his men, but in the news conference before the game Saturday against Nigeria, Maradona acknowledged Messi’s value. “Thank God he’s an Argentine,” he said. “We are hungry for glory. I see it similar to ’86. Besides, Messi arrives better than I was.” Perhaps, too, Messi was never quite the angel he appeared to be. His primary school teachers tell of a boy impossible to keep out of the playground, a boy whose blank exam papers were filled in by a girlfriend.",

    "source": "In China, Jeers and Cheers for ‘Kung Fu Panda’ <eos> Sometimes it is important to take a political stand. And sometimes it is just fun to watch a cartoon panda trying to do kung fu. Despite calls in China to boycott “Kung Fu Panda,” the animated movie about a panda with a passion for martial arts has become a huge box office hit. The film, from DreamWorks Animation and Paramount Pictures, has already grossed over $12 million after less than two weeks in release, making the film’s opening one of the strongest in China in recent years. Globally, the movie has brought in $275 million, Paramount said Sunday. Some Chinese critics had asked consumers to protest the film because Steven Spielberg, a top executive at DreamWorks, resigned last February as artistic adviser to the 2008 Beijing Olympics after failing to persuade Chinese officials to do more in the Darfur region of Sudan. Another group, backed by the Chinese artist Zhao Bandi, who uses pandas as an inspiration for his work, also called for a boycott, saying the animated film is exploiting a national symbol. But on June 21 the film opened to huge crowds in Beijing, Shanghai and other big cities. Chinese audiences have praised the quality of the film’s animation and its colorful and clever depiction of various aspects of ancient Chinese culture, architecture and scenery. The release of the film was postponed in Sichuan Province, the country’s largest panda-breeding center and the site of a devastating earthquake that killed over 69,000 people last month. One reason for the delay was the sensitivities involved in a region that is still in mourning. But after the film opened there last week, theater operators said their houses were packed. “It is the most successful animation movie in our cinema history,” said Li Jiqing, general manager at Wangfujing Cinema in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province. “The box office has done as well as the ‘Matrix,’ ‘Lord of the Rings’ and ‘Pirates of the Caribbean.’ ” In China, a film that earns more than $15 million is generally considered a blockbuster, since ticket prices are often just $4 and film piracy is rampant. One of the highest grossing films ever in China was “Transformers,” which earned about $42 million last year. But each year, only a handful of films earn over $15 million. The American producers of “Kung Fu Panda,” which is set in the Li River Valley in the Guangxi Province of southwestern China, have called the movie a salute to Chinese culture and to Hong Kong martial arts films. News shows and Internet bloggers in China are now debating the merits of the film and asking why Chinese filmmakers and animators are being outdone by foreign producers, who have created compelling images of ancient Chinese palaces and temples and turned their cuddly national icon into a Hollywood darling.

    "source": "2 Blasts at Boston Marathon Kill at Least 3 and Injure More Than 100 <eos> BOSTON — Two powerful bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday afternoon, killing three people, including an 8-year-old child, and injuring more than 100, as one of this city’s most cherished rites of spring was transformed from a scene of cheers and sweaty triumph to one of screams and carnage. Almost three-quarters of the 23,000 runners who participated in the race had already crossed the finish line when a bomb that had apparently been placed in a garbage can exploded around 2:50 p.m. in a haze of smoke amid a crowd of spectators on Boylston Street, just off Copley Square in the heart of the city. Thirteen seconds later, another bomb exploded several hundred feet away. Pandemonium erupted as panicked runners and spectators scattered, and rescue workers rushed in to care for the dozens of maimed and injured, some of whom lost legs in the blast, witnesses said. The F.B.I. took the lead role in the investigation on Monday night, and Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the bureau’s Boston office, described the inquiry at a news conference as “a criminal investigation that is a potential terrorist investigation.” The reverberations were felt far outside the city, with officials in New York and Washington stepping up security at important locations. Near the White House, the Secret Service cordoned off Pennsylvania Avenue out of what one official described as “an abundance of caution.” President Obama, speaking at the White House, vowed to bring those responsible for the blasts to justice. “We will get to the bottom of this,” the president said. “We will find who did this, and we will find out why they did this. Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.” Mr. Obama did not refer to the attacks as an act of terrorism, and he cautioned people from “jumping to conclusions” based on incomplete information. But a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity afterward, said, “Any event with multiple explosive devices — as this appears to be — is clearly an act of terror, and will be approached as an act of terror.” “However,” the official added, “we don’t yet know who carried out this attack, and a thorough investigation will have to determine whether it was planned and carried out by a terrorist group, foreign or domestic.” Image Pandemonium erupted as runners and spectators scattered after the blasts. Credit Kenshin Okubo/The Daily Free Press, via Associated Press Some runners were approaching the end of the 26.2-mile race when the two blasts, in rapid succession, sent them running away from the finish line. “The first one went off, I thought it was a big celebratory thing, and I just kept going,” recalled Jarrett Sylvester, 26, a runner from East Boston, who said it had sounded like a cannon blast. “And then the second one went off, and I saw debris fly in the air. And I realized it was a bomb at that point. And I just took off and ran in the complete opposite direction.” There were conflicting reports about how many devices there were. One law enforcement official said there had been four: the two that exploded at the marathon and two others that were disabled by the police. The official said that the devices appeared to have been made with black powder and ball bearings, but that investigators were unsure how the two that exploded had been set off. It was unclear Monday evening who might be responsible for the blast. Although investigators said that they were speaking to a Saudi citizen who was injured in the blast, several law enforcement officials took pains to note that no one was in custody. Some law enforcement officials noted that the blasts came at the start of a week that has sometimes been seen as significant for radical American antigovernment groups: it was the April 15 deadline for filing taxes, and Patriots’ Day in Massachusetts, the start of a week that has seen violence in the past. April 19 is the anniversary of the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The explosive devices used in the attacks on Monday were similar in size to the device used in the 1996 attack at the Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta but were not nearly as large as the one used in Oklahoma City. In the Atlanta attack, a pipe bomb was detonated near pedestrians, killing 2 and injuring more than 100 — similar numbers to Monday’s attack. The attack in Oklahoma City was far larger because the perpetrator used a truck packed with thousands of pounds of explosives. The device killed more than 150 people. Image Site of the Boston Marathon explosions. Credit Aerial image from Pictometry International The attack on Monday occurred in areas that had been largely cleared of vehicles for the marathon. Without vehicles to pack explosives into, the perpetrators would have been forced to rely on much smaller devices. Officials stressed that they had no suspects in the attack. The Saudi man, who was interviewed at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, had been seen running from the scene of the first explosion, a person briefed on preliminary developments in the investigation said on Monday afternoon. A law enforcement official said later Monday that the man, was in the United States on a student visa and came under scrutiny because of his injuries, his proximity to the blasts and his nationality — but added that he was not known to federal authorities and that his role in the attack, if any, was unclear. The explosions brought life in Boston to a halt. Police officials effectively closed a large part of the Back Bay neighborhood, which surrounds the blast site; some transit stops were closed; planes were briefly grounded at Boston Logan International Airport and the Boston Symphony Orchestra canceled its Monday night concert. A Boston Celtics game scheduled for Tuesday was also canceled. Boston was bracing for a heightened law enforcement presence on Tuesday, with its transit riders subject to random checks of their backpacks and bags, and many streets in the center of the city likely to be closed to traffic as the investigation continues. Gov. Deval Patrick said Monday night that “the city of Boston is open and will be open tomorrow, but it will not be business as usual.” Boston’s police commissioner, Ed Davis, urged people to stay off the streets. “We’re recommending to people that they stay home, that if they’re in hotels in the area that they return to their rooms, and that they don’t go any place and congregate in large crowds,” he said at an afternoon news conference. It had begun as a perfect day for the Boston Marathon, one of running’s most storied events, with blue skies and temperatures just shy of 50 degrees. The race typically draws half a million spectators. And long after the world-class runners had finished — the men’s race was won by Lelisa Desisa Benti of Ethiopia, who finished it in 2 hours, 10 minutes and 22 seconds — the sidewalks of Back Bay were still thick with spectators cheering on friends and relatives as they loped, exhausted, toward the finish line. Dr. Natalie Stavas, a pediatric resident at Boston Children’s Hospital, was running in the marathon with her father and was nearing the finish line when the explosions shook the street. Video A runner and bystanders near the explosions at the Boston Marathon describe the blasts and the chaotic scene. “The police were trying to keep us back, but I told them that I was a physician and they let me through,” she recalled in an interview. First she performed CPR on one woman. “She was on the ground, she wasn’t breathing, her legs were pretty much gone,” she said, adding that she feared that the woman had not survived. Then she tried to help a woman with an injury in her groin area, and a man who had lost his foot. Dr. Stavas said she had applied a tourniquet to the man’s leg with someone’s belt. “He was likely in shock,” she said. “He was saying, ‘I’m O.K., doctor, I’m O.K.’ ” “Then ambulances started coming in by the dozen,” she said. The blast was so powerful that it blew out shop windows and damaged a window on the third floor of the Central Library in Copley Square, which was closed to the public for Patriots’ Day. A number of people were taken to Massachusetts General Hospital, said Dr. Alasdair Conn, the hospital’s chief of emergency services — and several had lost their legs. “This is like a bomb explosion we hear about in Baghdad or Israel or other tragic points in the world,” Dr. Conn said. Several children were among the 10 patients who were brought to Boston Children’s Hospital, including a 2-year-old boy with a head injury who was admitted to the medical/surgical intensive care unit. The police faced another problem as they tried to secure the blast scene: many spectators dropped their backpacks and bags as they scattered to safety, and investigators had to treat each abandoned bag as a potential bomb. There were bomb scares at area hotels. At one point in the afternoon, Boston police officials said that they feared that a fire at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum could have been related to the marathon bombs, but they later said it seemed to be unrelated. The Boston police said that they were getting numerous reports of suspicious packages. Asked if they had found all the explosive devices, Mr. Davis, the police commissioner, urged citizens to remain alert and said he was “not prepared to say we’re at ease at this time.”",

    "source": "Bridging Cultures and Finding Self <eos> ISTANBUL — Zemra Acarli is a strong believer in what people in this part of the world call kismet; she believes that certain things are meant to be or to happen. Each person has a destiny, and hers was to create a fashion label that would merge Western and Oriental elements and help women of Anatolian background in Turkey to make a living. “For years I had the feeling that I had not found my happiness, and it was very much connected with the question, ‘Who am I and what is my identity?”’ said Ms. Acarli, 40. Then, in May 2009, she decided — inspired, she said, by her two identities, Turkish and European — to found ZemZem Atelier, which today produces mostly scarves. “ZemZem” is her nickname but also the Turkish name for the holy well in Mecca (sometimes spelled Zamzam). She grew up as the child of Turkish guest workers in Germany , parents who were determined to give her and her brother, five years her junior, the best education available. She was the first student of Turkish origin at a prestigious high school for economics in the city of Friedrichshafen, where she was born. As a result of her upbringing, Ms. Acarli said, “My identity is mixed, and that’s what you can find also in my products.” Her fashion blends Western design and Anatolian handicraft — and she started producing it not primarily to make money (she has her own public relations business, too) but to bridge her two heritages and help women in Turkey. Ms. Acarli started with scarves, each handmade, of fine cotton or silk, because she wanted to show that an object often depicted with negative connotations — or as a symbol of oppression for women — could be a “must have” for women living in the West. “I wanted to show that it can be a very traditional and modern accessory at the same time — each scarf is a cultural ambassador,” Ms. Acarli said. She designs each piece to include some traditional embroidery, crochet or knitting created by women who live on the outskirts of Istanbul. Last year she sold more than 2,000 scarves in Switzerland, Austria and Germany and has received requests from Lebanon and Dubai. Priced between €90 and €450, or $110 and $560, each piece, which can range in size from a narrow oblong to a shawl stretching three meters, or 10 feet, requires two to four days of work. Sixty-five women work for ZemZem, and for many, it is a first job. Although they had sewn, knitted or crocheted for family and friends, it was not easy to persuade them and their husbands to work with her, Ms. Acarli said. “They were very suspicious, wondering, What does this German Turk really want from us?” she said. “They thought I was just fooling around.” Not having been in Turkey for almost 20 years, Ms. Acarli had no idea where to find people of Anatolian background — the only ones she knew could do the handwork she sought — in the sprawl of Istanbul. One afternoon, in a coffee shop, she spotted a house worker with a big mustache of the type common in Anatolia. She introduced herself and asked whether his wife knew traditional handicrafts. And it was that moment of kismet that produced her first employee. The man, Seyit Cavdarli, invited Ms. Acarli home to meet his wife, Nazli Cavdarli, 34. She had finished high school but was not allowed to study far away from home, ending any opportunity to further education. She had never worked before ZemZem; even now, she says, she is happy to combine that work with being a homemaker. She and her husband have one son, now 13, and live in Samatya, near Istanbul. At the beginning, she said, she was suspicious when her husband invited this unmarried woman, who spoke only broken Turkish, to their home. Where she was raised, men do not usually invite strange women to the private home. “I was wondering, ‘What is this about, and is Zemra really interested in the handicraft?’ But when I saw how happy she was when I showed her the tablecloths and other things I had worked on, I was fascinated by the positive energy and spirit she had,” Mrs. Cavdarli said. She married at 18, and although it was an arranged match, she and her husband fell in love, she said. Since then, she has dedicated her life to housework and her family. Now, with the money she is earning, Mrs. Cavdarli feels some independence for the first time in her life. “Having my own bank account and money is just an incredible feeling, and now I am also able to support my husband paying back bills and debts,” she said. Ms. Acarli had to drink many teas and Turkish coffees at women’s homes and negotiate with their husbands about things like opening bank accounts for the women. Most husbands feared that their wives’ working with ZemZem would interfere with family life. “It was very important for the men to know that their women would work from home and would still be able to take care of their children and of them,” Ms. Acarli said. That’s how women like Hatice Parlakci, 45, were able to join the team. A mother of three sons, she went to school for five years before she had to quit. She joined the team soon after it got going and sometimes wears the scarves she has worked on. “The work for ZemZem had a very positive effect in my life. I can produce something and be part of a ladies’ team,” she said, “but I don’t have to leave the house for it.” Ms. Acarli takes care not to disrupt the women’s family routine. “I always tell the women, ‘Please, if you have the feeling that your husbands need more attention, tell me, and we can work it out, so you can take a break from work,”’ she said, recalling situations where she had to explain to clients that their scarves would take longer to produce, because the women in Turkey had other duties or because it was Ramadan and the women were fasting. “It has never been an issue with the customers,” she noted, “and even if it would have been, I am on the women’s side.”",

    "source": "Minutes Reflect Fed’s Worries About Persistent Declines <eos> A major economic weakening in the United States and across the world helped prod the Federal Reserve to pump more than $1 trillion into the economy last month, according to minutes of a recent Fed meeting released on Wednesday. At their latest meeting, members of the central bank’s Open Market Committee worried about persistent declines in the economy and talked about the best way to loosen credit markets. The minutes of the March 17-18 meeting offered a glimpse of how the Fed decided to inject more liquidity into the economy by buying $750 billion in mortgage-backed securities and $300 billion of longer-term Treasuries. Members said buying Treasury notes would ease lending conditions across long-term credit markets. But they also noted that buying mortgage-backed securities could have a more direct effect on home loan rates. Some members were concerned that buying Treasuries “might be seen as an indication that the Federal Reserve was responding to a fiscal objective rather than its statutory mandate, thus reducing the Federal Reserve’s credibility regarding long-run price stability.” But the committee voted unanimously to buy the securities. “In light of the economic and financial conditions, meeting participants viewed the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that might be associated with these and other programs as appropriate in order to foster the dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability,” the Fed minutes said . It was a significant move. Stocks soared, and government bond prices spiked, causing yields on the benchmark 10-year note to fall from 3 percent to about 2.5 percent as investors welcomed a big new buyer to the government bond market. The price of gold rose, and the value of the dollar dropped against other currencies, a reflection of concern that the Fed’s actions could set the stage for a weaker dollar and sharp inflation once the economy begins to recover. But the minutes suggest that inflation, a major concern last year, has become a distant worry as policy makers try to prop up the economy. “All participants agreed that inflation pressures were likely to remain subdued,” the minutes said. The Fed also signaled that it would keep target interest rates low for a while. The Fed has cut its economic views, saying that real gross domestic product would flatten for the rest of the year before beginning to expand slowly in 2010. It also said the unemployment rate, which is 8.5 percent, would rise more sharply into 2010 before leveling off “at a high level.” The minutes suggested that policy makers were growing concerned about signals from the housing sector and credit and labor markets as stark economic figures piled up this year. Committee members worried that a spiral could begin if “reduced employment and production weighed on consumer spending and investment, and as the weakening economy bolstered the prospective losses of financial institutions, leading to a further tightening of credit conditions.” Also on Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that wholesalers cut their inventories by 1.5 percent in February, the sharpest monthly decrease in 17 years. Wholesale trade grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent in February from January, but was 14 percent lower than last year.",

    "source": "32 Arrests at Rally for Airport Workers Near La Guardia <eos> The police arrested 32 people outside La Guardia Airport on Monday afternoon at a march in support of airport contract workers having a paid holiday on Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday. Some local politicians were arrested at the protest, including Representative Charles B. Rangel. They were given summonses for obstructing vehicular traffic and disobeying a lawful order, the police said. The protesters were blocking traffic at 94th Street and Ditmars Boulevard in Queens around 12:30 p.m., the police said. They held banners that read: “MLK: Our Day.” The march, organized by the union SEIU 32BJ, which represents building services employees, is part of a campaign for better wages and benefits for airport contract workers. City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and the city’s public advocate, Letitia James, attended the rally but were not arrested. About 15,000 people work for contractors hired by airlines and terminal operators at New York-area airports, the union said. Some of the workers, who provide cabin cleaning, terminal security and baggage handling, make about $8 an hour. Several City Council members were arrested at the protest. Councilman Ritchie Torres of the Bronx posted a photo of his arrest on Twitter. “Proudly celebrating MLK’s legacy by getting arrested for the first time ever in solidarity with airport workers!” he wrote. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has said that it supports making the day a paid holiday for airport workers and that it was having “productive discussions” with the union about the issue.",

    "source": "Davydenko Leads Russian March to the Semis <eos> Nikolay Davydenko is the only man who has yet to drop a set at the United States Open this year. He seems undistracted by an investigation into irregular gambling patterns in one of his matches earlier this summer, and he certainly did not seem ruffled by a tired and combustible Tommy Haas. Davydenko defeated Haas, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, and became the third Russian in three matches yesterday to advance to the semifinals in straight sets. The other two were Anna Chakvetadze and the 2004 women’s champion, Svetlana Kuznetsova. Davydenko remained quick-footed and tight-lipped throughout the match as Haas, of Germany, grew desperate trying to find a weak spot in Davydenko’s court coverage. “At times he makes you try to do too much,” Haas said. “He got to me a little mentally. Every time I tried to do something differently to fight my way out of it, he came up with an answer.” Davydenko, who lost to Roger Federer in the semifinals of last year’s tournament, addressed several questions about the gambling investigation, which is reportedly focusing on the unusual amount of money wagered on his lower-ranked opponent at the Polish Open last month. Davydenko eventually dropped out of the match because of injury. “For me, it’s very important that I just think about my games in the U.S. Open,” Davydenko said, although he speculated that outsiders might have gathered information about his injury. The other Russians winning yesterday, Chakvetadze and Kuznetsova, will face each other in the semifinals, ensuring that at least one Russian will play in the women’s final this weekend. Kuznetsova, the fourth seed, has not won a Grand Slam event since her 2004 title, and was the runner-up to Justine Henin at the 2006 French Open. She said that momentum was on her side at Flushing Meadows. “It’s my favorite tournament,” said Kuznetsova, who has worn a Yankees cap in recent weeks. “I just give all my energy. It doesn’t matter how I feel, I just come to this court and want to give my best.” Chakvetadze beat the crowd favorite Shahar Peer of Israel, 6-4, 6-1, and Kuznetsova defeated the 18-year-old Hungarian newcomer Agnes Szavay, 6-1, 6-4. The seats in Arthur Ashe Stadium had hardly cooled from the men’s action the night before, which ended with Rafael Nadal’s loss to David Ferrer at 1:51 a.m. And they hardly had a chance to warm again yesterday, as Chakvetadze and Kuznetsova made quick work of their opponents. Kuznetsova needed just 1 hour 7 minutes to dispatch Szavay. Kuznetsova’s forehand was overpowering, but Szavay said she might have given it too much respect. “I played too much to her,” Szavay said. Peer had vocal backing from the crowd at center court. Afterward, she said she would return to Israel to perform her compulsory military service, which she said made tennis look easy. Davydenko now goes on to play Federer, who beat Andy Roddick last night, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (4), 6-2. For all his confidence on the court yesterday, Davydenko was diffident about his prospects. “I feel like a top-10 player,” he said. “I play very well, but I’m not thinking I feel like I’ve reached No. 1.”",

    "source": "Taking Summer School to Get Ahead, Not Catch Up <eos> GILL, Mass. — Chase Pellegrini de Paur didn’t flunk math, and he is not trying to hone his study skills. The 15-year-old honor-roll student nevertheless spent six weeks this summer studying geometry at the prestigious Northfield Mount Hermon boarding school here. The goal was either to get credit for the class, which would let him skip ahead to higher-level courses earlier in his high school career, particularly Advanced Placement ones, or to take the course again in the fall and, already familiar with the underlying theorems, be all but guaranteed a top grade. “It’s a win-win,” said Chase, a rising sophomore at New Canaan High School in Connecticut. As the competition to get into the most selective colleges intensifies, high-achieving students are attending academic summer schools to turbocharge grade-point averages or load up on the A.P. courses seen as gateways to top-tier schools. The practice even has its own lexicon: Students who are planning to repeat a class at their regular high schools are “previewing”; those who are using summer classes to skip ahead and qualify for higher-level subjects are seeking “forward credit.” Critics, however, say the summer classes only add to the inequities of the college admissions process, in which wealthy families can afford to hire expensive SAT tutors and consultants who help develop the perfect college essay, while poorer students must fend for themselves. Image A student works on a paper during Northfield Mount Hermon’s summer session. With increasing competition to get into top colleges, students are using summer breaks to get ahead. Credit Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times Kimberly Quick, a policy associate for the Century Foundation , a think tank based in New York City said students who could not afford to spend their summers taking extra classes were being left further behind in what she called “the college access game.” “Lower-income students are much more likely to have to work in the summer, often full time, or take care of other family members,” Ms. Quick said. Those students, she noted, are the ones who might benefit the most from the advantages, like strong career networks and higher graduation rates, that top colleges can impart. Higher-income students often already have greater options. There are no hard statistics available on how many students are taking these classes, but education advisers say the numbers are on the rise, particularly in New York City and its suburbs, as well as places where college admissions can seem like a competitive sport, including Raleigh, N.C., and Silicon Valley. Many of the classes are offered at private schools, and they report a growing number of attendees. At the Hun School of Princeton, N.J., a 102-year-old boarding school, 187 students enrolled in its five-week summer school, up about 16 percent from 161 in 2014. Ten years ago, the nearby Lawrenceville School did not offer for-credit summer classes. Instead, it hosted mostly sports and recreation-related programs from outside organizations. This year, more than 40 students enrolled in the school’s accelerated math courses, as part of a rigorous, four-hour-a-day program that covers a full year’s curriculum in six weeks. It is one of several academic programs offered at the school during the summer. Image Greg Leeds, who runs Northfield Mount Hermon’s summer session, said the classes gave students something tangible: either credit or a better shot at an A if they take the class again during the school year. Credit Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times At the Horace Mann School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, 154 students enrolled in the academic summer session. Forty-four of them were in a six-week physics class that covered a year’s worth of material at a rapid clip, one of several for-credit science and math classes offered at the school’s summer session. “It’s so popular, we run it as a lottery,” said Caroline Bartels, the summer school director at Horace Mann. Some high schoolers take classes through online programs like Indiana University High School , Stanford Online High School or the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth . The online classes often cost less and allow for more flexibility than those that are in person. The Mountain View Los Altos High School District in California runs a summer school for students who need to catch up or bolster their skills, but the district directs high school students who want to accelerate their studies to two local community colleges. And high schoolers in North Carolina are encouraged to take accelerated, for-credit classes through a statewide virtual school . The demand is driven, at least in part, by students’ belief that they need to accumulate Advanced Placement classes to impress top colleges. According to the College Board , which oversees the A.P. program and designs the exams, more than 90 percent of the about 2.5 million test takers in 2015 sat for three or fewer of the exams. But the percentage of students who took 10 exams, while very small, more than doubled over the decade between 2005 and 2015, to 0.7 percent, or 16,580 students over a four-year administration range. Brian Taylor, the director of Ivy Coach , a college advising firm on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, said the belief was that college admission boards rewarded quantity when it came to A.P. exams. “When you have a kid who has taken 10 A.P.s and a kid who has taken three, all things equal, they’re going to take the kid with 10,” he said. Image The campus of Northfield Mount Hermon. The school’s summer session enrolled 286 students this year, including 113 in the college-prep program. Credit Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times But Trevor Packer, a senior vice president at the College Board, said it did not support “a race towards more, more and more.” “We want there to be balance,” Mr. Packer said. He added that the College Board had worked hard to increase the number of students — particularly low-income ones — taking A.P. classes, but a recent report by the federal Government Accountability Office found a significant gap in participation across racial and economic lines. At schools that were high poverty and where 90 percent or more of students were black or Hispanic, only 12 percent took one or more A.P. classes. At wealthy schools that were predominantly white and Asian, 24 percent did. Jill Tipograph , a summer educational consultant and career coach from Manhattan, said summer academics could “help maximize the student’s profile” and be part of the “pre-college plan.” The programs are rigorous, with long days and hours of homework. And they can be lucrative for schools: Northfield Mount Hermon’s program costs $8,200 for summer boarders. The Horace Mann summer physics class costs $4,175. The schools offer scholarships for some students. Greg Leeds, who runs Northfield Mount Hermon’s summer session, which enrolled 286 students this year — 113 in the college prep program — said these programs gave parents “more bang for their buck” than enrichment classes that were not directly related to work being done during the school year, because students got something tangible in the end: credit or a shot at an A grade in the fall in a class they had previewed. That was the case for Sarah Harte Taylor, 17, who previewed an Algebra 2 class last year at Wolfeboro: The Summer Boarding School — a summer-only school in eastern New Hampshire. Her mother, Lisa Harte, from Midtown Manhattan, said that when Sarah returned to her high school, she aced the class. Image Hunter Walker, 17, studied American history at Northfield Mount Hermon this summer in hopes of being able to skip the class this fall and take Advanced Placement computer science instead. “It was a very efficient way of doing things, very constructive,” he said. Credit Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times Hunter Walker, 17, from the Upper West Side, who was studying American history at Northfield Mount Hermon, agreed that the programs could help improve a high school transcript. He was looking for credit so that he could skip the class in the fall and take A.P. computer science instead. Hunter, a rising senior at the boarding school, said the class was intense and sometimes stressful. “But it’s worth it,” he said. “It was a very efficient way of doing things, very constructive.” Not everyone thinks it is good for the students. Psychologists like Madeline Levine, who has written extensively about the demands of adolescence, said focusing students too intensely on academic pursuits came at a cost. “Growing up has a whole bunch of developmental tasks, only one of which is getting into your first-choice school,” she said. Even some of the educators offering the classes have their doubts. At Lawrenceville, administrators have debated the merits of its accelerated math program. This is largely because some faculty members, like Hardy Gieske, a math teacher who serves as director of students for summer school, think that many students should avoid accelerating the learning process when it comes to math. “They have to soak in it for a long enough time for it to take root,” he said. Still, the school keeps the program open because there is a demand and it “helps the bottom line,” Mr. Gieske said. And at Horace Mann, Ms. Bartels said she believed many students were better off getting a break from school. She said she told many of them: “If there is anything else you can do this summer, do it.”",

    "source": "Alcoa Plans to Close Plants and Trim Work Force <eos> Alcoa , one of the world’s largest aluminum makers, described plans on Tuesday to close plants and slash its work force in an effort to contend with the continued economic downturn. The 120-year-old company, which announced several cost-cutting moves last fall, said it now planned to reduce output by 18 percent this year. It also plans to cut its head count by 13,500 employees, or 13 percent, and expects to eliminate another 1,700 contractor positions. Like many other material producers, Alcoa has struggled to cope with the steep decline in demand for fabricated goods during this economic malaise. Aluminum prices, which rose sharply last summer, have since collapsed as aluminum consumption in crucial areas like automotive and consumer sectors has dropped sharply. Calling the moves “aggressive, but prudent,” Klaus Kleinfeld, the president and chief executive of Alcoa, said the moves were necessary for the firm to try to conserve cash and reduce costs. “These are extraordinary times, requiring speed and decisiveness to address the current economic downturn, and flexibility and foresight to be prepared for future uncertainties in our markets,” Mr. Kleinfeld said. Alcoa said it also planned to sell several unprofitable business lines and was stopping all “noncritical” capital investment programs to try to conserve cash. It is freezing all hiring and salaries through 2009, the firm said. While the company said its cost-cutting programs could save it about $450 million a year before taxes, total charges for the fourth quarter of last year are likely to be $900 million to $950 million, or $1.13 to $1.19 a share. Some Wall Street analysts, however, questioned whether the moves would be enough. “I would have liked to see a little bit bigger cut in smelter output and a little bit bigger cut in capital spending, and I’m not sure they can sell the assets they want to sell,” said Charles Bradford, an analyst with Bradford Research. “People just don’t have a lot of money to buy those assets these days. I’m not so sure how much of this is going to get done.” After ending the day up 26 cents at $12.12, Alcoa’s stock was trading down 42 cents, at $11.70, in after-hours trading. Many of the world’s largest aluminum makers — including the Aluminum Corporation of China — have announced plans to reduce capacity. The hope is that if output is sharply reduced, the price of aluminum will rise above current levels. But many Wall Street analysts say despite the fact that falling energy and freight prices are helping aluminum makers, it is tough for Alcoa and its competitors to make money with aluminum prices at such low levels. It has been a challenging time for Mr. Kleinfeld, who took over the reins of Alcoa last spring from its longtime chief executive, Alain J. P. Belda. Before joining Alcoa as its president, Mr. Kleinfeld headed up the electronics and industrial conglomerate Siemens. In a conference call with analysts last October, Mr. Kleinfeld estimated at that time that one-third of the world’s aluminum capacity was “under water.” As prices continued to fall and inventories rose, analysts at Credit Suisse in December estimated that one-half of the aluminum industry was “losing money at current prices.”",

    "source": "Houston, We Have an Opportunity (to Attract More Tourists) <eos> A campaign to attract visitors to Houston has undergone a makeover, shifting from celebrities to people who are celebrated locally for achievement in the arts and cuisine. The campaign, which got under way in February, comes on the heels of a campaign with the theme “My Houston,” which has run for the last five years. The “My Houston” campaign features famous sons and daughters of the city, among them George Foreman, Beyoncé Knowles, Carl Lewis, Lyle Lovett, Jim Parsons, the rock bank ZZ Top and Chandra Wilson. The new campaign, which carries the theme “Houston is ...,” presents groups of chefs, restaurateurs, artists, singers, dancers, museum curators, musicians, actors and designers. Each group appears in print and online ads with these headlines: “Houston is tasty,” “Houston is hip” and “Houston is inspired.” The new effort, like its predecessor, is being created internally at the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau. And also like its predecessor, the new campaign is meant to sell the merits of visiting Houston to individual travelers as well as to planners of conventions and conferences. The budget for the “Houston is ...” campaign, which is to continue through May, is estimated at $440,000. The campaign is also being promoted in social media like Facebook and Twitter . The new tack was prompted by the results of a research study, says Holly Clapham, vice president for marketing at the bureau, which is undertaken each year to help determine the effectiveness of the bureau’s initiatives. The study, conducted by the research organization TNS, found that people visit Houston for two primary reasons: its culinary offerings and its arts and culture scene. Leisure visitors are primarily women, Ms. Clapham says, and the bureau has created a profile of a prototypical visitor, Lisa, who is 46 years old and has an average annual household income of $86,000 to $120,000. “She’s very active,” Ms. Clapham says of Lisa, and “likes ‘girlfriend getaways.’ ” And she will “pay more for quality,” Ms. Clapham says, but also “likes to see value” in what she buys. With all that in mind, the bureau decided that the next iteration of its image campaign — or, as Ms. Clapham puts it, “ ‘My Houston’ 2.0” — ought to celebrate the Houstonians who are the driving forces behind the restaurants, museums, galleries and other attractions that Lisa comes to visit rather than the stars who call, or once called, Houston home. “It’s not about who everyone knows,” Ms. Clapham says. “It’s about who’s working to move Houston forward.” Image An ad from the new Houston campaign. And using the actual Houstonians who run or perform at the attractions provides the campaign with “that realness factor” that is so important to potential visitors, she adds. “We had a lot of contenders” for the ads, Ms. Clapham says, and worked with organizations like the Houston Arts Alliance and the Houston Museum District Association to select people who would “represent the ethnic diversity of the city” as well as promote its more interesting attractions. There are five ads in the campaign: two with the headline “Houston is tasty,” two with the headline “Houston is inspired” and one with the headline “Houston is hip.” The “tasty” ads feature 15 chefs — eight in one ad, seven in the other — and urge would-be visitors to “sample cutting-edge menus inspired by our city’s ethnic flavors” and “experience the fresh ideas and local pride that unite our culinary community.” The “tasty” ads, which replace the “y” at the end of “tasty” with a fork, were photographed at a bar named Mongoose Versus Cobra and at Eleanor Tinsley Park in downtown Houston. The people whose endeavors are deemed “tasty” include Irma Galvan of Irma’s, Greg Gatlin of Gatlin’s BBQ, Rebecca Masson of the Fluff Bake Bar, Paul Petronella of Paulie’s, Monica Pope of Sparrow Bar and Cookshop and Seth Siegel-Gardner of the Pass and Provisions. Both “tasty” ads refer readers to a section of the bureau’s Web site, visithouston.com/tasty , where there is information about the chefs and where they cook. The “inspired” ads also present 15 people — eight in one ad, seven in the other — and ask potential visitors to “experience a city where the arts take center stage” and “explore vibrant museums and galleries in a city where creativity has no limits.” The ads were photographed onstage at the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts and outside a museum named the Menil Collection. Both “inspired” ads refer readers to another section of the bureau’s Web site, visithouston.com/inspired , where they can learn more about the people pictured in the ads, among them Tamarie Cooper, associate director of the Catastrophic Theater; Barbara Davis of the Barbara Davis Gallery; Frank Huang, concertmaster at the Houston Symphony; Nao Kusuzaki, a soloist with the Houston Ballet; Rick Lowe, founder of the Project Row Houses; and Joel Orr, a puppeteer at the Bobbindoctrin Puppet Theater. Finally, the “hip” ad features nine Houstonians and declares, “Discover why anything is possible in a city where culture and style collide.” The ad, photographed at the Last Concert Café, provides an eclectic mix of “trendsetters,” including Bun B, a rapper; Connor Barwin, a linebacker with the Houston Texans football team; Chloe Dao, a fashion designer and boutique owner; Tally Hall, a goalkeeper for the Houston Dynamo soccer team; Asli Omar, a singer; and Mickey Rosmarin, founder of a boutique, Tootsies. This ad, too, refers readers to a section of the bureau’s Web site, visithoustontexas.com/hip, to find out more about those featured in the ad. The ads are running nationally in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and regionally in five magazines: Bloomberg Businessweek, Cooking Light, Forbes, Fortune and Texas Monthly. *** If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.

    "source": "Kevin O’Connell, Third-String Quarterback, Aids Jets on Sideline <eos> FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez cannot throw a touchdown pass or an interception, visit a nightclub, pose for a magazine or even snack on a hot dog without seeming to stir the passion of New Yorkers. But there is a quiet, unassuming and behind-the-scenes presence supporting Sanchez almost every step of the way from an on-field perspective: Kevin O’Connell, the Jets’ third-string quarterback. Even a die-hard Jets fan could be forgiven for not knowing about O’Connell . He has not dressed for a game this season, and his daily responsibility includes serving as the scout-team quarterback, helping to prepare the defense to face the likes of Rex Grossman and the Washington Redskins, who host the Jets on Sunday. O’Connell, however, is much more than a bit player. Coaches and players describe him as a quasi coach, sticking close to Sanchez during games and consulting with Coach Rex Ryan ’s assistants. O’Connell has an uncanny knack for reading a game, recognizing defensive coverages and contributing insights like helping to explain how cornerbacks defended receivers. “He’s a coach with a lot of football talent,” said the rookie quarterback Greg McElroy, who is on injured reserve. “That’s really what it is. He has a great mind for it, a great eye for it. He has a tremendous feel on game days. He can see the entire field from the sideline. He can see the game vertically, as if watching film, from the sidelines.” O’Connell has played in only two regular-season games, both with the New England Patriots in 2008, when he served as the backup to Matt Cassel during the year Tom Brady sustained a season-ending knee injury in the first game. O’Connell’s N.F.L. statistics are limited to a minuscule sample size: 4 for 6, 23 yards passing. He has not thrown a touchdown pass or an interception. He was sacked once. He has a 73.6 passer rating. And that is pretty much it. But O’Connell’s contribution this season manifests itself in Sanchez’s production, even if it does not affect his own numbers. “We’re talking constantly about what you’re seeing,” Sanchez said of O’Connell. “ ‘Talk to me about this.’ ‘How did you know that?’ He’s been in three, four different offenses, and he understands not just necessarily what we’re trying to do, but football in general.” O’Connell arrived in the N.F.L. after an accomplished career at San Diego State, where he was a four-year captain. As a senior, he threw for 3,063 yards and 15 touchdowns, completing 58.5 percent of his passes. He also rushed for 408 yards and 11 touchdowns. In 2008, the Patriots drafted the 6-foot-5 O’Connell in the third round. His career in New England was limited: the Patriots surprisingly released him a year later while trimming their preseason roster. O’Connell had been a candidate to back up Brady. O’Connell, 26, spent the past two years with the Jets, though he was placed on injured reserve last season after tearing the labrum in his throwing shoulder during a preseason game. The Jets released him July 29, and the Miami Dolphins signed him Aug. 5. The Dolphins released him Sept. 3, and the Jets reacquired him Sept. 4. “He’s a young guy,” said Matt Cavanaugh, the Jets’ quarterbacks coach. “He hasn’t had a chance to go on the field, make some mistakes and learn from them and keep playing.” But O’Connell seems to have found a niche with the Jets. That he has spent some time around the league, and made stops in New England and Miami, is a benefit to the Jets’ defensive preparation. He points out how the defense might attack protection schemes. But O’Connell may be most valuable for what he brings as a sort of consultant for the Jets’ offense. The offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer said that he and the Jets’ players referred to O’Connell as “Coach O’Connell.” “He’s great on game day,” Schottenheimer said. “He has a clipboard. He’s charting coverages and things like that. He really gets the game. He really gets the game and I think, obviously, when he’s done playing, he’ll be a great coach.” O’Connell honed his football intelligence through intensive film study. In college, he kept a journal that logged each game, recording plays that confused him, coverages that tested him and his handling of situations. This season, O’Connell estimated, he has already compiled four notebooks’ worth of information from studying game film. Like the other quarterbacks, he is at the Jets’ facility every day, and for 12 hours on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. During the week, the other quarterbacks aid Sanchez. McElroy charts the game film. O’Connell is responsible for breaking down situational tape: third downs, red-zone situations, two-minute drills. On Sundays, even though he is not in uniform, O’Connell tries to affect the game by helping Sanchez. In other words, he functions as a coach. But the prospect of formally making such a transition is not on O’Connell’s mind, at least not at this point. “If I start thinking about that too soon, that transition might come a lot sooner than I hoped,” O’Connell said. “If I was lucky enough to have that chance, I’d work hard as hard as I could to do a lot of the same things I do now: to help Mark on Sundays.”",

    "source": "Economic Challenge Is Also a Balancing Act <eos> WASHINGTON — In a State of the Union speech that sought above all to reassure Americans fretful about job losses and deficits, one short sentence captured the seeming contradiction that has frustrated President Obama ’s yearlong effort to shape an economic message: “Let’s invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt.” That has become the defining challenge of Mr. Obama’s presidency: to balance the short-term economic and political demands to spend money and cut taxes now, to stimulate the economy, against the imperative to show a way to reduce the debt over the long term to assure prosperity for future generations. Mr. Obama called for new spending and tax cuts that mostly build on the original $787 billion stimulus package he signed nearly a year ago, and that would easily push the cost of all stimulus measures since he took office to over $1 trillion. But as even Mr. Obama acknowledged, the additional job-creating steps he proposed would not be nearly enough to erase the 10 percent unemployment rate that bedevils him. “Now if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit,” he said. “But we took office amid a crisis, and our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt.” So the president called for several steps to reduce deficits in the near term and over time. He proposed a three-year freeze on spending on part of the domestic budget, excluding Medicare and Social Security . That will contribute toward $20 billion in savings for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, Mr. Obama said. Details on the programs to be cut or killed will be in the budget he releases on Monday. Mr. Obama urged Congress to pass a pending “pay as you go” measure, to require that new tax cuts or spending increases for benefit programs like Medicare be offset with tax increases or spending cuts to avoid adding to the deficit. And on the heels of the Senate’s rejection this week of a bill to create a debt-reduction commission, Mr. Obama confirmed that he would establish one by executive order, to report recommendations to Congress by December — after the midterm elections. “This can’t be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we’ve solved a problem,” he said. But it remains unclear whether Congressional Republican leaders will participate; they argue that a commission would be a stalking horse for raising taxes. Mr. Obama’s latest stimulus proposals included a long-promised tax credit to employers for new hires and tax cuts to encourage both small businesses and corporations to invest. “I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay,” he told the assembled members of Congress. That note of urgency was surely intended as a spur. The Democrats’ effort to pass a jobs bill, which was on a fast track in December as the unemployment rate passed 10 percent, has stalled in the Senate. In the wake of the Democrats’ loss of the Massachusetts Senate seat, fiscal conservatives are reluctant to add much to deficits that have come to symbolize runaway spending to many independent voters. So while the House last month passed a jobs bill priced at $154 billion for small-business tax cuts and money for public works, Senate Democrats are considering a package about half that size. Mr. Obama also proposed to use $30 billion from the financial bailout fund to create a new lending facility, from which banks could draw money to lend to small businesses. The president outlined tax breaks to help middle-class families with their child care and tuition costs and retirement savings. He called for an unspecified amount of additional spending for public works and infrastructure projections, including high-speed rail . And without elaboration he set a goal of doubling exports over the next five years to create two million jobs. After laying out his plans for both bigger deficits and deficit reduction, Mr. Obama sought to reconcile the two. “I know that some in my own party will argue that we cannot address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting,” he said. “I agree, which is why this freeze won’t take effect until next year, when the economy is stronger. “But understand: if we don’t take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing and jeopardize our recovery — all of which could have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.”",

    "source": "Jury Awards $956 Million to Liberty Media <eos> A federal jury on Monday awarded $956 million to Liberty Media after concluding that the French entertainment group Vivendi deceived it in a decade-old deal involving the USA Networks. The jury in United States District Court in Manhattan issued the award after hearing evidence related to a stock swap involving the network. Liberty Media had accused Vivendi of deceiving it with rosy statements about its finances when executives inside the company were aware of a liquidity crisis. The verdict stemmed from a lawsuit Liberty Media brought in 2003, accusing Vivendi of waiting until its transaction with USA Networks and Liberty Media officially closed before reacting publicly to a downgrade of its debt rating and addressing concerns about liquidity. After the verdict was announced, Vivendi said in a statement that it would appeal the verdict, using “all available paths of action to overturn the verdict or reduce the damages award.” It added that it believed “strongly that it did nothing wrong and will continue to vigorously defend itself.” Liberty Media, in a statement of its own, said it planned to seek interest payments on the verdict amount. During closing arguments, Liberty Media’s lawyer, Michael Calhoon, urged jurors to “look at these internal memos, inside the company, talking about what was really going on inside the company when the company was saying to the public and to Liberty something totally different.” Referring to the stock swap in the transaction, he said: “We took the risk of the price falling. We didn’t take the risk of fraud.” Repeatedly in the trial, jurors heard about an e-mail in which Vivendi’s chief financial officer wrote: “I feel like I’m in the death seat of a car. I hope it doesn’t end in shame.” Jim Quinn, a lawyer for Vivendi, said the company had its own reasons for closing the deal and did not rely on misleading statements. “I think we proved that in spades,” he said. He added that “despite warnings, despite the red flags, Liberty Media did nothing to investigate the problems at Vivendi.” In the end, the jurors were left to decide whether Vivendi had made false statements in its contract with Liberty. The jury found it had and assessed damages. Mr. Calhoon had told jurors Vivendi should “pay for their fraud.” “They shouldn’t get some kind of blizzard of confusion discount,” he said.",

    "source": "Beverly Hills Is Fined for Using Too Much Water in Drought <eos> BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — This famously wealthy city was founded by businessmen who were seeking oil but found something more precious — water — and decided to stay. Now, Beverly Hills has become one of the first places in California to be slapped with fines for using too much water during the state’s devastating drought. On Friday, California water officials announced that they had issued their first fines in history for failing to meet state-mandated conservation orders, assessing penalties to this city and three other water districts. Over all, Californians cut water use by 26.1 percent in September compared with September 2013, the fourth consecutive month they have surpassed the governor’s goal of a 25 percent reduction. But some districts had not done nearly enough to cut back , officials said Friday. Along with Beverly Hills, the Indio Water Authority, the Coachella Valley Water District and the City of Redlands were fined $61,000 — or $500 a day since the start of June, when the restrictions went into effect. All of them have missed their state-mandated conservation targets — which range up to 36 percent compared with 2013 — by more than 8 percentage points since June 1. Cris Carrigan, director of enforcement for the State Water Resources Control Board , said the four districts had either taken action too late to make a difference in their water use or had not stressed the need to cut back enough to their customers. “We could have saved even more water if some residents, businesses and institutions in these communities had stepped up,” Mr. Carrigan said. “These penalties send a signal that there are consequences.” All four of the districts will be able to appeal the fines. If they do not get their water use down to the mandated levels, the state could issue cease-and-desist orders, which come with fines of up to $10,000 per day. Beverly Hills, the only one of the districts in an urban, coastal area, has fallen nearly 12 percentage points short of its 32 percent conservation standard. Mr. Carrigan said the district did little until October. “The city has not demonstrated improved conservation,” he said. “Per capita consumption is not decreasing.” In an email, Cheryl Friedling, a deputy city manager for Beverly Hills, outlined new measures the city was taking, including “penalty surcharges, hiring additional staff to address water violations and developing individualized conservation programs that will help us achieve reductions we need.” But Mr. Carrigan warned that these “very well might not be the last of the fines.” The districts that were fined this week are hardly the only ones that have failed to meet their conservation standards. More than 50 suppliers were at least 5 percent short of meeting their conservation targets in September. And state officials acknowledged that meeting conservation goals could become more difficult in the winter: Most water use is traditionally during the summer, so there was more room to save in July and August. Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the state water board, expressed optimism that the state could remain above the 25 percent threshold, even if conservation sagged in the coming months. “The fact that we’re up and over is good,” Ms. Marcus said. “Would I like a bigger cushion? Yeah, definitely. But I think we’re still in the ballpark.” Also on Friday, Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency over a bark beetle infestation that has killed tens of millions of trees during the drought. He is seeking federal resources to assist with the removal of dead trees. “California is facing the worst epidemic of tree mortality in its modern history,” Mr. Brown said in a letter to Tom Vilsack, the federal agriculture secretary. “A crisis of this magnitude demands action on all fronts.”",

    "source": "McCain Signs Up a Bush Fund-Raising Organizer <eos> WASHINGTON — Senator John McCain began tapping into President Bush’s prized political donor base on Tuesday as his campaign announced that Mercer Reynolds, who helped Mr. Bush raise a record $273 million for the 2004 re-election campaign, would be the national finance co-chairman for Mr. McCain. The development was a major sign that the Republican financial establishment was coalescing around Mr. McCain, who has often been at odds with his own party, particularly conservatives. It also signaled that Mr. Bush’s political apparatus was moving into action for Mr. McCain, a onetime insurgent and competitor to Mr. Bush in 2000 who has had a difficult relationship with the president. Mr. McCain’s advisers said that Mr. Reynolds, a wealthy Cincinnati executive and a former ambassador to Switzerland, would be of enormous help in reaching out to the president’s most valued contributors — the Bush campaign called them Rangers and Pioneers — on behalf of Mr. McCain. “He knows them all, and hopefully we’ll get them on board,” said Charles Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. Advisers to both men said on Tuesday that the once-strained relationship between the president and Mr. McCain had improved and that Mr. Bush, who vouched for Mr. McCain as a “true conservative” in a television interview last weekend, would do whatever he was asked by his party’s nominee. Mr. McCain is now the presumptive nominee, although he still faces a Republican competitor, Mike Huckabee, who continues to accumulate delegates despite Mr. McCain’s daunting lead. Mr. Reynolds, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is of critical importance to the McCain campaign not simply because of his wealth but also for his layers of contacts with other wealthy donors. Under campaign finance rules in large part created by Mr. McCain himself under the McCain-Feingold bill, individual contributions are limited to $2,300 each for the nominating contests and the general election every election cycle. The result is that highly connected, prosperous people like Mr. Reynolds are of huge value to a campaign because they can call on many other highly connected, prosperous people to write checks, which is particularly vital to Republicans in a year when Democrats have far outpaced them in fund-raising. In 2004, contributors to Mr. Bush who collected $100,000 in checks, otherwise known as bundlers, were called Pioneers. Those who collected $200,000 were called Rangers, after the Texas baseball team once partly owned by Mr. Bush. Mr. McCain’s advisers said that the senator’s campaign would also be bestowing titles on its most prolific fund-raisers under an “incentive system,” with privileges for those who raised the most money. Mr. McCain’s advisers said that the candidate, despite his signature legislative efforts to restrict the money spent on political campaigns, would not accept public financing and spending limits for this year’s general campaign. But in 2007, Mr. McCain did agree to a nonaggression pact with Senator Barack Obama to accept public financing, about $85 million each for the general election, if the Democratic nominee did the same. Mr. McCain’s advisers insisted that the senator was not turning his back on a campaign finance system, which bans large “soft-money” donations to the political parties, that he helped put in place. “The senator’s always been an advocate of contributions from individual Americans,” said Wayne Berman, a major McCain fund-raiser. “It’s those contributions that are supporting his presidential campaign.” Mr. Berman was one of numerous Bush supporters who signed up to raise money for Mr. McCain early last year, when the senator was in his first incarnation as the Republican front-runner. But the campaign fell far short of its $100 million fund-raising target and by last summer had nearly collapsed in debt and recriminations. In November Mr. McCain took out a $3 million loan to keep the race alive through New Hampshire. His primary victory there on Jan. 8 opened wallets all over the country. Since then he has held 20 fund-raisers and collected more than $12 million. Other major fund-raisers for Mr. McCain include Henry R. Kravis, the financier; A. Gerald Perenchio, the former chairman and chief executive of Univision Communications, the nation’s largest Spanish-language broadcaster; and Lewis M. Eisenberg, the former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee and the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. This week and next Mr. McCain’s advisers are planning strategy meetings to set new money targets, set a fund-raising schedule and discuss how they might use Mr. Bush at fund-raising events. They are also working on hiring staff members and setting up “McCain for president” offices around the country. “We have to talk about the short term and the long term,” Mr. Black said. “Basically you’re changing from a primary campaign that runs on fumes and volunteers to a national campaign.”",

    "source": "Roger Y. Tsien, Nobel Winner for Use of Glowing Proteins, Dies at 64 <eos> Roger Y. Tsien, who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for creating a rainbow of fluorescent proteins that could light up the dance of molecules within cells, died on Aug. 24 in Eugene, Ore. He was 64. His death was announced by the University of California, San Diego , where he was a professor of chemistry and biochemistry. A university spokesman said that he did not have information about the cause, but that Dr. Tsien, who was visiting Eugene, had suffered a “medical event” while bicycling. While other scientists made the initial discoveries of a green fluorescent protein from jellyfish, Dr. Tsien (pronounced chen) was the one who transformed it into the ubiquitous tool used by biologists today. After another scientist, Douglas C. Prasher, provided a copy of the gene that encodes the fluorescent protein, Dr. Tsien set out to make a better version. “Roger, in his brilliant ingenuity, figured it should be possible to play with it,” Charles S. Zuker , a former colleague who is now at Columbia, said in an interview. “He would do the simplest, most clever experiments to get at some of the most fundamental questions in contemporary biology.” The original protein glowed green when ultraviolet or blue light was shined on it. Dr. Tsien and the other members of his laboratory mutated the gene so that the proteins glowed brighter under blue light, which made them easier for biologists to use. (Ultraviolet light damages living cells.) When biologists seek to track the comings and goings of a particular protein in a cell, they first identify the gene that produces it. They then splice the genetic instructions for the green fluorescent protein into the gene. The result is that the protein they want to track is tagged with a fluorescent snippet, a beacon easily visible under a microscope — as when a car’s headlights are turned on at night. Dr. Tsien’s laboratory then created a version that glowed blue instead of green. Other colors followed. That enabled the tracking of multiple molecules inside living cells. “It created a new universe of biology,” Dr. Zuker said. In 2008, Dr. Tsien shared the chemistry Nobel with Osamu Shimomura of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., and Boston University School of Medicine, who discovered the jellyfish protein, and Martin Chalfie , a professor of biological sciences at Columbia, the first to insert the green fluorescent protein gene into another organism. Dr. Tsien wondered why he had been honored and not Dr. Prasher, who had shared the gene with both Dr. Chalfie and Dr. Tsien. “I think it must have been an agonizing decision for the Nobel committee, and they could easily have given the prize to Doug instead of me,” Dr. Tsien told Chemistry World magazine. Dr. Prasher had by then dropped out of science and was driving a courtesy van for a Toyota dealership in Huntsville, Ala., after budget cuts cost him his job for a NASA subcontractor. But Dr. Chalfie and Dr. Tsien invited him to attend the Nobel ceremony in Stockholm and paid for his trip. In 2012, Dr. Tsien hired Dr. Prasher to work in his laboratory. Dr. Prasher left last year. Roger Yonchien Tsien was born on Feb. 1, 1952, in New York City, the third of three sons to Hsue Chu Tsien, a mechanical engineer, and Yi Ying, who was trained as a nurse. In an autobiographical essay on the Nobel Prize website, Dr. Tsien recalled that his parents bought him a chemistry set when he was in elementary school, but that he “didn’t find it very interesting because the experiments seemed so tame.” When he was 15, he worked at a summer research program at Ohio University. That turned into a project that won the top prize in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search competition. He entered Harvard at 16 and graduated with a degree in chemistry and physics in 1972. He earned a doctorate in physiology from the University of Cambridge in England in 1977. After positions as a postdoctoral researcher at Cambridge and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Tsien moved to the University of California, San Diego, in 1989. Building on research from his doctorate, he had developed a way to measure levels of calcium in cells, which was a marker for the level of activity in neurons. The markers changed shape in the presence of calcium ions and then would change color. “It’s typical of Roger,” said Stephen Adams, a scientist who worked in Dr. Tsien’s lab. “He took something that was well known in another field and applied it to neurobiology with a few chemical modifications.” Dr. Adams recalled that Dr. Tsien wanted to track other biological markers as well. Dr. Tsien and his collaborators extracted the proteins they wanted to track, attached dye molecules and injected them back into cells. It worked, but it was laborious. Dr. Tsien heard about the green fluorescent protein and found Dr. Prasher’s paper on the gene. Dr. Tsien and Dr. Chalfie independently contacted Dr. Prasher at about the same time. “He made it a much more powerful molecule for people to do their experiments with,” Dr. Chalfie said of Dr. Tsien’s work. Dr. Tsien, with Dr. Zuker, founded two companies in the 1990s. The Aurora Biosciences Corporation commercialized drug discovery tools using fluorescent markers, and Senomyx looked for ways to modulate taste receptors to reduce the amount of sugar in foods without affecting taste. Dr. Tsien is survived by his wife, Wendy; two brothers, Richard and Louis; and a stepson, Max Rink. After winning the Nobel, Dr. Tsien shifted his research again, although his work continued to be colorful. One project was a fluorescent molecule that would light up in neon green only in cancer tumors, telling surgeons exactly what to cut out and what to leave untouched. Another stains nerve cells, again to help surgeons avoid cutting them by mistake. The tumor indicators are in initial clinical trials; the nerve stain is being tested in animals. “We hope the combination of these molecules will significantly improve patient outcome,” said Dr. Quyen T. Nguyen , a professor of head and neck surgery at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, who was collaborating with Dr. Tsien.",

Registration for the program — which will allow members to use one of 6,000 bikes from 330 stations in Midtown, Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, then return it to a different station — began on Monday, weeks before the expected opening sometime next month. Officials said hundreds had registered on Monday morning, many jockeying for the blue “founding member” keys distributed to the first 5,000 to sign up. (Later members will receive darker blue keys.) Janette Sadik-Khan, the transportation commissioner, said she “wouldn’t be surprised” if the city surpassed 5,000 memberships this week, an estimate that may prove conservative: by 3 p.m. on Monday, more than 2,500 people had signed up. Annual memberships, at a pretax cost of $95, allow riders to use bikes for as long as 45 minutes without an additional charge. Ms. Sadik-Khan noted, as the city often has, that the yearly cost is less than the cost of a single 30-day unlimited-ride MetroCard. Image Bikes for the program at Old Fulton Street and Elizabeth Place in Brooklyn. Registration began Monday, with more than 2,500 people signed up by 3 p.m.; the program is to start next month. Credit Ángel Franco/The New York Times The program, which was originally scheduled to begin last summer, has seen a series of delays — first because of software problems , then because of flooding sustained by much of the system infrastructure at the Brooklyn Navy Yard during Hurricane Sandy. The initial number of stations will be more than was first expected after the flooding, Ms. Sadik-Khan said, though fewer than the 420 stations that the city had planned for its scheduled 2012 opening. The network is expected to expand to 10,000 bikes and 600 stations, including the Upper East and Upper West Sides and Long Island City, Queens. Howard Wolfson, a deputy mayor under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and an avid cyclist, said New Yorkers would care little about the delays once the program began, predicting that it would become “a huge part of this mayor’s legacy.” “Nobody’s going to say, ‘Oh, I wish it had been a year earlier’ or ‘Why wasn’t it in March?’ ” he said. “They will be happy to have it; they will be using it. It will be an enormously successful program.” After a news conference on Monday in Dumbo, Brooklyn, Ms. Sadik-Khan and Mr. Wolfson took a short ride on the bikes, taking care to stop at a traffic light with many reporters in view. The program is being operated by New York City Bicycle Share, a division of Alta Bicycle Share. Alison Cohen, the company’s president during the system’s early hiccups, is no longer with the company, officials said. Ms. Cohen did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.",

    "source": "Iran Lashes Out at West Over Protests <eos> Iran continued to arrest opposition members on Tuesday in what seemed to be an effort to curb further protests after Sunday’s defiant demonstrations against the government, according to opposition Web sites. The authorities arrested dozens of journalists, students and activists on Monday and Tuesday, the Web sites said. Among those arrested was the sister of the Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, who has been critical of the government. The crackdown appears to be the largest since June, when antigovernment protests exploded after the country’s widely disputed presidential election. Sunday’s protests were the bloodiest since the summer, and on Tuesday an opposition Web site, Jaras , said the death toll was likely to be significantly higher than previously thought. The site quoted what it said was a leaked confidential report by the official news agency IRNA, saying that 37 people had been killed. The security forces had earlier said that eight people had been killed in Tehran, and Jaras itself had earlier reported that 13 people were killed in Tehran and elsewhere. IRNA sometimes issues reports only to a limited number of subscribers, but it was impossible to immediately verify either the existence of the report or its contents. Opposition figures had said earlier that they expected the number of dead to rise because government forces had shot into crowds, and videos have surfaced on the Web in recent days that are said to show protesters being run over by cars. Ali Moussavi, a nephew of the opposition leader Mir Hussein Moussavi, was one of those run over by a vehicle, according to a family friend who said earlier this week that the assault was an assassination that took place outside the nephew’s home. Because foreign reporters were barred from the demonstration, it was impossible to confirm the breadth of the violence on Sunday. The authorities have claimed that the West has been behind the protests and that the killings were carried out by “suspicious elements.” The semiofficial Fars news agency reported Tuesday that the British ambassador, Simon Gass, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry over Britain’s “interference into Iran’s internal affairs.” The British government said its envoy would respond “robustly” to any criticism, Reuters reported. After the election in June, Iran sought to cast Britain as a major instigator of the unrest that followed. Also on Tuesday, the speaker of Parliament, Ali Larijani, who had voiced more moderate views in the past, called for the “arrest of offenders of the religion and the harshest punishment for antirevolutionary figures,” ISNA, a semiofficial news agency, reported. He refrained from naming those he wanted punished, but other government officials have called for Mr. Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi, another leader of the opposition, to be held accountable for the continuing defiance of the government. Meanwhile, some Iranians living abroad — many of whom fled the country after the Islamic Revolution — appeared to be making a more concerted effort to discredit the government. A group called United4Iran, a network of Iranians around the world who came together after the June protests, posted a postcard on its Web site titled “Wanted,” with the pictures of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the winner of the disputed election; and the leader of the Revolutionary Guards, Mohammad Ali Jafari. “The diaspora wants to play a role in bringing the violence to an end,” said Hadi Ghaemi, one the organizers for United4Iran. “We are highlighting the human rights situation in Iran and the three figures that are behind it.” United4Iran also posted a statement from Ms. Ebadi, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, saying that her sister, who had been arrested, was not a political person. Ms. Ebadi, who left Iran right before the election, said the authorities have been threatening to arrest her sister unless she handed over what they hoped would be damaging information about Ms. Ebadi. “I initially did not take this seriously,” Ms. Ebadi wrote, “but I am sad and upset to see that this was not an empty threat.”",

    "source": "No End to Questions in Cheney Hunting Accident <eos> WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 - The White House sought with little success on Monday to quell an uproar over why it took the better part of a day to disclose that Vice President Dick Cheney had accidentally wounded a fellow hunter in Texas on Saturday and why even President Bush initially got an incomplete report on the shooting. The victim, Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old lawyer, was transferred from the intensive care unit to a private room in a Corpus Christi hospital on Monday. He was listed as stable, with wounds to his face, neck, chest and rib cage from the pellets sprayed at him from 30 yards away by Mr. Cheney's shotgun. Calls to Mr. Whittington's room were routed to the hospital's marketing department, which said it was taking messages for him, but he did not return a call. Texas officials said on Monday night that Mr. Cheney would be issued a warning citation for hunting without a proper game stamp on his license. The local sheriff said an investigation had concluded that the episode was \"no more than an accident.\" At the White House, Mr. Cheney made no statement on Monday and remained out of public view. At the beginning of a meeting with Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations, Mr. Bush laughingly told Mr. Cheney that reporters would later enter the room; the vice president left before the journalists arrived. Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, was battered at his daily news briefing by journalists demanding answers to why Mr. Cheney had not been faster to make public what happened and why he had chosen a local newspaper in Texas as his vehicle for doing so. The pressure came in part from questions about whether Mr. Cheney -- who is already known for his inclination to keep his business, professional and political dealings behind closed doors -- might have been trying to play down the incident, a suggestion rejected by those who were with Mr. Cheney over the weekend. Among the people with him at the Armstrong Ranch in South Texas was his host Katharine Armstrong, a lobbyist and longtime friend of Mr. Cheney. Her lobbying clients include several that do business with the federal government, though Ms. Armstrong said she did not believe that she had ever lobbied Mr. Cheney. In an interview, Ms. Armstrong said that it did not occur to anyone in the hunting party to make news of the shooting public immediately, but that no one, including Mr. Cheney, had called for holding it back. She said Mr. Cheney participated in discussions on Sunday morning about disclosing the incident, agreeing that it should be made public but deferring to the Armstrong family on how to do so. On Sunday morning, Ms. Armstrong tipped off her local newspaper, the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, to the story. It was later picked up by national wire services and confirmed by Mr. Cheney's office. The incident provided a wealth of material for Democrats, gun control activists and critics of the Bush administration, not to mention late-night comedians. Mr. McClellan struggled at times to explain even the most basic details in the case, including when and how Mr. Bush was informed about it. In the end, White House officials said Mr. Bush learned about the shooting accident at 7:30 p.m. Eastern time, about an hour after it happened, in a call from Andrew H. Card Jr., his chief of staff. But Mr. Bush did not find out that Mr. Cheney fired the shot until about half an hour later in a subsequent call from Karl Rove, his senior adviser and deputy chief of staff, who had called Ms. Armstrong to ask about the incident. The local sheriff, Ramon Salinas III of Kenedy County, said the Secret Service called him shortly after the shooting occurred. Sheriff Salinas said he sent his chief deputy, Gilbert Sanmiguel, to the Armstrong Ranch that night. He said Mr. Sanmiguel interviewed Mr. Cheney and reported that the shooting was an accident. The sheriff said Sunday that they had yet to speak to \"the victim.\" \"But you could say it's closed,\" Mr. Salinas said of the case. On Monday, a news release from the sheriff's office said that \"Mr. Whittington's interview collaborated Vice President Cheney's statement\" and that the department was \"fully satisfied that this was no more than a hunting accident.\" There is no requirement to report nonfatal hunting accidents in Texas, said Lydia Saldana, the communications director for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. In a statement on Monday night, Mr. Cheney's office said a member of his staff had asked the Parks and Wildlife Department for all of the necessary permits for the vice president to go quail hunting in Texas and had paid $140. But, the statement said, the staff member was not informed of the need for an additional stamp, costing $7, to allow hunting of upland game birds. It said Mr. Cheney has now sent a $7 check to the department. Mr. Cheney has often gone hunting as vice president, sometimes with other prominent officials, including Justice Antonin Scalia. During the 2004 presidential campaign, Mr. Cheney mocked Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee, for having worn camouflage on a duck-hunting trip, saying Mr. Kerry's \"new camo jacket is an October disguise, an effort he's making to hide the fact that he votes against gun-owner rights at every turn.\" This past weekend brought Mr. Cheney together with a group of old friends, friends of friends and political supporters in the kind of private setting he relishes. The guests included Pamela Pitzer Willeford, a Texan who was appointed ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein in 2003. She was with Mr. Cheney at the time of the shooting, as was Ms. Armstrong, whose mother, Anne, is a prominent Republican supporter and whose family ranch is a familiar destination for Republican politicians. According to Texans for Public Justice, a watchdog organization, Ms. Armstrong first registered as a lobbyist in 2003. She registered in 2004 as a lobbyist for Parsons, an engineering and construction firm that has done extensive work in Iraq, and listed the contract size at more than $100,000, according to lobbying records from the Texas Ethics Commission provided by Texans for Public Justice. Ms. Armstrong's business partner, Karen Johnson, spent several years lobbying for Parsons, including procuring contracts with the State Department, the Department of Transportation and the United States Agency for International Development, according to PoliticalMoneyLine, which tracks federal lobbying. Ms. Johnson also lobbies for major corporations, including Lockheed Martin, and has been one of Mr. Bush's leading fund-raisers. Ms. Armstrong has a relatively limited list of lobbying clients in Texas and in Washington. Public records show that she has worked for Baker Botts, the law firm; Prionics AG, a biotechnology company; Trajen, a firm that performs aviation technical support for the United States military; and the King Ranch, the property next to her family's ranch. Records in Texas indicate that she has lobbied at the state level for three companies: Avex Group, the Dannenbaum Engineering Corporation and Ecocreto USA. Ms. Armstrong played down her role as a lobbyist and suggested that she had not brought up business during Mr. Cheney's visit. She was appointed to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission in 1999 by Mr. Bush, who was then the Texas governor. \"You need to understand that the Cheneys are our friends maybe for a couple of decades, maybe 30 years,\" Ms. Armstrong said, adding that she did not personally represent Parsons. \"I represent a couple of Texas companies, not a large lobbying practice,\" she said. Ms. Armstrong said she did more public relations and consulting work than lobbying, but she declined to disclose her clients. She said none were involved in Iraq \"that I know of.\" Asked if she was concerned that Mr. Cheney's visit could create the appearance of impropriety during the lobbying investigation involving Jack Abramoff, which has brought to light the often close personal and professional ties between lobbyists and public officials, Ms. Armstrong said: \"Oh my God, he's a friend. I don't believe I've ever lobbied the vice president, nor would I be comfortable doing so.\" Ms. Armstrong and Ms. Willeford said the accident was largely the fault of Mr. Whittington, who had reappeared alongside two of his hunting companions without giving proper warning. Mr. Cheney, who was carrying a 28-gauge shotgun, had already begun to fire and sprayed Mr. Whittington. \"He got peppered pretty good,\" Ms. Armstrong said. \"He fell with his head toward me.\" She said she ran over to Mr. Whittington, who had fallen, but stayed out of the way while Secret Service agents tended to him. \"There was some bleeding, but it wasn't horrible,\" she said. \"He was more bruised.\" Ms. Willeford, whose husband was also at the ranch, said in an interview after visiting the victim at the hospital that Mr. Whittington accepted responsibility for the accident. \"He understands that he could have handled it better,\" Ms. Willeford said. \"Harry should have let us know he was back there.\"",

    "source": "Stride Gum Campaign Satirizes Apple Publicity Machine <eos> ON Aug. 1, a billboard appeared in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan displaying only a date, “08.13.12,” and clues seemed to point to Apple. Consistent with the style of Apple advertising and packaging, the billboard was black type on a white background and its typeface was a version of Myriad , which Apple uses nearly exclusively. Also noteworthy was the billboard’s location: the intersection of Broome and Thompson streets, 450 yards from the Apple Store on Prince Street. A SoHo resident, Colin Mackenzie, wrote on Twitter on Aug. 5 that a “big billboard just got put up by my apt with ‘08.13.12’ in what looked like Apple font ... iPhone5 maybe?” On Aug. 6 on MacRumors, the popular Web site for Apple enthusiasts, “Bendrix” posted a photograph of the billboard and wrote: “What is the meaning of this? Is it Apple related?” What they were chewing over turns out, appropriately enough, to be gum. On Monday, the billboard will be replaced by a new one featuring Shaun White, the gold medalist snowboarder, holding a pack of Stride Mintacular, a new flavor that features his likeness on the package. “Stride Mintacular,” reads the copy, the type treatment again mimicking Apple’s. “Chewing redefined. Again.” An online video by Stride introducing the Mintacular flavor is shot in the same documentary style as Apple’s product debut videos. Apple introductory videos, including one for the new MacBook Pro from June that has more than 760,000 views on YouTube, feature designers seated before a white background speaking with awe and wonder about new products. Unlike the Apple videos, Stride uses actors to depict its executives. “From the moment you pick it up, you instinctively know how to use it,” says an actor in the Stride sendup, as a piece of the gum is shown. “There are no rules at all when it comes to holding it. I don’t need to change who I am to fit the product. It fits me.”  The video and billboards are by the London office of Wieden & Kennedy. The video will be featured in ads on the Web site for The Onion, the satirical publication, on the Stride Facebook page, which has three million followers, and on YouTube. “A lot of product launches treat each successive variation of their products as if they’re groundbreaking and will change people’s lives,” said Sam Heath, a creative director at Wieden & Kennedy. “They talk about them in this very grand, revelatory, almost religious way, and we thought that it would be fun to take the same approach and make a big hoo-ha over what is essentially a minor thing: a new gum flavor.” The Stride video is “a great parody and hilarious,” said David Vinjamuri, author of “Accidental Branding” and an adjunct professor of marketing at New York University. “Apple is one of those companies that’s been brilliant for so long that they probably take themselves too seriously, and have this sort of pretentious self-assurance.” But Mr. Vinjamuri said that while viral efforts like “ Tea Partay ,” a 2006 rap video in which preppies glorify Smirnoff Raw, a malt beverage, “got the brand attributes in there,” he questioned whether the new Stride video did so. “The test for branded entertainment is, ‘Does it create a strong affiliation with the brand?’ and ‘Does it reinforce the underlying brand message?’ ” he said. With the Stride video, he continued, “it’s unique humor, but I’m not sure how it relates back to the brand.” In September 2011, Stride introduced the first flavor attached to Mr. White, Whitemint , featuring his name and likeness prominently on the package. Whitemint now ranks second behind spearmint in sales among more than a dozen Stride flavors, according to Steve Siegal, the senior brand manager for Stride. The brand, which is owned by Kraft, is aimed primarily to those 18 to 24, and along with being “the most iconic figure in action sports,” Mr. White is “a personality fit for the brand because he’s genuine, authentic and exudes a lot of confidence,” Mr. Siegal said. On Aug. 21, Mr. White will appear at an event at a 7-Eleven on East 14th Street in Manhattan. The store will be stocked only with packs of Mintacular and Whitemint, and a batch of Mintacular-flavored Slurpees will be served.  Gum sales were down 2.6 percent overall and sugarless gum was down 3 percent in the year that ended July 8, according to SymphonyIRI Group, a market research firms whose data does not include Walmart. Stride revenue is down 11.6 percent from a year ago, and the brand has a 6.2 percent share of the sugarless gum category, down from a 9.1 share in August 2010. It spent $22.7 million on advertising in 2011, according to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP. From its introduction in 2006 through 2011, Stride marketed itself as “the ridiculously long-lasting gum.” Commercials from JWT, New York, part of WPP, featured misguided Stride marketers who, frustrated that they cannot sell more gum because each piece lasts so long, force consumers to spit theirs out. As the new agency for the brand, Wieden & Kennedy has replaced the slogan with “A little bit epic.” In a commercial introduced in May, a young man at a loss for how to comport himself when he sees a former girlfriend in a coffee shop pops in a piece of Stride and settles on gallantly holding the door for her as she leaves. It has 708,000 views on YouTube. In advertising parlance, the new campaign signals a shift from emphasizing a functional benefit, persistent flavor, to an emotional one, the feeling of ease and confidence from fresh breath. “Gum is not going to change your world or get you to win the Olympics,” said Mr. Heath, of Wieden & Kennedy. “But it might just give you a little nudge to be relaxed in a social situation.”",

    "source": "Purdue, Citing Research Misconduct, Punishes Scientist <eos> An appeals committee at Purdue University has upheld findings of misconduct on the part of a professor who claims to have created energy-generating fusion in a tabletop experiment, the university announced on Wednesday. With the findings, William R. Woodson, the university’s provost, has imposed punishment on the professor, Rusi P. Taleyarkhan. Dr. Taleyarkhan remains on the Purdue faculty, but his distinction as a “named professor” has been removed, along with an annual allotment of $25,000 that accompanied it. In addition, he is prohibited from serving as a thesis adviser to graduate students for at least the next three years. John Lewis, a lawyer for him, said Dr. Taleyarkhan was considering his options, among them challenging the sanctions in court. Beginning with a paper published in the journal Science in 2002, Dr. Taleyarkhan, who then worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, has claimed that the force of sound waves can collapse bubbles in a liquid violently enough to generate conditions that fuse together hydrogen atoms, releasing energy. Scientists working in other laboratories have not been able to reproduce the experiments. In July, an investigatory committee at Purdue, though coming to no conclusions about that finding itself, determined that Dr. Taleyarkhan had later falsely claimed independent confirmation of the work. Actually, the committee said, he had been involved in supervising the follow-up experiment, which was conducted by a postdoctoral researcher in his laboratory, and in writing the resulting scientific papers. The committee also found that a graduate student in his laboratory whom Dr. Taleyarkhan added as an author to those follow-up papers had made no substantial contributions. Dr. Taleyarkhan appealed the decision. The rejection of that appeal, by a three-member panel appointed by Dr. Woodson, the provost, was unanimous. Responding to a request for comment, Dr. Taleyarkhan referred in an e-mail message to the investigatory committee’s dismissal of 10 other accusations of misconduct, including improper presentation of data. “The immense three-year-long investigation,” he wrote, “has thrown out all allegations related to fraud and fabrication and therefore represents a success for the science.”",

    "source": "Dead Coral Found Near Site of Gulf Oil Spill <eos> A survey of the seafloor near BP’s blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico has turned up dead and dying coral reefs that were probably damaged by the oil spill , scientists said Friday. The coral sites lie seven miles southwest of the well, at a depth of about 4,500 feet, in an area where large plumes of dispersed oil were discovered drifting through the deep ocean last spring in the weeks after the spill. The large areas of darkened coral and other damaged marine organisms were almost certainly dying from exposure to toxic substances, scientists said. The corals were discovered on Tuesday by scientists aboard a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research vessel using a submersible robot equipped with cameras and sampling tools. The documented presence of oil plumes in the area, the proximity to BP’s well and the recent nature of the die-off make it highly likely that the spill was responsible, said Charles Fisher, a marine biologist from Pennsylvania State University who is the chief scientist on the gulf expedition, which was financed by the federal government. “I think that we have a smoking gun,” Dr. Fisher said. “The circumstantial evidence is very strong that it’s linked to the spill.” The discovery of the dead corals offers the strongest evidence so far that oil from the BP well may have harmed marine life in the deep ocean, a concern raised by many biologists soon after the April 20 blowout that caused the spill. At an estimated nearly five million barrels, it was the largest offshore oil spill in the nation’s history. A brownish substance covered many of the dead or dying reefs but was probably dead tissue and sediment, not oil, Dr. Fisher said. Oil seeps naturally from the seafloor throughout the Gulf of Mexico, but that was unlikely to have caused such a severe coral die-off, he added. “We have never seen anything like this at any of the deep coral sites that we’ve been to,” Dr. Fisher said. “And we’ve been to quite a lot of them.” Further study is needed to conclusively link the coral die-off to the spill, scientists said, and the survey team took a number of samples from the site to test for the presence of hydrocarbons and dispersant. Whether these samples will yield direct evidence leading back to the spill is unclear. “No one yet knows if the signature of whatever toxin killed these corals can be found in their skeletons after the tissue sloughs off,” Dr. Fisher said. Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, called the findings significant. “Given the toxic nature of oil and the unprecedented amount of oil spilled, it would be surprising if we did not find damage,” she said in a statement. “This is precisely why we continue to actively monitor and evaluate the impact of the spill in the gulf.” “We are determined to hold the responsible parties accountable for the damage done to the environment,” she added. The ocean floor near the site of the well is still largely unexplored and is probably home to many other deep-water coral communities that scientists are eager to study. The scientists will return to the same region on an expedition in December for more research, using a Navy vehicle that can accommodate two scientists and a pilot to depths of up to nearly 15,000 feet. Work on deep-water corals is typically conducted using advanced submersibles or remotely operated underwater vehicles. Coral sites in shallower waters farther from the well have not suffered visible damage, scientists say, but they are still studying these reefs for signs of less acute long-term effects. “There’s a lot of work to be done to see if there’s been some sublethal effect on these corals,” said Erik Cordes, a marine biologist from Temple University who has been studying reefs in the gulf in the aftermath of the spill.",

    "source": "19 Police Officers in the Bronx Are Charged With Downgrading Crimes <eos> Nineteen New York City police officers assigned to a station house in the Bronx face disciplinary action after being charged on Friday by department lawyers with wrongdoing, including incorrectly classifying crimes and downgrading criminal complaints, the police said. The administrative charges against the officers, from the 40th Precinct, follow an internal audit that uncovered 55 crime reports that were improperly processed during a four-month period last year, the police said. As a result, the complaints appeared less serious than when victims first made them, and the precinct appeared more successful at fighting crime than it actually was. In a statement accompanying the announcement of the charges, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton described them as “strict but fair.” “The purposeful misrepresentation of crime data is rare but nevertheless unacceptable, and it will be dealt with accordingly,” Mr. Bratton said. Those charged include a lieutenant, eight sergeants, nine police officers and a detective, the police said. While none have been placed on modified duty or suspended without pay, the precinct’s commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Lorenzo Johnson, has been temporarily assigned to a non-patrol services command pending further review, Stephen P. Davis, the department’s chief spokesman, said. Inspector Johnson has not been charged with wrongdoing, Mr. Davis said, but “is being held accountable because he is the commanding officer.” Auditors are now reviewing crime data for the 49th Precinct, where Inspector Johnson served until moving to the 40th Precinct in April 2014, the police said. The issue of incorrectly classified data has bedeviled the Police Department since it began to rely on the computerized tracking of crime with the system known as CompStat , which Mr. Bratton introduced when he last was the commissioner in New York, in the early 1990s. Critics have questioned the extent to which CompStat could be undermined by departmental incentives to keep crime low, as reflected in statistics. Patrick J. Lynch , president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, raised that specter again on Friday while saying the union would “vigorously defend” the accused officers. “It’s an artificial way of keeping felonies down with fewer officers on the street, a problem that we still experience today,” he said. In one high-profile 2010 episode involving allegations of data being doctored, a police commander, Deputy Inspector Steven Mauriello , and four officers faced internal charges based on another officer’s claims that crime complaints in the 81st Precinct in Brooklyn had been manipulated. Inspector Mauriello specifically was charged with failing to record a grand larceny complaint and with impeding the department’s investigation, officials said at the time. The current inquiry into the 40th Precinct crime data grew out of an anonymous tip to the Internal Affairs Bureau about a “mischaracterization of crime reporting going on,” Lawrence Byrne, the deputy commissioner of legal matters, said. In conducting the audit, the department’s Quality Assurance Division reviewed 1,558 crime complaint reports filed from May to August 2014 — the first four months of Inspector Johnson’s tenure — and examined 911 calls and so-called radio runs during that time to assess officers’ responses, the police said. Forty-four complaints prompted immediate concern, including six in which the narrative in police reports did not match the crime alleged. In fewer than 10 cases, officers simply did not record a complaint that was made. Most of the improperly classified complaints involved five low-level offenses — petit larceny, lost property, misdemeanor assault, criminal mischief and criminal trespass — that should have been recorded as more serious crimes. The police said they did not believe any of the reports at issue led to an arrest. Mr. Davis said the auditors believed they had captured the extent of the wrongdoing. “They think they wrapped it up for the audit period,” he said, adding, “It’s disturbing, the scope of this.” Once the reports were corrected, data showed that major crime in the precinct fell 11.4 percent over all in 2014, compared to 14 percent, as originally reported. The police commissioner is the department’s ultimate arbiter of punishment — from the loss of vacation days to termination — in such cases, which can drag on for years. Inspector Mauriello, for instance, remains on active duty in the department’s Transit Bureau in the Bronx and has yet to resolve the charges against him nearly five years after they were filed.",

    "source": "Texas Republican Personifies Challenge for Immigration Bill <eos> GONZALES, Tex. — The questions about immigration at Representative Blake Farenthold’s town meeting were urgent and to the point. So were the answers. Mr. Farenthold, a Republican, told an audience here on Tuesday that the overhaul of the nation’s immigration laws that recently passed the Senate “doesn’t stand a snowball’s chance in hell in the House of Representatives.” The 70 or so constituents — largely older, largely white — who filled the small, warm room in the Gonzales Municipal Building were more curious than combative, more earnest than angry. They wanted to know, for instance, why Mr. Farenthold thought that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, had supported the Senate’s immigration bill, which includes a path to citizenship for 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. “I think he wants to be president,” Mr. Farenthold said with a laugh. Mr. Farenthold embodies the challenge for advocates of major immigration changes as they press the issue in the House. Even though he represents a district with a significant population of Hispanics, he has strong reservations about providing a path to full citizenship for unauthorized immigrants, a provision that backers of the Senate measure consider a condition of their support. Mr. Farenthold instead favors what he calls “earned legalization” — a process in which immigrants would have to meet a series of conditions for remaining in the United States. Immigration advocates say that approach would create a second class of people who could never become citizens. “My deal is you start as far to the right as you can get, and go to the conference committee with the Senate, and hopefully end up with something you can live with,” Mr. Farenthold said in an interview after his event. “Getting to citizenship is going to be tough, but never say never.” Mr. Farenthold is among the House Republicans who have expressed some openness to an immigration overhaul. Elected in 2010 on the Tea Party wave, he defeated a longtime Democratic incumbent by 800 votes. His district at the time stretched from Corpus Christi down to Brownsville, on the border with Mexico, with Hispanics making up more than 70 percent of the population. After a politically favorable redrawing of his district after the 2010 census, Mr. Farenthold now holds what is considered a safe Republican seat, with a decreased, but still significant, share of Hispanics — 49.5 percent, according to the census. For many other House Republicans, however, the redistricting changes were starker, creating little political incentive to support an immigration overhaul. Only 24 Republicans sit in districts that are more than 25 percent Latino, and last year Mitt Romney won 17 of those districts by more than 10 points. That leaves, said David Wasserman, the House editor for The Cook Political Report, only a handful of districts that are “substantially Latino and remotely competitive.” Redistricting, Mr. Wasserman added, “makes the Republican majority in the House almost impenetrable,” but it also makes the job of Speaker John A. Boehner “almost unmanageable.” Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, described the Republican predicament similarly. “Redistricting puts them in a very difficult position when they’re contemplating voting for immigration reform,” he said. “They know in their hearts it’s the right thing to do, but their political brain is blaring warning signals that they’re exposing themselves to a primary from the Tea Party and extreme right-wing base.” In person, Mr. Farenthold can come off as slightly goofy. He is fleshy, with a gap between his top front teeth, and he kicked off his hourlong question-and-answer session by joking, “We can now play stump the congressman with questions.” After the event, he turned to his district director and said good-naturedly: “You never got me a Dr Pepper, Bob. That’s a hashtag fail.” Moments later, the soda appeared. He also threw out bits of red meat intended to appeal to his conservative base. On guns: “I’m a Texan — my idea of gun control is hitting what you aim at and nothing else,” he said. And on potential budget cuts: “I think there are several departments we could completely get rid of, and we wouldn’t miss it,” he said, as the crowd murmured its assent. But his tone turned more moderate when he talked about immigration changes, a reflection of the cross forces in his redrawn district: a voting base that disapproves of anything that smacks of amnesty, but also a population that is about half Hispanic, and a business community that believes that undocumented workers are critical to the economy. The consistent message that he hears from constituents, he said, is “no to the Senate bill and no amnesty.” He added, almost wearily, “Where the lines of amnesty are have not been sorted out in the American psyche.” Mr. Farenthold told the crowd that he favored the piecemeal approach being taken by the House Judiciary Committee, on which he sits, “where you’re able to say yes or no on whatever issue, rather than having to vote up or down on a big comprehensive bill.” Later, in the interview, he said that some of those pieces could include a path to legalization for the “innocent victims” brought to the country illegally as young children, he said, or “for folks who served honorably in the military.” Referring to the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country, he added: “It could be a pathway to legalization. It could be way back in the line, after everyone else.” If nothing else, Mr. Farenthold hopes to use his background as a talk radio host to help his fellow Republicans “talk to constituents in a way that isn’t offensive, and that shows compassion and that is reasonable.” He recalled recently doing a radio interview with another Republican legislator, who three times referred to immigrants as “those people.” “I’ve been in radio since I was 15 years old — you might as well have used a racial slur,” he said. “ ‘Those people’ is a bad word.” Some pro-immigration groups are taking Mr. Farenthold at his word. Jeremy Robbins, the director of the Partnership for a New American Economy, said that Mr. Farenthold was on his organization’s list of lawmakers it was hoping to persuade to vote for an immigration compromise. “He’s from Texas, he’s on Judiciary, and he’s thought about immigration,” Mr. Robbins said. And Fernando Garcia, the executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights, which recently helped organize an immigration overhaul tour throughout the state, said he believed that Mr. Farenthold was “on the fence.” “If Farenthold doesn’t see the future of his district, and if he doesn’t see the future of the party as a whole, then he is betting on the wrong side,” Mr. Garcia said. “He needs to make a decision within the next few months, because votes are going to happen soon.”",

    "source": "In Westchester, Many Seem Able to Wait Out the Storm <eos> THE real estate troubles that have been plaguing the rest of the nation are now hitting hard in Westchester, with markedly fewer sales, according to a report released last month by the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. In Westchester, there was a 31 percent drop in the number of sales during the first quarter of this year, to 1,340 from 1,927 during the same period last year. That is the largest year-over-year decrease since the listing service began keeping records in 1980. Still, the median price of a single-family house in Westchester remained fairly steady — down 2 percent, to $622,500, for the first quarter of this year, compared with $635,000 a year ago. The comparisons with the first quarter of last year were in contrast with the national trend. In the first quarter of this year, the median price of existing single-family homes nationwide was down 7.7 percent from the first quarter of 2007, the National Association of Realtors reported. The relative stability of prices in Westchester may be linked to a decrease in inventory, which, at 5,903 houses on March 31, was 14 percent below 2007’s first-quarter level, the Multiple Listing Service said. The reason, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and writer of the report, is that unlike many areas, Westchester has “an above-average number of homeowners with considerable control over whether and when to list their properties for sale.” Many homeowners — among them, empty nesters — appear able to wait out the downturn, he said. Also, foreclosure on homes has not resulted in a flood of new inventory, even though the foreclosure rate in the county has more than doubled in the past year. But the report cautions that the foreclosure problem has not played itself out and could spread. There were 759 foreclosure filings in Westchester in the first quarter of 2008, compared with 530 for the first quarter of 2007, 378 during the first quarter of 2006 and 244 for the same period in 2005, according to the county clerk’s office. But not all filings result in foreclosure actions. Some prospective foreclosures are resolved through refinancing or other means, like short sales — when an owner and lender agree to sell a house for a reduced price to satisfy the mortgage. In other cases, investors buy properties before they reach the open market. Much of the foreclosure activity has been focused in less-affluent areas of the county in cities including Mount Vernon, Yonkers and New Rochelle. By comparison, the high end of the market appears to be holding its own, said Harding Mason, president of the County Board of Realtors and an associate broker in Houlihan Lawrence’s Katonah office. The average price of a single-family house (as opposed to the median, which represents the middle of the price spectrum) rose about 4 percent, to $935,556, in the first quarter, an indication that some high-priced transactions were in the mix, he said. Houses selling for $1 million or more accounted for 31 percent of first-quarter sales compared with 21 percent in 2007. Other sectors of the housing market also experienced downturns. Sales of condominiums were down by almost 35 percent, to 209 from 319 in the first quarter last year. The first-quarter median sale price for condos was $380,000, or 3 percent below last year’s level. Sales of co-ops declined 18.9 percent, to 343, from 423 in the previous year’s first quarter. The price of co-ops also declined, with a drop of about 5 percent for the median since last year, to $176,000 from $185,000. Mr. Mason said that despite the numbers, he was optimistic about the housing market, noting that it seemed stronger in April. “Some buyers,” he said, “will see this as a good opportunity to make an investment.” At Ginsburg Development Companies in Valhalla, Michael J. Bartolone, the chief operating officer, said the start of three new construction projects in Westchester — in Hastings-on-Hudson, Ossining and Peekskill — had been delayed because of the slow market. But at two of the company’s communities already under construction — Christie Place, a luxury condominium project in Scarsdale for people 55 and over, and Riverwatch, a conversion of an apartment complex to condos — sales, which had been slow in 2007, started to pick up in recent months, Mr. Bartolone said. Rather than cutting prices, the company is offering buyer incentives. For example, if a buyer opts for $25,000 in extras, it will match that by providing another $25,000 in extras at no additional cost. In Bedford, Douglas Smolev, one of a group of developers building 17 homes priced at $4.25 million and up at Stone Manors on Twin Lakes, said he was aiming for what he called “the recession-proof end of the market” — customers who were buying even if the rest of the market was not. But Mr. Smolev said that since the market started its slowdown, the developers were not building any of those homes on speculation.",

    "source": "As Housing in Florida Plummets, the Top Tier of the Market Just Dips <eos> FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Oct. 20 — Despite a record number of foreclosures and a raft of public auctions of unwanted houses, the upper tier of the real estate market in Florida remains relatively immune to the spreading disaster. Houses and condominiums with price tags of $1 million or more are still changing hands robustly in some of the most exclusive areas, though at a pace less brisk than a year ago. The glistening waterfront glass towers on Miami Beach, the sprawling estates set in manicured gardens in Palm Beach and the clustered mansions in Naples are attracting buyers, both domestic and foreign. As in other once-booming regions, in Florida the housing market seems to be not one market, but two. The lower end is littered with vacant houses and unfinished developments, and homeowners are struggling to meet their monthly payments as rates adjust upward. The luxury end has its unsold new condos and mansions lingering on the market, too, but as in New York, where the demand in pricey Manhattan is still strong, sales have fallen less. And Miami and other parts of Florida are continuing to attract interest among the wealthy. Both markets have been buoyed by foreign buyers attracted to the United States because the weak dollar makes American homes comparative bargains. Florida has the added demand from affluent retirees across the country and second-home buyers, particularly from the Northeast. “The very, very high end of the markets in communities such as the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Manhattan and Miami and to a lesser degree Chicago, Seattle and Washington that have global appeal have held up much better than the rest of the housing market,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Economy.com . “A recession would certainly not help the high end, but it would not undermine it. And much of their buying is done with cash and not affected by the global financial turmoil and its impact on the availability of mortgages.” Take the greater Miami area. Over all, home prices have fallen 7.3 percent from their peak in December 2006, according to the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller index that tracks repeat sales of specific homes. But because of a shift upward in the value of the homes that have traded hands, the median price for condos sold so far this year for over $1 million is holding steady at $1.5 million, according to the Realtor Association of Greater Miami and the Beaches . The median price for single-family homes sold is even reported to be up slightly, to $1.51 million from $1.46 million in the 2006 period. In Miami Beach, two brokers, Kevin Tomlinson and Dora Puig, recently represented a buyer from the Midwest who paid $7 million for a beachfront triplex. The sellers, a group of wealthy Mexicans, had bought the apartment for $6.13 million in April 2005, near the height of the market. They put it up for sale in early 2006 for $9.5 million and finally sold it for a 14 percent gain. “When people are realistic about prices, they can sell,” said Mr. Tomlinson, a broker with EWM Realty, an affiliate of Christie’s. Based on the number of sales, the Florida real estate market as a whole has taken a huge hit this year. Unit sales of homes and condominiums worth less than $1 million in Miami-Dade County, for example, fell 37.2 percent through Oct. 23 compared with the period a year earlier. So far in 2007, 7,078 homes have been sold. But even the high end is cooling off. In the greater Miami area, the number of condos and single-family homes that sold for more than $1 million through Oct. 23 fell 18 percent, to 958 units from 1,166 units in the comparable period a year earlier. At the very high end of the market in Naples on Florida’s west coast, there have been about 40 sales so far this year, compared with 46 sales for all of 2006, according to Thomas L. Campbell Jr., sales associate at Premier Properties. In Palm Beach, the number of units sold has fallen 15 percent, to 223 properties. “There is more inventory in all price ranges,” said Deborah Boza Valledor, the chief operating officer of the Realtor Association of Greater Miami and the Beaches. But even as more homes linger on the market, some areas remain particularly popular with potential buyers. “They are waterfront properties that are exclusive,” she said, “and people are willing to pay the price.” Indeed, more than 78,000 homes were for sale in the Miami area in August, up from 51,000 a year before, according to ZipRealty, the real estate brokerage firm. The overhang of unsold homes helps explain why reported selling prices do not tell the whole story. Sellers “are making concessions,” Ms. Boza Valledor said. “They will offer a year’s worth of paid maintenance fees to the buyer, or they will pay for the parking space or they will throw in country club fees that might be part of the expense of buying a home in a gated community.” Just a year ago, when buyers were bidding against one another for properties, such deals would have been unusual. And in another sign that the feeding frenzy has ended, the highest price paid for a Miami-area condo this year was $13.9 million, down from the top price of $16.9 million last year. Mr. Tomlinson, the Christie’s broker, suggests that sellers are starting to be more realistic. “They are coming off their 2005 prices and are more in today’s market,” he said. “Two years ago, if you sold something at $3.5 million, the next listing in that building came at $4.2 million. Now it is more reasonable.” Across the state through the end of September, the real estate company Coldwell Banker has sold 1,222 condos worth a million dollars or more, said Clark W. Toole, who runs the company’s operations in Florida. The average sale price is down less than half a percent from last year. To the degree that the market has held up, it has been helped by eager foreigners, checkbooks in hand, who are still showing up and often paying cash. A survey last year by the National Association of Realtors found that the number of foreign buyers in Florida had dropped significantly from 2005. But of those who bought, 29 percent paid cash. Only 8 percent of domestic purchasers did. More than 10 percent of the foreigners bought homes for over $1 million. The pattern of sales remains uneven, with evidence that some of the most exclusive places are having a harder time. On Fisher Island, the private island just off Miami Beach that has its own golf course, tennis courts and spa, business has slowed sharply, said Lars Ekdahl, who has worked as a real estate agent on the island for 13 years. Right now, the island, which boasts Andre Agassi as a frequent visitor and where Oprah Winfrey once owned a home, has 96 of its 700 housing units for sale. At one point, the number offered was just 39. “I didn’t think it would affect us so much at Fisher Island,” Mr. Ekdahl said, “with the dollar so weak and the euro so strong.” Only about half the island’s residents are Americans. The cost of living on the island has risen because of dues and other expenses, and in a market in which buyers have more choice, they may be pickier. Perhaps the starkest sign of a two-tier housing market is in Palm Beach. The island of Palm Beach itself has about 8,000 housing units. Leslie Evans, a local real estate lawyer, said that about 80 percent of sales there are cash deals and that most buyers are American. But just across the bridge in West Palm Beach, “there are buildings with 200 units and 80 of them are for sale, and others where the building is nearing completion and sales will never close.”",

    "source": "Nominee for South Korean Premier Exits Over Colonization Remarks <eos> SEOUL, South Korea — President Park Geun-hye, whose approval ratings have fallen since an April ferry disaster that left hundreds dead, suffered a new political blow on Tuesday as her second consecutive nominee for prime minister stepped aside, amid an uproar over his suggestion that Korea’s colonization by Japan had been “God’s will.” “Since I was appointed as prime minister, this country has plunged even deeper into severe confrontation and divide,” the nominee, Moon Chang-keuk, said at a news conference. “I have decided that I should help President Park by stepping down of my own will.” Mr. Moon, once a well-known conservative newspaper columnist, was Ms. Park’s second nominee for prime minister to withdraw before his confirmation hearings in the National Assembly could even begin. The first, Ahn Dae-hee, a former Supreme Court justice, stepped aside last month because of a controversy over his post-retirement earnings. Each had been nominated to replace Prime Minister Chung Hong-won, who resigned over the government’s handling of the April 16 ferry sinking, in which more than 300 people were killed, most of them students. The post of prime minister is a largely ceremonial one in South Korea. But the botched appointments cast doubt on Ms. Park’s ability to choose a candidate who could pass the test of public opinion in a country deeply divided over her administration. Mr. Moon’s trouble began when a national television network, KBS, broadcast footage from a 2011 lecture he had given at his Presbyterian church in Seoul. Image Moon Chang-keuk, recently nominated for prime minister, bowed during a news conference announcing his resignation in Seoul. Credit Ahn Young-Joon/Associated Press “We may protest, ‘Why did God make this nation a colony of Japan?’ ” Mr. Moon, an elder at his church, said from the pulpit, according to the video , which circulated widely online. “But as I said earlier, there is God’s will in it.” Mr. Moon also said that the Korean elite had been hopelessly corrupt and inefficient before colonization began in 1910. “Laziness, lack of independence and a tendency to depend on others were in our national DNA,” he said in the speech. God’s message, he said, was that the Koreans “needed hardship,” in the form of colonization. Mr. Moon also said that “in retrospect, it was also God’s will” for Korea to be divided into a Communist North and a pro-American South after Japan’s rule ended with its defeat in World War II. Noting that there were many Communists among Korea’s elite at the time, Mr. Moon said, “Given the way we were then, had Korea been liberated as a whole, it would have been Communized.” Critics interpreted the remarks as a prime-minister-to-be’s justifying his own country’s colonization. They argued that nationalist politicians in Japan, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, would use his remarks to strengthen the case that colonial rule was not as bad as many Koreans have made it out to be. Relations between Japan and South Korea have chilled in recent years, with historical and territorial issues at the root of many disputes. Mr. Moon expressed regret over what he called a “misunderstanding” arising from “a little gap between what can be said inside a church and sentiments of ordinary people.” But he said that political opponents had distorted comments he had made to a private audience. The uproar led to Mr. Moon’s being labeled “pro-Japanese,” a toxic political epithet in South Korea. Even some prominent members of Ms. Park’s party joined the opposition in demanding that Mr. Moon step down. Historical issues involving Japan’s rule over Korea have been problematic for Ms. Park. Her father, the former dictator Park Chung-hee, was once an officer in Japan’s Imperial Army. During Ms. Park’s presidential campaign in 2012, her most outspoken critics cited that part of her family history to argue that she could not be trusted.",

    "source": "Bread Stays on Menu for Carp at Pennsylvania Lake <eos> PITTSBURGH — The carp in Pymatuning Lake will not be denied their daily bread, the Pennsylvania Bureau of State Parks has decided. After being berated for two months by visitors, business owners and elected officials, the state has temporarily called off a plan to force people to stop feeding bread to carp in the lake near Linesville, Pa., and to feed them fish pellets instead. Every year, an estimated 500,000 people trek to the lake in northwestern Pennsylvania to see a veritable carpet of carp in the water. The impromptu roadside attraction is known in part for the sight of ducks walking over the backs of the carp to get at some of the bread themselves. This has spurred Linesville to call itself “Where the Ducks Walk on the Fishes.” In July, the state said it wanted to end the 70-year tradition because it was generating litter and attracting geese that were defecating on local beaches and campgrounds. A community uproar led to a three-hour public meeting on Sept. 8 that attracted nearly 400 people, who nearly unanimously opposed the move. Many worried that the change would deter visitors, who spend money in local restaurants and other businesses. “Hey, with that many people, numbers speak,” Pete Houghton, manager of Pymatuning State Park, said Thursday. That led to a private meeting on Wednesday in Harrisburg, the state capital, between three administrators and local state legislators before a decision was reached. The state will monitor the litter and geese population over the next year and see if it can be managed without an end to the bread-feeding.",

    "source": "On the Road With the Two Jon Corzines <eos> TRENTON FORGET Bon Jovi’s “Who Says You Can’t Go Home” or Bruce’s “Born to Run.” For Gov. Jon S. Corzine , the most apt anthem for his budget-cutting road show these days is Twisted Sister’s “We’re Not Gonna Take It.” First, you had several thousand teachers, firefighters and state employees blaring the song from the State House steps in December 2006 to protest a suggested change to pension and health benefits. Then, you had hundreds of angry devotees of the talk radio station WKXW-FM (101.5), who used the same song earlier this month, on the same steps, to protest Mr. Corzine’s toll road plan and blame public workers for the state’s fiscal mess. Small wonder, then, that Mr. Corzine seems to be struggling with how to balance the interests of pro- and anti-union forces as he promotes his plan to reduce state debt and finance transportation projects with sharply higher tolls. One moment, he defiantly dismisses suggestions that the state tear up years of contracts it has made with state workers and other civil servants. Teachers, firefighters, police officers and other municipal employees in New Jersey are generally covered by the state’s pension and retirement rules and benefits. If the state were simply to ignore those contracts, he says, no one — not Wall Street, not the federal government — would ever trust New Jersey’s word again. “We are a country of laws,” Mr. Corzine said last month at a town hall meeting in Middle Township. The next moment, however, he sounds like the kind of bottom-line, anti-union chief executive officer he presumably clashed with regularly on Wall Street. He reminds people that he increased the retirement age in 2007 and forced state workers to chip in for health insurance for the first time. “I’m the first governor in 25 years who has actually taken anything away from anybody,” he told an audience at East Brunswick High School two weeks ago. Now, as he prepares to unveil a budget on Tuesday that will very likely include deep cuts totaling $2.5 billion, Mr. Corzine is training his red pen on state workers again. He is weighing a reduction in the state work force by 3,000 jobs, probably through early retirement, as well as the elimination of the Department of Personnel and other agencies. But whether these cuts will be substantive or merely symbolic is anyone’s guess. And it’s part of the reason that labor experts remain uncertain as to which Mr. Corzine will show up: The one who has long been labor’s staunch ally? Or the one who has been stung by the raw anti-public worker sentiment voiced at the 13 town hall meetings he has held so far? “I think right now he is trying to find a center that he can turn to that will support him,” said Joseph A. Golowski, a retired state auditor who is now a labor consultant. “If he says it just to keep people happy, that’s one thing. If he actually means to worm away their benefits — eat away at the benefits — then that’s another.” Mr. Corzine clearly has his work cut out for him. A Quinnipiac University poll on Wednesday showed his ratings at 37 percent approving of his performance, and, in an all-time high, 52 percent disapproving. But in his town hall meetings, public employees — not Mr. Corzine — are the audience’s No. 1 scapegoat for all of New Jersey’s ills. At a meeting in Cranford last month, for instance, Joy Atkin, a retired teacher from Union Township, was booed when she expressed concern she would not receive the full benefits to which she thought she was entitled. “Pay for it!” someone shouted. Meanwhile, at a meeting in Voorhees, Mr. Corzine received robust applause when he talked about how he had pushed the retirement age for new public workers to 60, from 55. Indeed, he said he hoped to push it even higher in the next contract in 2011. “In the next contract, we’ll probably push it out to match up with the private sector,” the governor said. Yet at times Mr. Corzine has been just as vigorous in defending the state’s public workers. For instance, he said teachers were crucial to the success of New Jersey’s students, sometimes mentioning that his mother was a teacher. He has also aggressively wooed labor leaders, and has managed to persuade a few key groups to endorse his toll plan. Those involved in the building trades — construction workers, ironworkers and others — have been especially supportive, because they think it will create more jobs. Some ironworkers even showed up en masse at the governor’s Mays Landing forum and often drowned out critics of Mr. Corzine’s, including Steven M. Lonegan, a former (and possibly future) Republican candidate for governor. The ironworkers were joined by a vocal band of casino workers, led by Robert McDevitt, president of Unite-Here Local 54. Unions may not actually be buying into the plan yet, but they would like to give Mr. Corzine a little leeway — at least until Tuesday. “It’s a symbolic beating up of labor, so I would be surprised if people were really upset with him,” said Adrienne E. Eaton, a professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers. “I think that he’s sending a real signal that they need to support his budget plan and toll plan — or else.” Or else...Twisted Sister, anyone?",

    "source": "Some Biologists Find an Urge in Human Nature to Help <eos> What is the essence of human nature? Flawed, say many theologians. Vicious and addicted to warfare, wrote Hobbes. Selfish and in need of considerable improvement, think many parents. But biologists are beginning to form a generally sunnier view of humankind. Their conclusions are derived in part from testing very young children, and partly from comparing human children with those of chimpanzees, hoping that the differences will point to what is distinctively human. The somewhat surprising answer at which some biologists have arrived is that babies are innately sociable and helpful to others. Of course every animal must to some extent be selfish to survive. But the biologists also see in humans a natural willingness to help. When infants 18 months old see an unrelated adult whose hands are full and who needs assistance opening a door or picking up a dropped clothespin, they will immediately help, Michael Tomasello writes in “ Why We Cooperate ,” a book published in October. Dr. Tomasello, a developmental psychologist, is co-director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany . The helping behavior seems to be innate because it appears so early and before many parents start teaching children the rules of polite behavior. “It’s probably safe to assume that they haven’t been explicitly and directly taught to do this,” said Elizabeth Spelke, a developmental psychologist at Harvard. “On the other hand, they’ve had lots of opportunities to experience acts of helping by others. I think the jury is out on the innateness question.” But Dr. Tomasello finds the helping is not enhanced by rewards, suggesting that it is not influenced by training. It seems to occur across cultures that have different timetables for teaching social rules. And helping behavior can even be seen in infant chimpanzees under the right experimental conditions. For all these reasons, Dr. Tomasello concludes that helping is a natural inclination, not something imposed by parents or culture. Infants will help with information, as well as in practical ways. From the age of 12 months they will point at objects that an adult pretends to have lost. Chimpanzees, by contrast, never point at things for each other, and when they point for people, it seems to be as a command to go fetch something rather than to share information. For parents who may think their children somehow skipped the cooperative phase, Dr. Tomasello offers the reassuring advice that children are often more cooperative outside the home, which is why parents may be surprised to hear from a teacher or coach how nice their child is. “In families, the competitive element is in ascendancy,” he said. As children grow older, they become more selective in their helpfulness. Starting around age 3, they will share more generously with a child who was previously nice to them. Another behavior that emerges at the same age is a sense of social norms. “Most social norms are about being nice to other people,” Dr. Tomasello said in an interview, “so children learn social norms because they want to be part of the group.” Children not only feel they should obey these rules themselves, but also that they should make others in the group do the same. Even 3-year-olds are willing to enforce social norms. If they are shown how to play a game, and a puppet then joins in with its own idea of the rules, the children will object, some of them vociferously. Where do they get this idea of group rules, the sense of “we who do it this way”? Dr. Tomasello believes children develop what he calls “shared intentionality,” a notion of what others expect to happen and hence a sense of a group “we.” It is from this shared intentionality that children derive their sense of norms and of expecting others to obey them. Shared intentionality, in Dr. Tomasello’s view, is close to the essence of what distinguishes people from chimpanzees. A group of human children will use all kinds of words and gestures to form goals and coordinate activities, but young chimps seem to have little interest in what may be their companions’ minds. If children are naturally helpful and sociable, what system of child-rearing best takes advantage of this surprising propensity? Dr. Tomasello says that the approach known as inductive parenting works best because it reinforces the child’s natural propensity to cooperate with others. Inductive parenting is simply communicating with children about the effect of their actions on others and emphasizing the logic of social cooperation. “Children are altruistic by nature,” he writes, and though they are also naturally selfish, all parents need do is try to tip the balance toward social behavior. The shared intentionality lies at the basis of human society, Dr. Tomasello argues. From it flow ideas of norms, of punishing those who violate the norms and of shame and guilt for punishing oneself. Shared intentionality evolved very early in the human lineage, he believes, and its probable purpose was for cooperation in gathering food. Anthropologists report that when men cooperate in hunting, they can take down large game, which single hunters generally cannot do. Chimpanzees gather to hunt colobus monkeys, but Dr. Tomasello argues this is far less of a cooperative endeavor because the participants act on an ad hoc basis and do not really share their catch. An interesting bodily reflection of humans’ shared intentionality is the sclera, or whites, of the eyes. All 200 or so species of primates have dark eyes and a barely visible sclera. All, that is, except humans, whose sclera is three times as large, a feature that makes it much easier to follow the direction of someone else’s gaze. Chimps will follow a person’s gaze, but by looking at his head, even if his eyes are closed. Babies follow a person’s eyes, even if the experimenter keeps his head still. Advertising what one is looking at could be a risk. Dr. Tomasello argues that the behavior evolved “in cooperative social groups in which monitoring one another’s focus was to everyone’s benefit in completing joint tasks.” This could have happened at some point early in human evolution, when in order to survive, people were forced to cooperate in hunting game or gathering fruit. The path to obligatory cooperation — one that other primates did not take — led to social rules and their enforcement, to human altruism and to language. “Humans putting their heads together in shared cooperative activities are thus the originators of human culture,” Dr. Tomasello writes. A similar conclusion has been reached independently by Hillard S. Kaplan, an anthropologist at the University of New Mexico . Modern humans have lived for most of their existence as hunter gatherers, so much of human nature has presumably been shaped for survival in such conditions. From study of existing hunter gatherer peoples, Dr. Kaplan has found evidence of cooperation woven into many levels of human activity. The division of labor between men and women — men gather 68 percent of the calories in foraging societies — requires cooperation between the sexes. Young people in these societies consume more than they produce until age 20, which in turn requires cooperation between the generations. This long period of dependency was needed to develop the special skills required for the hunter gatherer way of life. The structure of early human societies, including their “high levels of cooperation between kin and nonkin,” was thus an adaptation to the “specialized foraging niche” of food resources that were too difficult for other primates to capture, Dr. Kaplan and colleagues wrote recently in The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. We evolved to be nice to each other, in other words, because there was no alternative. Much the same conclusion is reached by Frans de Waal in another book published in October, “The Age of Empathy.” Dr. de Waal, a primatologist, has long studied the cooperative side of primate behavior and believes that aggression, which he has also studied, is often overrated as a human motivation. “We’re preprogrammed to reach out,” Dr. de Waal writes. “Empathy is an automated response over which we have limited control.” The only people emotionally immune to another’s situation, he notes, are psychopaths. Indeed, it is in our biological nature, not our political institutions, that we should put our trust, in his view. Our empathy is innate and cannot be changed or long suppressed. “In fact,” Dr. de Waal writes, “I’d argue that biology constitutes our greatest hope. One can only shudder at the thought that the humaneness of our societies would depend on the whims of politics, culture or religion.” The basic sociability of human nature does not mean, of course, that people are nice to each other all the time. Social structure requires that things be done to maintain it, some of which involve negative attitudes toward others. The instinct for enforcing norms is powerful, as is the instinct for fairness. Experiments have shown that people will reject unfair distributions of money even it means they receive nothing. “Humans clearly evolved the ability to detect inequities, control immediate desires, foresee the virtues of norm following and gain the personal, emotional rewards that come from seeing another punished,” write three Harvard biologists, Marc Hauser, Katherine McAuliffe and Peter R. Blake, in reviewing their experiments with tamarin monkeys and young children. If people do bad things to others in their group, they can behave even worse to those outside it. Indeed the human capacity for cooperation “seems to have evolved mainly for interactions within the local group,” Dr. Tomasello writes. Sociality, the binding together of members of a group, is the first requirement of defense, since without it people will not put the group’s interests ahead of their own or be willing to sacrifice their lives in battle. Lawrence H. Keeley, an anthropologist who has traced aggression among early peoples, writes in his book “War Before Civilization” that, “Warfare is ultimately not a denial of the human capacity for cooperation, but merely the most destructive expression of it.” The roots of human cooperation may lie in human aggression. We are selfish by nature, yet also follow rules requiring us to be nice to others. “That’s why we have moral dilemmas,” Dr. Tomasello said, “because we are both selfish and altruistic at the same time.”",

    "source": "U.S. Lugers See Medals With Tunnel Vision <eos> SAN DIEGO — Mark Grimmette’s duty for the day was more appropriate for a mannequin than an Olympian. In a chamber that looked like a set from a science fiction movie, Grimmette lay on a sled while winds between 65 and 80 miles an hour blew over him. From an adjacent room, three engineers recorded their path over his body. Grimmette , who will make his fifth trip to the Olympics in the sport of luge, journeyed last week from a World Cup race in Italy to the San Diego Air & Space Technology Center to perform tests that could have significant ramifications at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. In the center’s Low Speed Wind Tunnel , a 63-year-old laboratory that has helped in the development of fighter jets and missiles, Grimmette tested the wind’s drag on four different suits. In luge, the time differential between gold and silver can be heartbreakingly narrow. It is the only Winter Olympic sport that measures finishes to the thousandth of a second. A fraction of time shaved here or there can be crucial, which was why Grimmette played part fashion model, part corpse for the day, while his suits were analyzed . “We don’t use a model dummy because it’s too hard to put a suit onto that,” Grimmette said. “But it turns out I’m not a bad dummy.” After trying out one suit , Grimmette changed into another. Details as subtle as where a sponsor’s decal is painted can add or subtract fractions of a second. While Grimmette changed suits, Gordy Sheer, USA Luge ’s director for marketing and sponsorship and a 1998 silver medalist in luge, asked David Sanford, the facility’s aerotest engineering manager, if the cold in Canada could alter the results here. “It would change the density,” Sanford said. “So it would make the drag a little heavier, but all the relativity stays the same.” Grimmette grunted as he tried to shimmy into a suit. “Can you breathe?” Sheer asked. The three sliding sports in the Olympics — luge, bobsled and skeleton — share a narrow relationship between technology and athleticism. Purists do not want to tip the line too much toward technology. Still, each country looks for any advantage, no matter how tiny. The Canadian sliding teams created an intricate camera system to study every angle during their trial runs at the Whistler Sliding Centre. And the United States bobsled team has maintained a close relationship with the racecar driver Geoff Bodine to develop sleds using Nascar technology. Four years between Olympics mean four years to study and improve performance. When Grimmette, who has won silver and bronze medals with his luge partner, Brian Martin, once wore a suit deemed fast by competitors, he noticed them touching the fabric as they congratulated him. “There’s definitely a philosophy out there,” Grimmette said. “Some sports tend to want to go more in the technology direction, some sports want to go in the athletic direction. Our sport is still very much based in the athletic parts, and I like that. But I am interested in the science and the physics of the sport. It’s a nice blend of both.” The tunnel itself is a blend of two eras. Several monitors show the testing chamber in an adjacent room. The control panel, including the knob that adjusts the wind speed, is the original equipment from six decades ago. The computer data server spits out green numbers that look as if they are from “ The Matrix .” The other computers are of more recent vintage. A fan in another room — six wooden blades 20 feet in diameter — spun at up to 800 rotations a minute. The wind, gaining speed, circulated around Grimmette through a narrow space. Construction on the Low Speed Wind Tunnel began in 1944 with the idea that it would help manufacture defense products for World War II. “But the war ended before the facility was finished,” said the tunnel’s general manager, Donna Simon. It was once scheduled for closure, but it has remained in operation, benefiting most notably the aerospace and commercial airline industries. The tunnel has conducted tests for Boeing, Cessna and Northrop Grumman. It has performed scale-model examinations of city blocks, skyscrapers, Jack Murphy Stadium (now Qualcomm) in San Diego and the Astrodome in Houston. The tunnel, one of the few in the country, simulates wind speeds up to 270 miles per hour. More recently, the tunnel has been put to use by athletes. Many top cyclists, including Lance Armstrong, have done aerodynamic testing inside it. Sheer learned of the tunnel from the cyclist John Hay and thought it could also help his luge team. Nearly every member has come here, as have some members of the skeleton team. With Grimmette on the sled, itself on a circular platform that measures drag coefficient, Sheer made sure his head was in the exact position as in the other tests. They traced Grimmette’s outline on a monitor to make sure he maintained the position, so that the only variable was his suit. After Sheer left the chamber, the tunnel’s operations manager, Dave Noon, compiled data as the wind speeds increased five miles an hour at 15-second intervals. A data systems engineer filmed and monitored the information in case there were subtle differences among the test runs. The drag was measured in grams. The lower the drag, the faster Grimmette would go. “That was the fastest,” Sanford said as Grimmette exited. “Thirty grams faster than the first. Fifty grams better than the second. Not a lot, but still better.” It was Grimmette’s eighth trip to the tunnel. He said he sometimes felt claustrophobic in the chamber and had to remind himself to calm down. Other times, his muscles have cramped in the cold wind. “It’s not the most glamorous job out there,” Grimmette said. Suits of different breathability and textures of smoothness are tested. Each costs around $500. Grimmette tried on one more — a suit that the luger Tony Benshoof has sworn is the fastest. The test results showed that it was not. Grimmette and Sheer selected the one with the lowest drag time, the model that the team would wear in Vancouver. The suit is manufactured by Karbon, a Canadian sports apparel company. But it did not matter that the fabric was made outside the United States. Grimmette had already proved that he was willing to think outside the box, or at least inside the chamber, in order to contend.",

    "source": "New Rocket Has Problem With Vibration <eos> WASHINGTON (AP) — NASA is working to solve a potentially dangerous vibration problem in its next generation of launching vehicles. Engineers are concerned that a new rocket, the Ares I, which will replace the space shuttle and send astronauts on their way to the moon, could shake violently during the first minutes of flight. The problem is common to solid rocket boosters. If not corrected, the shaking, which arises from the powerful first stage of the rocket, could “shake apart the whole structure,” said Paul Fischbeck, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University. “They know it’s a real problem,” said Professor Fischbeck, who has consulted on risk issues with NASA. The concern is not the shaking of the first stage, but how it affects everything that sits on top: the Orion crew capsule, instrument unit and a booster. NASA officials said they hoped to have a plan for fixing the design as early as March and did not expect the problem to delay the goal of returning astronauts to the moon by 2020. “I hope no one was so ill-informed as to believe that we would be able to develop a system to replace the shuttle without facing any challenges in doing so,” the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said in a statement to The Associated Press. “NASA has an excellent track record of resolving technical challenges,” Dr. Griffin said. “We’re confident we’ll solve this one as well.” Professor Jorge Arenas of the Institute of Acoustics in Valdivia, Chile, said that the problem was serious but added that “NASA has developed one of the safest and risk-controlled space programs in engineering history.” Since 2005, the space agency has been working on a plan to return to the moon, at a cost of more than $100 billion. Two rockets are planned, the Ares I, which would carry the astronauts into space, and the Ares V, an unmanned heavy cargo ship. That rocket’s first stage is composed of five segments derived from the solid boosters that NASA uses to launch the shuttle. The shaking problem involves pulses of added acceleration caused by gas vortexes similar to the wake that develops behind a fast-moving boat, said Professor Arenas, who has researched vibration and space launching issues. The Ares I vortexes match the natural vibrating frequencies of the rocket’s combustion chamber, and the combination causes the shaking. Senior managers were told of the findings last fall, but NASA did not talk about them publicly until The Associated Press filed a Freedom of Information Act request this month and the watchdog Web site Nasawatch.com submitted detailed engineering-oriented questions. The first launching of astronauts aboard Ares I and Orion is scheduled for March 2015.",

    "source": "U.S. Fears Hezbollah Operative Held in Iraq May Go Free <eos> WASHINGTON — A senior Iraqi official has told the Obama administration that Iraq no longer has a legal basis to hold a Lebanese Hezbollah operative who has been accused of helping to kill American troops in Iraq, and United States officials are concerned that he may soon be released, American officials said Sunday. American officials said that the United States ambassador in Baghdad, Robert S. Beecroft, had been instructed to seek a meeting with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq to urge that the Hezbollah operative, Ali Musa Daqduq, be kept in detention. At the same time, however, American officials are worried that their efforts may fall short, and they quietly informed Congressional leaders last week that there was a risk that Mr. Daqduq may soon go free. Mr. Daqduq, who was captured by British forces in Basra in March 2007, was the last detainee to be handed over to the Iraqis by the United States as American troops withdrew in December 2011. American military officials have accused Mr. Daqduq of working with the Quds Force — an Iranian paramilitary unit that supports militant movements abroad — to train Shiite militias in Iraq during the war. One of the most serious allegations stems from his suspected role in helping to organize a January 2007 raid in Karbala that led to the deaths of five American soldiers. The case is politically delicate for the White House not just because of the allegations against Mr. Daqduq but also because of the timing. Some Iraqi officials have previously suggested that they would seek to mollify the Obama administration by putting off releasing Mr. Daqduq until the presidential campaign was over, but American officials repeatedly insisted that they did not want him released at all. “The United States continues to believe that Daqduq should be held accountable for his crimes,” said a State Department official, who asked not be identified because he was discussing a delicate diplomatic issue. A spokeswoman for the National Security Council declined to comment. Mr. Daqduq, a member of Hezbollah since 1983, once supervised the security detail for Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s supreme leader. He worked in the group’s external operations unit, and has repeatedly visited the Tehran headquarters of the Quds Force. Mr. Daqduq was captured during a raid in Basra on March 20, 2007, that also netted Laith Khazali and his brother Qais, the leaders of a Shiite group known as Asaib Ahl al-Haq. A hard drive recovered at the site contained documents about the planning of the Karbala raid and even scanned copies of the contents of the wallet of one of the Americans killed in the attack. When he was captured, Mr. Daqduq at first pretended to be deaf and unable to speak, a pose that American officials believe was intended to keep his accent from betraying his Lebanese origins. Later, though, he began to talk while in American custody, officials said. After Mr. Daqduq was transferred to Iraqi custody, an Iraqi court ruled that there was not enough evidence to hold him. The United States sought his extradition for trial by an American military tribunal , but that request was turned down. The charge sheet prepared by American military prosecutors accused him of murder, terrorism and espionage, among other crimes. President Obama urged Mr. Maliki not to release Mr. Daqduq when the Iraqi prime minister visited the United States in December 2011. Iran, meanwhile, is believed to have been pressing for his release, making his fate something of a test case for Iraq’s relations with the United States. Mr. Daqduq is believed to be living under house arrest in the Green Zone area of Baghdad. “It is a symbolic test for Maliki,” said Ramzy Mardini, an adjunct fellow at the Iraq Institute for Strategic Studies, based in Beirut. “Is he more concerned about his relationship with Tehran or his relationship with Washington?” Relations between Iraq and the United States are under strain from other issues like continued flights by aircraft from Iran to Syria that are believed to carry military supplies for government forces. Under American pressure, Baghdad ordered two flights to land in Iraq for inspection, but no military supplies were found. Last spring, an internal American government assessment observed that Iraq appeared to be calculating that it could keep Mr. Daqduq detained long enough to appease the Americans but not so long as to offend Iran and Hezbollah. The possibility that Mr. Daqduq might be released soon was raised in a discussion last week between a senior adviser to Mr. Maliki and a senior Obama administration official, American officials said. “We continue to work closely with the Iraqi government to explore any possible legal options that may remain in this case,” the State Department official said. “We appreciate the steps the Iraqi government has taken so far in seeking to hold Daqduq accountable.”",

    "source": "Down Quarter Ends a Difficult Year for 3 Airlines <eos> Three big airlines — Continental, JetBlue and US Airways — each reported deeper fourth-quarter losses on Thursday amid pessimism over the near-term outlook for air travel. The results essentially completed a dismal set of fourth-quarter reports for the industry, which has suffered whiplash in the last year, first from record fuel prices that peaked during the summer, then from the sour economy. Airlines began cutting flights, routes and aircraft in the fourth quarter, in reaction to jet fuel prices that at one point in 2008 were nearly double what they paid in 2007. Carriers thought the retrenchment, which is expected to continue this year, would allow them to charge higher ticket prices. But passengers balked at paying more, and companies pulled back on business travel in the wake of the economic slump. Now, lots of carriers are instituting fare sales in hopes of winning back travelers. “You have an operating backdrop that rivals any we’ve seen in our industry for the past few years,” Lawrence W. Kellner, the chief executive of Continental Airlines , told analysts during a conference call. Continental lost $266 million, or $2.33 a share, compared with $32 million, or 33 cents a share, in the 2007 quarter. The 2008 result included a one-time charge of $169 million to pay for retirement costs for pilots, and to reflect losses on fuel hedging contracts, an issue that also has affected other airlines. Many carriers lock in the price of fuel in advance, a strategy that can protect them when prices rise. But when the cost of jet fuel drops, airlines have to take charges to account for the difference between the hedge price and the going rate. Revenue at Continental was $3.5 billion, down 1.5 percent. Continental noted a significant shift in its international flights from first-class to coach travel. Several companies have banned first-class business travel as a cost-cutting move. “Our international business is pretty solid,” Mr. Kellner said. “It’s just not as profitable as it used to be.” Continental shares dropped 10.6 percent, to $14.51. US Airways, which was in the news earlier this month when one of its planes made an emergency landing in the Hudson River, said it lost $541 million, or $4.74 a share, compared with a $79 million loss, or 87 cents a share in the 2007 quarter. Revenue at US Airways was $2.76 billion, essentially flat with 2007. The airline took a special charge of $234 million that included its impact from fuel hedging contracts. US Airways shares fell 11.37 percent, to $6.47. JetBlue Airways said it lost $49 million, before taxes, in the fourth quarter compared with a pretax loss of $3 million in 2007. The 2008 results included a one-time charge of $53 million to revalue auction-rate securities. JetBlue said its results were preliminary and would be completed after it determined the tax implications of its special charge. Its revenue was $811 million, up nearly 10 percent. It shares fell 2.74 percent, or 18 cents, to $6.38. JetBlue, which has grown rapidly since it began flying in 2000, said it expected to reduce its flights by 2 percent in 2009. But the airline announced plans to start service from Kennedy International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport, and said it would add service to Jamaica. David Barger, the chief executive of JetBlue, told analysts that voting among its pilots would end Tuesday on whether they would join a new union, the JetBlue Pilots Association . The group is independent of the nation’s biggest pilots’ union, the Air Line Pilots Association.",

    "source": "Hollywood DeaIs Are Stirring but Still Not Hopping <eos> A DEGREE of financial fizz has returned to Hollywood, but the industry is showing uncharacteristic restraint in its celebration. On Aug. 17, Steven Spielberg secured $325 million in additional movie financing. Two weeks later, the Walt Disney Company plunked down $4 billion for Marvel Entertainment. Universal is refinancing $1 billion in theme park debt. Now $525 million in financing to equip thousands of movie theaters with 3-D equipment is finally moving forward. “Is this a loosening of capital markets, especially where entertainment is involved?” asked Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation and a 3-D proponent. “The answer to that is yes.” Even so, Mr. Katzenberg and other industry veterans say Rockette kicks about a broader show-business recovery are premature. After more than a year of almost no activity, these deals do suggest that Hollywood is regaining its footing in a sharply changed entertainment sector. DVD sales, for instance, may never be as strong as they once were, but they will continue, and broadband video-on-demand is right around the corner and can probably pick up some of the slack. And the overall economy has started to improve. Some media executives, including Rupert Murdoch, have said advertising is starting to rebound. The Federal Reserve chairman has speculated that the recession has ended. Last week, there were five initial public offerings of stock, the most in a five-day period since 2007, and one of them was in entertainment, for Shanda Games Limited. (The I.P.O. raised $1.04 billion, though the share price soon dropped. ) But the current surge of deal-making cannot be easily extrapolated as evidence that a full recovery is blooming. Consider the Marvel deal. “The acquisition may indicate an improving merger-and-acquisition environment with robust pricing and demand for content assets,” Michael C. Morris, a UBS analyst, wrote in a research note on Sept. 1. But some longtime Hollywood watchers see it more as an anomaly: Few media conglomerates have Disney’s buying power, and Marvel, with its 5,000-strong stable of comic book heroes, is not your average content company. And these two mates, with their focus on merchandising, were a distinctive fit. Sometimes a deal is just a deal. The 3-D financing, organized by JPMorgan on behalf of three multiplex chains, will greatly increase the ability of studios to exploit the genre. But it isn’t particularly indicative of a broader recovery, either, Mr. Katzenberg said. “It’s a utility: how many 3-D screens are you going to have available and over how many years?” he asked. “It’s not a bet on a creative project like a film that hasn’t been made yet.” Despite Mr. Spielberg’s ability to raise cash — he’s also an anomaly in his power to deliver megahits — film financing remains frozen on all but the smallest levels. Most studios, like 20th Century Fox and Sony, don’t have to worry yet because they made long-term financing deals before the downturn. But studios like Universal could be in a bind as their film financing deals mature. And others are encountering difficulties going it alone. A few weeks ago, Paramount, which does not have a large pool of outside financing to help bankroll its movies, pushed back the release of Martin Scorsese’s next picture, “Shutter Island,” until February, citing difficulty swallowing the marketing expense in 2009 amid the DVD downturn. The independent film market still has a long way to go, despite glimmers of improvement. IndieVest, a company that finances, produces and distributes films with budgets of up to $12 million, contends it has had a “dramatic increase” in investor interest in recent weeks. But the recent Toronto International Film Festival , a barometer of the art house sector, was essentially a commercial washout. “The market is still severely challenged,” said John Sloss, a top sales agent for independent films. So where does that leave Hollywood? Mark Patricof, managing partner of Mesa, a New York investment bank focused on media and technology, says deal-making will return in force to entertainment in the coming months, in part because of the industry’s me-too mentality. Mesa has been behind a smattering of recent activity, including the $25 million sale of NowPublic, a Web site for citizen-generated media. “You’re going to see a lot of deals start to happen before the end of the year,” Mr. Patricof said. Others contend that media companies like Time Warner that do have cash are under pressure to pull the trigger on something big. Stephen Prough, managing director of Salem Partners, a Los Angeles investment bank specializing in entertainment and technology, says companies are starting to hunt for near-term acquisitions that “have scale in the context of their overall business.” What kinds of deals might be percolating? Executives at General Electric have said they expect that Vivendi may soon exercise its right to sell its 20 percent stake in NBC Universal, a move that could make the company an attractive takeover target. Vivendi has been silent on the matter. (G.E. owns the other 80 percent.) People are said to be kicking the tires on DreamWorks Animation, which is increasing production from two to three movies a year. Mr. Katzenberg declined to comment on the M & A chatter around his company. And will Disney’s boutique film unit, Miramax, be in play? A Disney spokeswoman said that Miramax is not for sale. But Disney was moving to jettison it before the downturn, and housecleaning at Walt Disney Studios — the chairman Dick Cook resigned under pressure on Sept. 18 — has renewed speculation about Miramax’s future. Veterans, meanwhile, are preaching the virtues of slow and steady. Amir Malin, a partner at Qualia Capital, a media-focused investment firm, and the former chief of Artisan Entertainment, said, “If you have cash and invest poorly, then we’re simply going to see a repeat of yesteryear where people invested heavily in toxic deals.”",

    "source": "Man Who Filmed Execution Is Arrested, Saudi Outlets Say <eos> BEIRUT, Lebanon — In a recent video from Saudi Arabia, three uniformed security officers and a professional swordsman in a white gown struggled to placate a woman cloaked in black and sitting in the street. A Saudi court had convicted her of murder, but she was proclaiming her innocence. Then the officers stepped back, the swordsman took aim and the woman shrieked and fell silent as he struck her neck with his blade, three times in total. Medics wearing white gloves tended to the body, and the swordsman wiped his blade with a cloth. The video was distributed by human rights activists and posted online after the execution in the city of Mecca on Jan. 12, shedding light on the way Saudi Arabia applies the death penalty. On Sunday, Saudi news outlets reported that the authorities had arrested the man who had shot the video and planned to prosecute him. Although the reports did not specify what charges he faced, an Interior Ministry spokesman said such matters fell under the country’s law against cybercrimes. Saudi Arabia, a hereditary monarchy governed by a strict interpretation of Shariah , the legal code of Islam based on the Quran, is an economic and military ally of the United States. But some of its practices have come under greater scrutiny with the rise of the Islamic State extremist group in Iraq and Syria, which also claims to rule according to Shariah law and has shocked the world with videos of its fighters beheading captives. The kingdom recently delayed the second round of the public caning of a writer sentenced to 1,000 blows for running a liberal website after his sentence was criticized by the State Department and the United Nations . That followed an uproar caused by a video of the first round of the punishment that was posted online. Many Saudis object to their country’s being compared to the Islamic State, saying that Saudi Arabia executes only those convicted of grave crimes, while the fighters of the Islamic State indiscriminately kill those who do not share their Sunni Muslim faith. International human rights organizations have criticized the Saudi justice system, and two United Nations human rights experts called for a moratorium on beheadings in Saudi Arabia last year, labeling them “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.” Although Saudi Arabia criminalizes any words or acts that insult the Prophet Muhammad, it condemned the deadly attack this month on the newspaper Charlie Hebdo in France and has joined the American-led air campaign against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Still, some Saudis worry about how domestic practices affect their image abroad. “You reach a stage where you can’t defend the country,” said Khaled Almaeena, a social and media analyst who lives in Jidda. “I can’t go on a platform in Europe and say that everything is hunky dory when someone is being lashed every Friday.” Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and commentator, said that while some Saudis saw the damage such practices caused abroad, the government faced little opposition domestically, partly because of the belief that Islamic punishments should be carried out in public. “It is the Saudi Foreign Ministry that will face the heat, but locally we don’t have a problem with that,” he said of public executions. Saudi Arabia, a country of 27 million, executed 87 people last year for crimes like rape, murder, armed robbery and drug trafficking, according to a count compiled by Human Rights Watch. It has executed 11 people so far this year. While most executions are believed to be beheadings, the government does not usually disclose the method used. The United States, by contrast, executed 35 people last year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center , using methods that are not always flawless . According to the state-run Saudi Press Agency, the executed woman was a citizen of Myanmar who had been convicted of severely beating her husband’s 7-year-old daughter, also from Myanmar, and violating her with a broomstick “without mercy or pity, which led to her death.” In the video, which appeared to have been filmed with a mobile phone, the women repeatedly yelled, “I didn’t kill! I didn’t kill!” and “This is oppression!” in Arabic while the men positioned her for the blows of the sword. The Saudi newspaper Okaz reported on Sunday that the police in Mecca had arrested a security officer who had filmed the beheading and that he would face both military and civilian justice. Another Saudi newspaper, Al-Riyadh, cited Lt. Col. Atta al-Quraishi, a spokesman for the Mecca police, as saying that the man would be turned over to the “relevant authorities.” The Interior Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Mansour Turki, said in a text message that he had no information about the reported arrest but that such cases were handled according to the country’s cybercrime law.",

    "source": "Another Academic Group Considers Israel Censure <eos> CHICAGO — A movement to pressure and isolate Israel gained further ground among American academics on Saturday, when the Modern Language Association took a step toward approving a resolution calling on the State Department to contest what it characterized as Israel’s discriminatory “denials of entry” to American scholars seeking to visit the West Bank to work at Palestinian universities. After nearly three hours of fractious debate and procedural maneuvering, the group’s delegate assembly voted 60 to 53 to adopt the resolution, which will be submitted to the group’s nearly 28,000 members after review by its executive council. If it is approved, the Modern Language Association would be the fourth, and by far the largest, such group to endorse a measure critical of Israel in the past year. The travel resolution did not call for a boycott like the one announced last month by the American Studies Association , which has prompted a backlash , including statements from more than 100 university presidents criticizing boycotts as a threat to academic freedom. The group’s delegate assembly also voted against considering a second resolution, introduced by its Radical Caucus, to condemn the “attacks on the A.S.A.” and defend the right of individual scholars and groups to “take positions in solidarity with the Palestinian struggle against racism.” But among partisans on both sides, the debate on the resolution was seen as an important skirmish in the larger battle over the international boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement , known as B.D.S. “The main goal of the process is raising awareness of egregious and decades-long complicity of Israeli institutions in the regime of occupation, colonialism and apartheid,” Omar Barghouti, a Palestinian founder of B.D.S., said on Thursday after participating in a round-table discussion of academic boycotts. Before the group’s four-day annual meeting began, the debate seemed to bring as much attention to the policies of the M.L.A., starting with the approval last spring of the round table on boycotts. Two pro-Israel groups, Hillel International and the Israel on Campus Coalition, issued a statement criticizing the group for accepting a lineup with only scholars who were broadly supportive of the B.D.S. movement. They also organized a counterpanel at a nearby hotel featuring prominent M.L.A. members who are opposed to boycotts. Some of them defended the group’s right to approve such a gathering, saying that many scholarly panels are devoted to exploring one point of view. But at the panel, and in leaflets distributed during the meeting, they questioned the documentary evidence provided by supporters of the travel resolution, as well as its singular focus on Israel. “I would strongly support a resolution looking into refusal of visas for all countries,” Cary Nelson, a former president of the American Association of University Professors, said during the debate on Saturday. He added: “This is a biased resolution.” Full passage is by no means assured. Some of the scholars chatting in the halls between panels on topics like “Middle English Keywords” or “African American Voices From the Civil War” said they were unconcerned about the measure, or even unaware of it. Others expressed dismay at what they saw as a conversation that slid too quickly on both sides from issues of academic freedom to partisan claims. “It arrived partisan, and it never had a chance to become nonpartisan,” said Derrick Miller, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington and a member of the delegate assembly. “I hear echoes of cable news debates rather than something academic.” Discussion grew even more heated at the assembly. Mr. Nelson suggested that removing the word “arbitrary” from the resolution’s description of Israel’s denials of entry had made the resolution meaningless, while supporters criticized a last-minute effort to introduce a substitute resolution applying to all governments as “procedural obstruction.” After the vote, Mr. Nelson and other opponents predicted it would damage the association and its broader mission of promoting the beleaguered humanities. But Bruce Robbins, a professor at Columbia and one of the resolution’s sponsors, defended the measure. “I don’t think it’s a dangerous politicization to defend the rights of academics,” he said. “That’s what we did.”",

China’s players, who lost to the Americans on penalty kicks, were faceless automatons to the network and its announcers, J. P. Dellacamera and Wendy Gebauer. But on Sunday, when the United States lost the final to Japan, ESPN did a better job of humanizing the players. Maybe it was a belated recognition that fairness produces a better broadcast. Or an acknowledgment of the suffering of Japan since the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear catastrophe in March. Whatever the reason, it was refreshing to hear the announcers Ian Darke and Julie Foudy play it nearly down the middle, offering praise for the Japanese players and providing personal tidbits about them, as if they were, well, American. Of course, balanced coverage or not, a game’s excitement is the reason people watch. Japan’s victory was watched by an average of 13.5 million viewers, the most ever for a women’s or men’s soccer game on ESPN. But the record for a United States game is still 17.9 million viewers for the victory by Team U.S.A. in 1999. That makes you wonder: what if Sunday’s game had been on ABC, the broadcast serf to Mother ESPN? But that’s old thinking, I guess. Still, people without cable could not watch the game live at home (although a broadband option existed on espn3.com ). Although there were moments when one could sense Darke and Foudy were rooting for the United States, they were not openly rooting (although Foudy could have dropped her references to her rising blood pressure during the team’s games). Darke’s voice was as enthusiastic for Japanese goals, and their shots on goal, as he was for the Americans’. (Readers: I do not own a decibel meter; to my ears, he was fair.) “Sawa does it!” he shouted when Japan scored its second goal. “Homare Sawa, the darling of Japan!” And the two announcers repeatedly chastised the United States team for its multiple failures to convert scoring opportunities, especially during the first half. Foudy did not resort to contorted alibis for the misses. “How important will these moments be later on?” Darke asked in the 13th minute. And not long after Darke predicted that Japan has “players who can pick the locks of any defense,” Kozue Ando slipped through for her country’s first significant scoring opportunity. Darke is a highly literate, quirky and emotional announcer. You won’t hear American announcers call an “obdurate defense,” a terrific pass a “rapier thrust” or a tying goal the “equalizer.” (Or is it “equaliser”?) But while it was easy to grasp the focus on the Japanese team’s short stature against the taller United States squad’s, Darke was condescending, evoking stereotypes, when he called one player “the tricky little Maruyama.” And one must question the logic of a comment like Foudy’s after Abby Wambach kicked a ball off the post. “She hit it as good as she can,” Foudy said, showing perhaps too much reflexive admiration for the star of the team. But if Wambach had struck the ball as well as she could, it would have gone into the net. As any announcer knows, if you speak long enough, you might say things you wish you could take back. Not words you shouldn’t say but statements of certitude that action can soon subvert. So right after Darke and Foudy praised the Americans for “not losing their gung-ho spirit” (Darke) and demonstrating a “wonderful balance of sophistication and grit,” Japan tied the score at 1-1 on the United States’ bumbling. Later, with the United States ahead, 2-1, with six minutes left in the overtime, Foudy was wondering if Japan’s patience was “working against them” as an aggressive pass to Yukari Kinga nearly led to a goal. Foudy’s faith in goalkeeper Hope Solo, who injured her knee late in the game, led her to say before the penalty kicks, “I would take an ailing Hope Solo in my net anytime.” But Solo was faked out on the first kick, and the third one deflected into the goal off her hand. And Darke’s objectivity seem to flee when, after Solo saved the second Japanese penalty kick, he boldly declared, “Hope Solo — hero again!” Premature. And wrong.",

    "source": "Belgium’s Interior Minister Visits New York Police to Discuss Terror Threats <eos> Belgium’s interior minister, who nearly resigned after the Brussels bombings by Islamic State militants more than two months ago, met with New York police officials and counterterrorism specialists on Thursday in what he described as a useful visit. The minister, Jan Jambon, who is also a deputy prime minister and overseer of Belgium’s police forces, expressed admiration for the New York Police Department’s intelligence-gathering, its technology and the bomb-sniffing dogs in its counterterrorism unit. Mr. Jambon and John J. Miller, the deputy police commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, said at a news conference that the minister’s visit was part of a growing collaboration. “In difficult times, one knows their friends,” Mr. Jambon said, drawing parallels between the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, in the United States and the March 22 bombings at the Brussels airport and subway. The Brussels attacks left 35 people dead, including three assailants, and traumatized a city that for many represents the heart of Europe. The bombs used in the assault had been assembled in Brussels. Mr. Jambon and other senior Belgian officials have been criticized for intelligence lapses that preceded the bombings, which have reinforced their country’s reputation as an incubator for Islamic State militant recruitment and attack plots in Europe. Some of the suspects in the Brussels bombings have been linked to the Paris attacks last November. Mr. Jambon and Belgium’s justice minister, Koen Geens, offered to resign after the Brussels bombings, but Prime Minister Charles Michel asked them to stay. Mr. Jambon told reporters on Thursday that improvements in intelligence-gathering and police information-sharing in Belgium, which had been in the works before the attacks, were accelerated afterward. “The attacks came too early,” he said. Mr. Jambon added, “I think we have made a lot of progress.” Belgium remains on a high level of alert for further attacks, Mr. Jambon said, but he had no specific information about any particular plots. He also said that 200 people from Belgium were believed to be fighting with the Islamic State militant group in Syria and that about 130 had returned. While many of the returnees have expressed disillusionment with the Islamic State, Mr. Jambon said, “others come back with a mission.” After the news conference, Mr. Miller escorted Mr. Jambon outside to inspect some of the department’s counterterrorism police vehicles. The minister took special interest in the 50-pound bulletproof vests worn by officers. He was also intrigued by one of the bomb-sniffing dogs, a two-year-old black Labrador retriever named Kevin. Mr. Miller said Kevin was capable of detecting vapors emitted by TATP, an explosive believed to have been used in the Brussels and Paris attacks. Vapor Wake Labradors , as the dogs are known, can detect and track traces of explosives — their “vapor wake” — up to 10 minutes after the explosives have been moved from an area. Mr. Miller said, “We deploy these dogs at all major events.”",

    "source": "Israel Plans to Build Syrian Border Fence <eos> JERUSALEM — Israel announced Sunday that it was constructing a border fence along the length of its armistice line with Syria in the Golan Heights and that it was coordinating its intelligence with the United States in light of the deteriorating security situation in Syria. In remarks at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the Syrian Army had moved away from the frontier and that jihadist forces had moved in. “Therefore, we will defend this border against both infiltration and terrorism,” Mr. Netanyahu said, adding, “I also submit to the cabinet the fact that the Syrian regime is very unstable, that the question of chemical weapons here worries us.” He said that Israel was coordinating with the United States and others “so that we might be prepared for any scenario and possibility that could arise.” Mr. Netanyahu’s announcement came as he sought to reinforce his security credentials as a strong leader ahead of national elections on Jan. 22, and as he appealed to his traditional supporters to cast their ballots for the conservative Likud-Beiteinu ticket he is leading and not be lulled by polls showing that he is favored to win. “Whoever wants me as a strong prime minister cannot have a strong prime minister while weakening me,” Mr. Netanyahu told Israel Radio in an interview broadcast Sunday. “I think there is only one way to guarantee that the right continues to govern Israel, and that is to vote for me.” Image Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday in Jerusalem, said his nation would defend the border against jihadist forces. Credit Pool photo by Uriel Sinai Political polls in recent weeks have consistently shown that Likud-Beiteinu is bleeding votes to the Jewish Home, a far-right party led by Naftalie Bennett , a dynamic newcomer to national politics who is a former Netanyahu aide, settler leader and technology entrepreneur. Mr. Netanyahu also warned of possible efforts by centrist and leftist parties to create a united bloc aimed at thwarting his chances of forming the next coalition government. Last week, in a pre-election move intended to highlight one of his government’s achievements, the prime minister toured the new security fence that runs almost the entire length of Israel’s border with Egypt. Accompanied by a group of Israeli journalists, Mr. Netanyahu noted that the barrier had sharply stemmed the flow of African migrants into Israel and had provided more protection against militant groups operating in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. Mr. Netanyahu has pledged to erect a similar barrier along the Syrian frontier, with changes to suit the topography. A section of an old and rickety border fence near the Golan Druse village of Majdal Shams has already been fortified with a steel barrier after protesters, most of them Palestinians , breached the frontier in 2011, drawing deadly fire from Israeli soldiers. Israel seized a large portion of the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau that overlooks northern Israel, from Syria in the 1967 war and later annexed it in a move that has not been internationally recognized. The cease-fire line was established in the aftermath of the 1973 conflict, and though Israel and Syria are still technically at war, it has remained mostly quiet for decades. Israel has largely stayed out of the fighting in Syria, but in recent months a number of stray Syrian mortar shells crashed into the Israeli-controlled territory as Syrian government forces battled rebels across the line. As a result, Israel fired warning shots into Syria and in one instance aimed tank fire at a Syrian artillery position. Apprehension has been mounting, with Israeli experts warning that Syria is becoming a haven for Islamic extremists. Israel says that thousands of Islamic militants have entered Syria to fight against forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, and Israeli leaders have expressed particular concern that chemical weapons and advanced weaponry like ground-to-air missiles amassed by the Assad government could fall into the hands of radical groups. As a result, Israel has been changing its military infrastructure along the frontier with Syria, planning a continuous fence and the installation of electro-optical devices and radar, and deploying some of its most highly trained troops there for the first time in more than 30 years.",

    "source": "Murder Cases Put Questionable Evidence to Test <eos> Undigested bits of mushrooms and tomatoes from Christine Morton’s last meal — a celebratory birthday dinner she had with her husband — were still in her stomach when the medical examiner performed his autopsy in 1986. Those remnants, the prosecutor told the jury during Michael Morton’s trial, “scientifically proved” that Mr. Morton had beaten his wife to death. Twenty-five years later, DNA science revealed that someone else had actually killed Mrs. Morton and that her husband’s murder conviction and more than two decades in prison were a tragic mistake. His exoneration based on DNA evidence is the 45th in Texas. Before he dismissed the wrongful murder charges against Mr. Morton last week, Judge Sid Harle recounted the faults the case exposed in the Texas justice system. Among them: the use of so-called junk science in the courtroom. “The courts and the sitting judges need to be ever mindful about their role as gatekeeper in regard to the admission of science,” Mr. Harle said. “Your case illustrates the best and the worst of what can happen.” Despite scientific advancements like DNA testing, the use of unreliable scientific techniques in the criminal justice system persists. While some judges say they work to ensure only reliable scientific evidence is presented to juries, criminal justice advocates say that more must be done to root out an array of pseudoscientific practices that can have life-or-death consequences. “What passes for science in courtrooms is not always, in fact, science,” said Kathryn Kase, interim executive director of the Texas Defender Service, which represents death row inmates. In recent weeks, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has agreed to review cases that indicate it may also see a need to address the types of evidence that meet scientific standards. In November, the state’s highest criminal court agreed to review the case of Megan Winfrey, who is serving a life sentence for murder. She was convicted largely on the testimony of a sheriff’s deputy who said his bloodhounds “alerted” to her scent on the murder victim’s clothing. The court has previously ruled that dog-scent evidence, used to convict Ms. Winfrey’s father for the same murder, was insufficient without corroborating evidence. The court acquitted her father on appeal. This month, the court also agreed to review the cases of two men awaiting execution. Both men, convicted of murder, were sentenced to death after a psychologist who was an expert witness in several death penalty cases told jurors that they were mentally competent to face execution. Lawyers for the men — Steven Butler and John Matamoros — argue they are mentally handicapped and therefore ineligible for the death penalty. In April, the Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists reprimanded the psychologist, Dr. George Denkowski, and he agreed to never again conduct evaluations in criminal cases. Though Ms. Kase said the court’s willingness to review the cases is a hopeful sign, she and other criminal justice advocates said other relatively simple changes could help prevent the use of such evidence. Judges, who ultimately decide what is allowed in court, should approve adequate money for indigent defendants to hire experts to refute scientific experts whom prosecutors present at trial, she said. It can cost thousands of dollars to hire experts, and Patrick McCann, a Houston defense lawyer, said judges worry that voters would not take kindly to such expenses. “They act as if funding each defendant’s efforts to have a fair trial comes out of their own children’s pockets somehow,” Mr. McCann said. In recent years, Jeff Blackburn, chief counsel at the Innocence Project of Texas, has pushed to ban evidence that does not conform to national scientific standards. He will try again in 2013 when lawmakers reconvene. “These are problems that can be fairly easily solved,” he said. Senator Rodney Ellis, Democrat of Houston, said another key solution already exists: the Texas Forensic Science Commission. For more than two years, the commission was bogged down in a national political controversy over its investigation of arson science used to convict and execute Cameron Todd Willingham for a 1991 fire that killed his three daughters. That issue was resolved this year with a plan to review past arson cases to see whether similar faulty evidence led to questionable convictions. Now, Mr. Ellis said, he hopes the commission will address other questions of courtroom science. “To have a justice system we can have faith convicts the guilty and protects the innocent, we need scientific evidence that’s based on real science,” Mr. Ellis said, “not some guy saying he has magic dogs that can solve crimes.”",

    "source": "Mubarak’s Fall Prompts Double Takes - The TV Watch <eos> It took 18 days to shake the world, but this time the revolution was shown live. People around the globe watched Egyptians rise up in an unarmed insurrection. They looked on, gobsmacked, as the Mubarak dictatorship crumbled on camera. Even the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 didn’t quite have the same hypnotic pull and roller-coaster suspense — this was a long vigil that carried a constant threat of mass violence in high definition. And when the end came on Friday, it was peaceful and so abrupt that American television put on its own kind of five-second delay. All the cable news channels were focused on Cairo from early morning; broadcast networks interrupted their regular programming to go live to Cairo when the news hit. But it wasn’t until the crowds on the streets of the city went berserk that viewers could be sure that they had heard right. CNN’s instantaneous translator was so stunned as he took in Vice President Omar Suleiman’s words that he faltered and repeated President Hosni Mubarak’s name three times . Some anchors seemed uncertain about what had just happened. A puzzled Richard Lui of MSNBC turned to the correspondent Richard Engel in Cairo and asked him what he could “glean” from Mr. Suleiman’s brief statement. Mr. Engel paused and grinned as a wave of joy rose up from Tahrir Square below him. There was no hesitation on the English-language service of Al Jazeera, which covered the uprising 24 hours a day and provided an up-close, almost personal experience of populist revolt. At times, the coverage looked less like a front-row seat to history than a video game — World of Warcraft: Anti-Mubarak Edition. Calling Mr. Suleiman’s statement “short but sweet,” the anchor Adrian Finighan said simply, “ Hosni Mubarak is gone.” Reporters and anchors on other news programs rushed in over the commotion to describe the scene and begin speculating on what would happen next. Mr. Finighan stopped talking and let the outpouring of car horns, flags and tears tell the story. It was Al Jazeera’s victory as well, of course, and that struggle was also fought live on television over the last 18 days, though more subliminally. The Mubarak government, which repeatedly tried to block the Arabic-language channel, treated Al Jazeera as an enemy that incited the protesters. Al Jazeera English seemed intent on using the upheaval in Egypt to assume the kind of authoritative role that CNN had during the 1991 Persian Gulf war. The network fought back — with impassive resistance. Throughout the crisis, its correspondents covering the protests tried to hold themselves to a strict neutrality that even CNN reporters didn’t feign. Most viewers in the United States can’t watch Al Jazeera English on television — though Link TV recently began simulcasting live programming for 12 hours a day. But lots of people are frustrated with the short attention span and distractions of American news programs. (On Thursday, when Mr. Mubarak was supposed to resign and didn’t, cable news programs were underscored with crawls about Kelsey Grammer’s divorce and Jennifer Hudson’s weight.) As they did at the height of the Iraq war, many Americans chose to watch foreign newscasts, in particular streams of BBC World News and Al Jazeera English. Sometimes, it paid off. On Thursday, when the world expected Mr. Mubarak to step down, MSNBC was so convinced of it that it kept the words “Egyptian President to Step Down” on the screen several minutes into Mr. Mubarak’s speech announcing he wasn’t leaving. Hours earlier, Al Jazeera’s correspondent in Cairo, Ayman Mohyeldin, was asked whether he thought Mr. Mubarak would indeed depart. The correspondent said he thought it was unlikely that the Egyptian dictator would relinquish power so easily. And when he turned out to be right, Mr. Mohyeldin remained poker-faced and soft-spoken as he covered the protesters’ enraged reaction. He was far less indignant than Anderson Cooper of CNN, who told Wolf Blitzer: “This is a slap in the face. This is stepping on the grave, on the blood of Egyptian people that has been spilled for more than two weeks in that square we’re looking at, Wolf.” On Friday, Mr. Finighan asked Mr. Mohyeldin, who is Egyptian-born but educated in the United States, to “stop being impartial for a moment” and share his personal feelings about the turn of events. (Mr. Mohyeldin was one of the reporters for Al Jazeera who were detained by the security forces during the protests.) He didn’t allow himself to express joy . Instead he noted that all Egyptians couldn’t help but feel some pride in what had taken place on the streets of Cairo. The closest he got to a personal expression of feeling was this: “I never thought that I would actually live to see a day like this.” It was the understatement of the day, and it said a lot.",

    "source": "Lonnie Thompson, Climate Scientist, Battles Time and Mortality <eos> COLUMBUS, Ohio — One day in 1991, high in the thin, crystalline air of the Peruvian Andes, Lonnie G. Thompson saw that the world’s largest tropical ice cap was starting to melt. It was the moment he realized that his life’s work had suddenly become a race. The discovery meant other ice caps were likely to melt, too, and the tales of past climate that they contained could disappear before scientists had a chance to learn from them. Driven by a new sense of urgency over the ensuing 20 years, he pulled off a string of achievements with few parallels in modern science. He led teams to some of the highest, most remote reaches of the earth to retrieve samples of the endangered ice. Then last October, the race against the clock became much more personal. Dr. Thompson woke up in a Columbus hospital room, a strange dream rattling in his brain. He looked down. “Wires were coming out of my chest,” he said. Machinery had been implanted to keep him alive. Longer term, doctors told him, only a heart transplant would restore him to full health. Dr. Thompson, 64, is one of the most prominent of the generation of scientists who, in the latter decades of the 20th century, essentially discovered the problem of global warming . Now those scientists are beginning to age out of the field. Many of them say they grapple with the question of how hard to keep pushing themselves. Could one more finding or one more expedition help turn the tide of public awareness? Some have continued working into their 70s and 80s. One of the most vocal about the need for action, Stephen H. Schneider of Stanford University , fought off a rare form of cancer several years ago, only to die of a blood clot in 2010 after speaking in Europe about climate change. He was 65. Of this pioneering group, few were hardier than Dr. Thompson, who has taught earth sciences at Ohio State University since the 1970s. Though he routinely spent up to two months a year camped in dangerous conditions atop mountains, he despised derring-do. His enterprise was driven by a lust for hard data. Hauling six tons of equipment to South America , Africa , Asia and Europe, he and his small team raced to recover long cylinders of ice from glaciers that had built up over thousands of years. The layers in those cylinders contained dust, volcanic ash, subtle variations in water chemistry, even the occasional frozen insect — a record of climatic and geologic changes that could be retrieved, preserved and interpreted like a series of tree rings. Dr. Thompson became one of the first scientists to witness and record a broad global melting of land ice. And his ice cores proved that this sudden, coordinated melting had no parallel, at least not in the last several thousand years. To some climate scientists, the Thompson ice core record became the most convincing piece of evidence that the rapid planetary warming now going on was a result of a rise in greenhouse gases caused by human activity. “The reason Lonnie’s stuff is so powerful is that it’s so simple,” said Daniel P. Schrag, a geochemist at Harvard and director of its Center for the Environment. “His evidence dismisses the idea that this is some sort of 300-year or 500-year cycle, which is what the skeptics and the deniers want to say. You say: ‘No, because Lonnie’s ice didn’t melt then. It’s melting now, but it didn’t melt then.’ ” Colleagues say Dr. Thompson neglected his own health in pursuit of his science. Now, largely confined to his office and home in Columbus, he said he has begun to appreciate the clarity afforded him by his circumstance. “I wouldn’t wish it on anyone, but it’s not all bad,” he said. “It really forces you to sit down and think about what it is you’re doing and why you’re doing it, and how you are using your time.” Drawn to the Tropics Raised on a farm near Gassaway, W.Va., Lonnie Gene Thompson arrived at Ohio State with the idea of becoming a coal geologist, but ice soon seduced him. As a graduate student pursuing a doctorate in geology, he was put to work analyzing dust in ice cores retrieved from Antarctica , and he learned how minute chemical and physical features could be used to deduce past climate. He had recently married a fellow student, Ellen Mosley, who was drawn into Antarctic field work and became a leading Ohio State researcher in her own right. Collaborating with John Mercer, an earth scientist at the university known for his studies of glacial geology in Latin America, Lonnie Thompson was drawn to tropical ice. The very idea of ice in the warmest part of the world seems to defy common sense. But it is cold atop high mountains everywhere, and major ice caps exist on towering mountain plateaus far from the earth’s poles. Even in the mid-20th century, some of them had never been explored. The Ohio State team decided to focus on the mighty Quelccaya ice cap in the Andes of Peru , the largest tropical ice cap on the planet, suspecting it might yield a climate record. But the idea of drilling there met a chilly reception from some of the most eminent climate scientists of the day. The prevailing notion in the 1970s was that the tropics were climatologically boring and that most of the big oscillations in the earth’s climate had happened nearer the poles. Besides, in the tropics, “nobody thought there would be ice that would be very old,” recalled Wallace S. Broecker of Columbia University , then and now the leading American paleoclimatologist (At 80, Dr. Broecker is among the climate scientists still working long past retirement age). In 1974, with $7,000 from the National Science Foundation , Dr. Mercer and Dr. Thompson led a scouting party to Quelccaya, on a volcanic plain 18,000 feet above sea level. They confirmed that annual layering caused partly by seasonal dust could be seen in the ice. After a series of frustrated attempts to drill through the ice, including one involving a helicopter, Dr. Thompson resorted to mules, horses and donkeys to mount a 1983 expedition that drilled through 537 feet of ice with a solar-powered drill. At the time, he could not find a way to get the ice home frozen, so the layers were teased apart on the mountain and melted into thousands of plastic bottles that were hauled back to Columbus for chemical analysis. The results were startling. The ice record stretched back 1,500 years, and it recorded huge oscillations in the climate of the region — intense dry spells alternating with wet spells. Vast lakes had come and gone in the valleys, the dust from their dried-up beds leaving chemical imprints in the ice. The record also showed changes in water chemistry similar to those seen at the poles, leading Dr. Thompson to infer major temperature swings in the tropics. In the next few years, Dr. Thompson drilled at other sites in South America, recovering ice as old as 25,000 years and confirming the patterns seen at Quelccaya. His results, along with records other scientists were gathering from the sea floor, roiled the field of paleoclimatology. A realization began to dawn that the tropics were important to global climates of the past. It had been clear since the 1970s that the ice ages were caused by wobbles in Earth ’s orbit around the Sun, but the ice sheets mainly grew in the Northern Hemisphere, which has most of the world’s land. Scientists had evidence that the ice sheets influenced climate all over the planet, but they had had trouble figuring out how. Dr. Thompson’s results became part of a growing body of science suggesting that signals were being transmitted from the North Pole to the South Pole via the tropics, through huge shifts in winds, rain patterns and other variables. The work had implications in other fields, too. Some archaeologists had begun to think climate swings were responsible for the rise and fall of cultures in the Andes and along the Peruvian coastal plain. And Dr. Thompson’s ice cores gave them evidence that climate had indeed changed drastically enough to send entire civilizations into collapse. A Series of Challenges By the late 1980s, concern about global warming was rising, and some scientists believed the ice caps and glaciers of the tropics would be among the first to show the effects. On a return trip to Quelccaya in 1991, Dr. Thompson noticed substantial melting at the edges of the ice cap, and some on top. Laboratory tests confirmed that the annual climate signals recorded in the chemistry of the ice were being blurred. He picked up the pace with his team, who were among the first Western scientists allowed onto the ice caps of highland China , retrieving ice that may be as old as 750,000 years. He drilled several other times on the Tibetan plateau, in the Russian Arctic , in Alaska , atop Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania , in New Guinea, in the Alps. In his book about Dr. Thompson, “ Thin Ice ,” published in 2005, Mark Bowen described an incident on a peak called Huascarán in Peru. Dr. Thompson’s tent collapsed and started blowing off the mountain with him inside; he managed to stop it only by driving an ice ax through the floor, and then waited out the night. In his travels, he forded flooding rivers on horseback and coped with altitude sickness , coughing fits and blinding headaches. His West Virginia farm upbringing came in handy as he challenged Mongol porters to contests shooting wild game. Other times, he went hungry. Once, in China, dinner was a bowl of stewed camel paws. Somehow he and his team got the ice they were after and found ways to haul tons of the frozen cylinders back to Columbus, where roughly four miles of ice cores are kept at 30 degrees below zero and protected by backup generators. Dr. Thompson’s career has not been entirely free of controversy. During an expedition to Tibet in 1997, a graduate student working with him, Shawn Wight , was forced off the mountain by altitude sickness, got an infection while hospitalized and died. A judge found Ohio State not liable, but the case led universities across the country to re-examine their policies on field expeditions. Some scientists have challenged Dr. Thompson’s analysis of the signals in his ice cores, saying that the chemical changes he interprets as temperature swings probably reflect a more complicated mix of changes in temperature, precipitation and atmospheric circulation patterns. Mathias Vuille, an atmospheric scientist at the State University at Albany , who admires Dr. Thompson’s achievements, said that his analysis on this point “is hard to reconcile with other evidence.” And an especially intense controversy has erupted about Dr. Thompson’s interpretation of ice he recovered atop Mount Kilimanjaro. Though Dr. Thompson sees the rapid disappearance of ice there as a reflection of climate change, his critics cite more regional than global factors, like precipitation. While Dr. Thompson has defended his interpretations on these points, he does have some regrets. One is that those years of frenzied drilling led him to fall behind in publishing his data, so some of the evidence he has gathered is not yet available to the broader scientific community. Still, it is clear that Dr. Thompson managed to retrieve ice cores from a half-dozen places in the world where they can no longer be found in pristine form today. Some of the ice he drilled on Kilimanjaro, for instance, has since disappeared entirely. Ellen Mosley-Thompson does most of her fieldwork in Antarctica, but she has played a major role in interpreting the ice her husband recovered. Both are convinced that their own analysis is merely a start, and they have put money they have won from scientific prizes into an endowment to preserve the ice cores for future generations. ‘It’s Not Your Time ’ As a young man, Dr. Thompson stayed in shape by training for and running marathons. He now realizes his health began a slow decline sometime in his 40s. Dr. Bowen, a physicist and mountain climber, accompanied Dr. Thompson on several expeditions to write the definitive book about him. He said that atop Mount Kilimanjaro, “my heart went out to Lonnie as I lay in my tent at 20,000 feet and listened to him just hack away, coughing his lungs out. It happened almost every night for four weeks, yet we were all amazed when he got up during the day and was still as productive as four normal people.” Fifteen years ago, Dr. Thompson was treated for asthma , but he now suspects that the diagnosis was incomplete. He learned in 2009 that he had congestive heart failure , but kept to a schedule of expeditions to New Guinea and the Alps. For a time, “he was in complete denial,” his wife said. His doctors cannot say for certain that his work contributed to his health problems. Dr. Thompson notes that he has a family history of heart disease. Last fall, he reached a point where he could barely walk. He wound up in the hospital, drifting in and out of consciousness for days as his failing heart struggled to keep him alive. More than once, his wife and their daughter, Regina, were told he might not survive the night. It was deep in one of his comatose periods, he figures, that he had the dream. He described jumping through space and landing in a beautiful spot filled with flowers and streams. There, he said, a figure in white spoke to him. “It’s not your time,”’ the figure told him. “You have another purpose.” Dr. Thompson is not a particularly religious man, and he does not try to explain the dream, but his memory of it is vivid. The battery-powered equipment doctors implanted in his chest helped him get better and leave the hospital as he waited on the organ list. By the spring, he had resumed a limited work schedule, cranking out papers with colleagues around the world. He was at his desk on May 1 when the phone rang. He walked next door to his wife’s office. “My heart is here,” he told her. He underwent the transplant that evening. The donor’s family most likely does not know that the decision they made saved the life of a world-famous scientist. He is writing a letter in hopes of thanking them some day. Back in his office in early June, after the transplant, his face glowed a healthy pink. “I feel better than I have in 20 years,” he said. Dr. Thompson knows he needs to go slowly, but he has already started eyeing an unexplored ice cap in China. One of the greatest achievements of modern climate science was the recovery of ice cores in Antarctica that allowed a detailed reconstruction of the earth’s climate for the past 800,000 years. Dr. Thompson suspects an even longer record could be recovered by drilling at the right spot in Tibet. Last year, he pulled strings in Russia and asked for an astronaut on the International Space Station to photograph a certain ice cap. A Chinese scouting party has already checked it out, and drilling a core seems possible, if he regains his strength. Other people could probably do it without him, but that is not a thought he cares to entertain. “I’m going back,” he said with a wide grin. “I’m looking for the oldest ice on the planet.”",

Stalls, trailers and cars become semi-permanent residences for the tree sellers in the weeks preceding Christmas. Some vendors cross state lines — and even national borders — for a monthlong adventure away from home. Others are simply continuing a family tradition, selling Fraser and Douglas firs and other natural holiday decorations. It’s a solitary profession. Warmth and bathroom breaks become a luxury, with music and the radio often offering the only companionship. But no matter the location or circumstance, many tree sellers display a quiet dedication to their holiday vocation, approaching it with patience through rush-hour throngs or the lull of night.",

    "source": "Nets’ Brooklyn Lineup Is Full of Uncertainty <eos> EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Four players and Coach Avery Johnson gave their parting words as members of the New Jersey Nets on Friday afternoon. Although the team will continue to practice a stone’s throw from the Meadowlands in the near future, they will be doing so as the Brooklyn Nets. It remains to be seen if Deron Williams, Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace and Brook Lopez will be Brooklyn Nets when next season begins. “I don’t want to think about playing our first game in Brooklyn without Deron or without Gerald Green or Gerald Wallace or any of those guys,” Johnson said. Of the four, only Lopez, who spent much of the season injured and hearing trade rumors, explicitly pledged his desire to stay with the team. “I love being a Net,” he said. “It’s the only thing I know.” But there were moments when Williams, the team’s star player, provided Nets fans a modicum of hope. “It would be great to be a part of that first game, that first team there, kind of start our own legacy in Brooklyn,” said Williams, who is an unrestricted free agent. “So that’s definitely enticing. That’s definitely something I think about on a regular basis.” Williams said it would be hard to make any concrete decision before the beginning of free agency on July 1. He said that he had sold his house in San Diego, and that New York City would be his home until he made a final decision. He also echoed something he has said before: that he and his family like living in the city. “I’m waiting to see what they do, too,” Williams said of his teammates and fellow free agents in flux. “LeBron, D-Wade and Chris Bosh, they signed on the same day, I think.” Williams said that he wanted to sign before the Olympics in London to avoid the risk of playing there without a guaranteed contract. He will try out for the team beginning July 6 in Las Vegas. Wallace said he would make a decision in the next week on whether to opt out of the final year on his contract. “I don’t want to play on a one-year deal,” Wallace said, saying he was hoping for a four- or five-year contract. Coming off a one-year contract, Humphries expressed interest in a multiyear deal. He has nearly tripled his scoring and rebounding numbers since his arrival in New Jersey in January 2010. “There’s not many guys who hang around the league at this point in their career and they kind of get that opportunity,” he said. Both players drew laughs discussing their relationship to New York City. “I’ve been to the city twice,” Wallace said. “And both of those were doctor’s appointments.” Humphries recounted an experience getting lost en route to a dinner in the East Village and ending up stuck in traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge. “I was like, ‘Oh, man, I’m going to Brooklyn right now,’” he said. Wallace experienced the birth of the Charlotte Bobcats and, using that as a frame of reference, said he believed the Nets would have an exciting beginning in Brooklyn. “Just the buzz and the atmosphere from the community around that was amazing,” he said of the Bobcats’ inaugural season. “And they had already had a team. Brooklyn has never had a team. I can just imagine.” This week Nets General Manager Billy King persuaded Williams and Jordan Farmar to take a tour of the team’s future home, the Barclays Center, as it nears completion.",

    "source": "UConn Wins Women’s N.C.A.A. Title <eos> NASHVILLE — His record ninth N.C.A.A. title secured, Geno Auriemma climbed a ladder Tuesday night, snipped the final strands of the net and pumped it in his fist, literally standing above everyone in women’s basketball. As Connecticut routed Notre Dame, 79-58, Auriemma and the Huskies (40-0) completed their fifth undefeated season. He now has one title more than his former nemesis, Pat Summitt of Tennessee, and only one fewer than John Wooden, whose pyramid of success brought 10 national titles to the men’s team at U.C.L.A. A school whose early mission was agriculture, UConn has come to regularly harvest basketball championships. The women’s team again shares a national title with the men, as it did in 2004. Since 1999, the Huskies men and women have made a combined 17 appearances at the Final Four. Duke is next with eight. For a night, at least, no one worried that the Huskies needed a more substantive football league than the fledgling American Athletic Conference to continue to succeed in basketball. “We’re in a league of our own,” Auriemma said earlier in the tournament. In the first matchup between undefeated teams in the women’s title game, UConn pitilessly exploited the absence of Notre Dame’s 6-foot-3-inch post player, Natalie Achonwa, who tore a knee ligament in a regional final. The Irish (37-1) had no answer for the height and interior skill of UConn’s 6-4 Breanna Stewart, the national player of the year, or 6-5 center Stefanie Dolson. Stewart finished with 21 points, 9 rebounds and 4 assists, while Dolson contributed 17 points, 16 rebounds, 7 assists and 3 blocks. Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis added 18 points and 7 rebounds. UConn took an early 22-8 lead with a 16-0 run, every point coming inside. Eventually, the Huskies scored 52 points in the lane to 22 for the Irish. “We knew we had a size advantage and could get really get the ball in the paint,” Dolson said. And while Auriemma did not say anything effusive about his ninth title, Dolson said, “It definitely means a lot to him, to have something no one else can say they have.” While Auriemma can be blunt and polarizing — a columnist at The Tennessean newspaper suggested he was at times the “arrogant, egomaniacal, unbeatable coach everybody in women’s basketball hates” — his teams are built on selfless discipline. Image UConn’s Moriah Jefferson and Notre Dame’s Kayla McBride battling for a loose ball in the first final featuring unbeaten teams. Credit John Bazemore/Associated Press The Huskies won Tuesday as they have since their first title in 1995. With an attacking offense built on movement, screens and crisp passing. And a defense that never loses its intent to hound and confuse and disrupt. Most impressively, the Huskies bewilder opponents while seldom committing fouls. Notre Dame, the nation’s No. 1 shooting team, hit only 22 of 62 attempts (35.5 percent) against relentless UConn. If repeat victory for UConn — this was a second consecutive title — has stirred both appreciation and resentment from others, so be it, Dolson said. “We know no one wants to see us win, so we’re going to win anyway,” she said. Jeff Judkins, the women’s coach at Brigham Young, and a former men’s assistant at Utah, noted that he had coached against Bobby Knight, Rick Pitino and John Calipari and that Auriemma deserved the comparison. The truest association might be to Mike Krzyzewski of Duke, who like Auriemma, has ornamented his college abundance with Olympic gold. “Geno, in my book, is one of the best coaches ever, when you dominate a sport like he has,” Judkins said. Repeatedly, Auriemma, 60, has been asked why he never left to coach a men’s team. For starters, he makes about $2 million a year at UConn. And he is able to recruit many of the country’s best players to an isolated campus. “It’s like we were going for a race and you’re driving a Porsche and I’m driving a truck,” Judkins said. “You’ve got a better chance of winning.” Women stay in school for four years instead of departing after one, like many men’s players. And after overseeing his son’s A.A.U. team, Auriemma decided that women were more coachable than men. “A lot of things have happened to make me think I’ve got a pretty good job where I am,” he said. Many celebrate UConn’s 2002 championship team of Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi and Swin Cash as the greatest in women’s basketball. Others prefer Maya Moore’s teams that built a 90-game winning streak to the current Huskies team, which lacked depth. But Gary Blair, who coached Texas A&M to the 2011 national title, considers this to be Auriemma’s best starting five. His reasons: Stewart is the most versatile player in the country. Dolson is as resourceful as Tina Charles was. Point guard Moriah Jefferson willingly restricts her focus to assists and steals. Shooting guard Bria Hartley has a flair for the timely basket. Image Center Stefanie Dolson had 17 points, 16 rebounds and 7 assists for UConn, which took an early 22-8 lead and outscored Notre Dame, 52-22, in the lane. Credit Ben Solomon for The New York Times Of the feathery 3-pointers of Mosqueda-Lewis, Blair said, “Who’s a better shooter that they’ve ever had? If you want to play a game of H-O-R-S-E, I’m taking Lewis over any of his great ones.” When Mosqueda-Lewis missed eight games during the season with an elbow injury and mononucleosis, Auriemma told her, “Don’t feel sorry for yourself. Nobody else is going to feel sorry for you.” This directness can be traced, in part, to two sources. First, Auriemma grew up outside Philadelphia, where what is pronounced as “attytude” is a fine and necessary art. Second, Auriemma said, his parents, who immigrated from Italy when he was 7, trusted coddling less than they trusted banks. He described the family approach as “I’m not worried about your feelings. I’m just going to tell you the truth. What are you going to do, run away from home?” In demanding greatness, he views himself as a kind of personal trainer, pushing his players beyond the limits they set for themselves. It was disrespectful, Auriemma said, to treat his team as female basketball players instead of simply as basketball players. Nora Lynn Finch, the associate commissioner for women’s basketball in the Atlantic Coast Conference, said, “I think there are not enough coaches who set the standard and will not lower the bar.” Summitt set the same uncompromising standard at Tennessee. And while she and Auriemma feuded, and she eventually stopped scheduling UConn over concerns about the recruiting of Moore, Summitt also kept her sense of humor. When two goldfish in her office fish tank tried to devour each other, she named them Pat and Geno. Now that Summitt’s career has been ended by early-onset Alzheimer’s, respect and belated friendship have superseded bickering. Auriemma said he would take no added pleasure in winning a ninth championship in the state where Summitt built her dynasty. “At some point,” he said, “you just stop and go, O.K., what’s the point?” Similarly, he demurred when asked about title comparisons to Wooden. He laughed and said there were no men’s coaches telling anyone, “If I win 8 or 9, I’ll catch Geno Auriemma.” What he was most proud of, said Auriemma, who came to UConn in 1985, was the sustained excellence of his teams. “Every coach,” he said, “wants their legacy to be, I was really good at what I did for a really long time.”",

    "source": "Greenburgh Students in a Finance Class Talk of Money Changes at Home <eos> GREENBURGH FOR the most part, they are shielded, their parents seldom letting on what is really going on. But trouble has an insidious way of making itself known, and 11- and 12-year-olds in the Town of Greenburgh seem to have slowly come to realize that the American economy is dreadfully sick. Jasmine Bradwell, 11, whose exuberance is crowned by a ready laugh, knew something was wrong when she visited Costco two weeks before Halloween . “They had plenty of candy,” she said. “Last year they were out.” Her assessment that people are not buying as much candy may be less than authoritative because she was in Costco before the season’s peak, but Jasmine has also seen how many stores are seductively trumpeting sales and she worries that people have become gun-shy about shopping. Christmas and her birthday are coming up, and perhaps she won’t get as generous presents as in the past. Lordess Turner, 11, was recently selling chocolates to raise money for her school and, she recalled, “People said they couldn’t pay for it.” “The stock market is going down, and they don’t get as much pay as they used to,” she said. Jasmine and Lordess were among a dozen children, most of them sixth and seventh graders in Greenburgh’s schools, who sat around a table at the Theodore D. Young Community Center chatting about the economy. They are part of an after-school practical-business program that Greenburgh is running under a $335,000 contract with a nonprofit firm, the Xposure Foundation. The students will learn the mechanics of applying for jobs and good etiquette and habits at work. They will also receive $12 a week to save or invest as they see fit. Some money may wind up in partial shares in the stock market, so the students could soon learn about the maddening capriciousness of that beast. The students, for the most part, don’t watch news programs or read The Wall Street Journal regularly, but the bad news is out there in the ether — in remarks dropped at the dinner table, in stray comments from relatives, in sudden moves friends make because a house has been foreclosed on. Some end up worrying and wondering, even if their parents try to cheer them up. Giovanni Sanchez, 12, learned that an uncle had been fired. Keyonah Bratton, 11, learned the same about a cousin of hers. Awa Nyambi, 11, a slight, bright-eyed young man, has a mother who works at a hard-hit travel company in White Plains. “Mom was talking about the stock dropping and how they may have to let go of some people, people who work on her team,” he said. “They don’t have all the money to afford to keep them on the team.” Adriana Bailey’s father works for the New York Stock Exchange, though, like many other 12-year-olds, she doesn’t know precisely what her father does. “Lots of people at his job are getting fired, and he’s afraid he’ll be in the next round,” she said. Her eyes glimmered, and she looked palpably upset and a little confused. “He used to buy a lot of stuff, jewelry and laptops,” she said. “He has to stop buying it.” For one thing, these children are clearly sensing the desperate maneuvers of high finance and the United States Treasury. “Popular banks like Chase are taking over little banks,” Jasmine said. “People are losing their bank accounts. My mom changed to Chase. Before she had her money in HSBC.” In many ways, they know their parents’ days of wine and roses are over — at least for a while. Ciarra Williams, 12, has a friend who had to move back with her father after her mother lost her home. “A lot of people are losing their houses because of the high mortgage, and it’s causing poverty,” she said. “My mom’s friend, their house is about to go into foreclosure because she couldn’t pay,” Jasmine chimed in. “It was a nice house too.” Teara Williams, 12, Ciarra’s twin sister, noticed how her school was trying fund-raising gimmicks like talent shows so it could afford to maintain the school and buy supplies. And the students are mad at the way grown-ups have frittered away money, even as our new Gilded Age has been turning to dross. Jasmine wondered what was the need of a new Yankee Stadium when the old one did the job perfectly well. “I could see if something was wrong with the building, but who needs a new stadium?” she said. That sparked an echo of outrage from Ciarra. “They’re going through a depression and they think about a stadium?” she asked. “It makes no difference whether it’s old or new.” Their sense of the nation’s financial meltdown is already influencing their plans for what they will do with the money they earn. They’re thinking of investing in stocks that rely on what people always do, good times and bad. People have to eat even if a depression hits. So McDonald’s was a stock the students touted. “I’m going to invest in Apple,” Jasmine said. “They make a lot of money — iPods, iPhones, computers. People like that stuff.” That brought a chuckle from Raymond L. Thomas Jr., Xposure’s executive director. “It’s always the kids who know when the next big thing is,” he said. But Jasmine quickly confessed to some second thoughts about her money. “I’ll put it in savings,” she decided. “Because the way the stocks are going. I’m going to lose.”",

    "source": "Hunter Mahan Struggles to Find Balance and a Missing Swing <eos> DUBLIN, Ohio — Hunter Mahan had two shafts at his feet for alignment. His coach was at his side for one shot, stood behind him on the next, and then crouched to block the glare of the hot sun to study the video. At one point, Mahan dropped his club after an errant shot, and Sean Foley, the coach, moved in for more instruction. These are the unhappy signs of a player in search of his game. “There is no joy in playing bad,” Mahan said. Mahan, reflective and honest, said last week that he was thankful for a life he described as incredible because he has rarely experienced stress on or off the golf course. He is approaching $30 million in career earnings despite having had to return to qualifying school once early in his P.G.A. Tour career. Each year he got a little better. He has played in every major since the 2007 United States Open at Oakmont. All that has changed. Once as high as No. 4 in the world, Mahan checked in last week at No. 143. “I haven’t had many struggles in my life,” Mahan said. “This is foreign territory to me.” Mahan is not currently eligible for any more majors. And he was not aware that the top players had been invited to be fitted for Ryder Cup uniforms on Tuesday at Muirfield Village, though for a man who has played on seven United States teams, the Ryder Cup was the least of his concerns. “The hard part is showing up every day with a good attitude, because the bad stuff is with you,” he said. “When you’re playing good, the bad stuff goes away. It’s like you’re waterproof. And when you’re playing bad, it feels like you’re a sponge.” Do not get the idea that Mahan, 34, was sulking. He said life off the course had never been better. In some respects, life off the course is part of why he is struggling, though Mahan would not change that. His first child, Zoe, was born in 2013 during the Canadian Open, where Mahan held a two-shot lead but withdrew and raced home to Dallas to be with his wife, Kandi, in time for the birth. His second child, Miller, was born about 18 months later. “We wanted them close together. We had two and it was like, ‘Holy moly, two is a lot.’ And then she was pregnant,” Mahan said with a smile. His third child is due next month. “I was kind of looking forward to a year without anything new, which hasn’t happened. Everything in my life is really good. I’m just not shooting the scores I should.” Soon, the couple will have three children under the age of 3. “We have a lot going on,” Mahan said. “Mentally, you’d like to deal with one thing at a time. I think it overwhelmed me, and I lost track of my swing a little bit. It feels like an avalanche, but it’s just a snow flurry.” Mahan has felt the pull to be at home with two toddlers and a pregnant wife, and that is where he has felt his energy should be. And so it has been difficult for him to devote his previous intensity his game, which had been so reliable that he was the only player to have never missed a FedEx Cup playoff event since its inception in 2007 — until he failed to reach the Tour Championship last year. Mahan said he was not sure what would be harder to find: his swing or the right balance in life. “I’m a father and a husband, and I have to be there first,” he said. “It’s hard to be there mentally in both places.” It shows. This year, he has missed the cut seven times in 13 starts. His best finish was a tie for 43rd at Torrey Pines, his first event of the year. He did not break 70 until the second round of the Players Championship, a stretch of 34 straight rounds at 70 or higher. Mahan was confident that his work and his game were going in the right direction. As far away as he appears on paper, he said he did not feel the gap was too large. “I’m not trying to get back to where I’m a top-50 player,” he said. “I’m trying to get back to where I’m a top-five or top-10 player. “I’m making headway. I’m doing the right things. It’s just going to take time, and time moves slow,” he continued. “It moves fast when you’re playing good. When you’re playing bad, every hole takes forever, and every round takes forever. You think a 65 will fix everything, and it won’t.”",

    "source": "Château Latour Breaks With a Bordeaux Tradition <eos> PAUILLAC, France — As they have every April for decades, wine merchants from around the world donned their tweed jackets, tucked in their pocket squares and descended on Bordeaux this week to assess the latest vintage. In visits to revered chateaus in localities like Pomerol, Margaux and Saint-Estèphe, they swirled, sniffed, spat and scored the 2012 Bordeaux. But this year one of the biggest names, Château Latour, will not be available when the other 2012 wines go on sale in the coming weeks. Anyone who wants the 2012 Latour will have to wait years, thanks to a decision by the chateau’s owner, the French billionaire François Pinault, to withhold the wine from the annual sale of Bordeaux futures . The move reflects broader trends that are shaking up the clubby wine industry of Bordeaux, the largest producer of high-quality wines in the world, and stirring tensions between the people who produce the wine and those who sell it to affluent clients across the globe. Each side accuses the other of greed; hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake. “If you do anything that goes against what’s been traditionally done in Bordeaux, it’s controversial,” said Stephen Browett, chairman of Farr Vintners, a wine merchant in Britain that specializes in Bordeaux. “When it’s one of the richest men in France that is thinking outside the box, it’s doubly controversial.” Mr. Pinault is used to getting his way. For more than two years he battled his main rival in the French luxury goods business — Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton — for control of the fashion house Gucci, eventually prevailing in 2001. Other holdings, via companies his family controls, include Yves Saint Laurent, the auction house Christie’s and the Palazzo Grassi in Venice. Mr. Pinault has owned Château Latour for two decades. But that still makes him a relative newcomer to Bordeaux, where the old money frowns on the ostentatious tastes of men like Mr. Pinault and his son, François-Henri, who now runs the family holding company, Artemis, and who is married to the actress Salma Hayek. For as long as anyone here can remember — at least three centuries, some say — the high-end wines of the region have been sold via local intermediaries, called négociants, rather than directly by the chateaus. The négociants sell the wine to merchants, distributors and importers in the spring after the harvest, while the wine is still in barrels, through a futures market called en primeur. Elsewhere, wine producers generally sell directly to distributors, importers or private clients, without the added layer of négociants. Many chateau owners and négociants say the system benefits both sides. Chateaus get the upfront revenue they need to invest in the production of the next vintage. The négociants whip up interest in the new vintage, and their marketing prowess has helped Bordeaux beat its rivals into new markets like China, now the biggest importer of the region’s wines. Image The quaint French village of Saint-Emilion. Credit Nicolas Tucat/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images In return, the middlemen get up to 15 percent of the wholesale price of the wine — not bad when a bottle of Château Latour sells for around 300 euros (nearly $400) in a mediocre vintage, much more in a great one. “The négociant system has survived the Revolution, two world wars, the Great Depression and phylloxera,” said Patrick Bernard, who runs one of the biggest firms, Millésima, referring to the insect pest that ravaged the vineyards of Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. “The economy of Bordeaux is based on en primeur. If you break this, you break the Bordeaux wine economy.” But chateau owners complain that they have not been getting their fair share of the gains from a recent surge in global demand for high-end Bordeaux. In vintages like 2005 and 2008, the price of many wines doubled or tripled after the initial sales, and much of the profit went to wine merchants and other customers, not the chateaus. More and more chateaus have been sold by longtime family owners to corporations or to tycoons like Mr. Pinault, whose family has an estimated worth of $15 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Mr. Arnault, for example, has snapped up two other famed Bordeaux properties, Cheval Blanc and d’Yquem. Proprietors with such deep pockets do not need to worry about how to pay for the corks, bottles and labels for the next year’s wine, so they can do without the revenue from the early sales. While a few chateaus had previously pulled out of the traditional system, the move by Château Latour, announced last year but effective with the current vintage, was the most direct attack yet. Latour, one of the five so-called first growths of Bordeaux — the top wines in an official classification that dates back to 1855 — is coveted like few other wines. Château Latour said that instead of selling early, it would keep vintages until it deemed them ready to drink, and price them accordingly. Over the winter, it followed up by announcing that instead of providing the 2012 vintage for sale this spring, it would offer remaining bottles of the 1995 Latour. Frédéric Engerer, the director of Château Latour, says his complaint is not about the intermediaries — the ‘95 Latour is being sold through them — or about money. The problem, he says, is that the system encourages people to drink Latour, which benefits from a decade or two of aging, too early. After buying in the futures market, customers take delivery of the wines as soon as they are bottled, usually about a year and a half later, making it tempting to pop a cork or two before the wine is ready. Furthermore, many bottles of Latour have been changing hands often as speculators seek to make a quick profit, so the wine may not be stored in optimal conditions. In some other wine regions, like Champagne, Mr. Engerer noted, producers keep the wine in their cellars until it is mature — so why not Bordeaux? Image Winemakers open their 2012 bottles for tasting by 6,000 wine merchants who gather at this time each year. Credit Jean-Pierre Muller/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images “We want to provide our wines to our customers at the best moment and with best possible quality,” he said in an e-mail. “This makes all the more sense for Latour, which is one of the longest-aging wines of Bordeaux.” His argument, however, did not go down well with Mr. Bernard of Millésima. Last month, as the tasting season approached, Millésima announced that it would no longer sell Château Latour, leaving a void in his portfolio alongside the other first growths — Margaux, Haut-Brion, Lafite Rothschild and Mouton-Rothschild. Several other négociants followed suit, though most have tried to keep their heads down. Mr. Bernard says the real problem is that chateau owners have become unrealistic in their pricing expectations since the 2009 vintage, widely hailed as one of the best ever. The 2009s sold well, even though some chateaus tripled or quadrupled their prices. But subsequent vintages have drawn less interest. Now Mr. Bernard — and he is not alone — is urging chateau owners to cut prices sharply for the 2012 wines. In 2011, the first growths were released at an average wholesale price of 350 euros a bottle during early sales — down from 500 euros for 2010 and 450 euros for 2009, but still up sharply from 100 euros for the 2008. Even the Chinese, eager buyers of the 2009 vintage, mostly said no thanks. Mr. Bernard says a price of less than 200 euros would be appropriate for the 2012 wines, given the uneven quality of the vintage and the uncertainties in the global economy. His view was seconded by Robert Parker, the prominent American wine critic, who wrote on Twitter: “Prices need to fall dramatically to reignite some market interest.” For chateaus, pricing Bordeaux is always a complicated game with many variables: négociants, consumers, the quality of the vintage and the economy. The ordinary laws of supply and demand do not always hold sway. Many chateau owners say the traditional system still makes sense, but all are watching closely to see how Latour fares. “People have been saying for 30 years that en primeur is dead,” said one chateau owner, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect business relationships. “It’s true that nothing you learned in business school applies here. But en primeur keeps going.”",

    "source": "The Taint of Scandal in Taiwan's Pro League <eos> TAIPEI — The latest baseball scandal to hit Taiwan has many gloomy about the future of a sport that has given the island an identity. On Monday, prosecutors opened an investigation into whether players in Taiwan’s Chinese Professional Baseball League deliberately lost games in exchange for payoffs. Former players and alleged gambling ringleaders have been detained. On Wednesday, the police questioned nine more players, eight were named as suspects, according to local media. The allegations include the play of the Brother Elephants, the island’s most popular team, as it lost the Taiwan Series to the Uni-President 7-11 Lions. The Lions won the seventh, and final, game Sunday. Taiwan’s 20-year old professional baseball league has been plagued by such corruption scandals. Gangsters have in the past intimidated players, but this time, a spokesman said, prosecutors have ruled out the possibility that players were threatened or intimidated. But league officials had been upbeat recently, saying game attendance had bounced back this season, that the government was doing more to promote the game and that the tiny league — numbering only four teams after others folded amid scandal or financial losses — was retrenching. For many Taiwanese, the stakes are far higher than a mere sport’s survival. Baseball is one of the few arenas in which Taiwan has won recognition on the world stage. “In the past, we used baseball to raise our morale and reinforce our national identity,” said Yu Jun-wei, author of a recent book on the history of baseball in Taiwan and a professor at National Taiwan Sport University in Taichung. “It still serves a political purpose. China always says we’re part of their territory. But we can use baseball to prove to ourselves and others that we still exist in international society.” Yu said the scandal was especially damaging because it involved the Brother Elephants and one of its top stars — the pitcher Tsao Chin-hui, the first Taiwanese to have played in U.S. major league baseball, for the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Colorado Rockies. Tsao was one reason attendance rose this season, his first in Taiwan’s professional league, reaching an average of 4,000 per game, double last year’s dismal showing, according to the league. Tsao maintains his innocence but said prosecutors had searched his home. Richard Wang, director of international affairs for the league, said prosecutors had searched the Brother Elephants’ dormitory Monday, seized three cellphones and detained two former baseball players. He said on Tuesday that the league had been “hurt badly” by the latest allegations. “It’s devastating, for sure,” Wang said. “If what the media said is true — that players were voluntarily cooperating with bookies — that’s really bad news.” “In the past, players were throwing games under pressure and threats from the mafia. If this time there were no threats or pressure, and it was just the players’ greed, that’s really sad.” The Japanese brought baseball to Taiwan after they colonized the island in 1895. Taiwan’s string of Little League titles in the 1970s confirmed that the game was a rare arena for the island to shine internationally. The victories were a sorely needed morale booster in a decade in which the United States broke diplomatic ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing as the legitimate government of China and Taiwan lost representation in the United Nations. Many Little League heroes went on to play in Taiwan’s first professional league, established with high hopes in 1990. Since the peak of “baseball fever” in the early 1990s, though, the game’s fortunes have waned. Attendance has plummeted, as has television viewership, especially after satellite channels brought U.S. Major League Baseball and basketball into Taiwan homes. Last year, Taiwan’s league had shrunk to four teams, down from 11 in two leagues in the late 1990s, after the dMedia T-Rex team was kicked out amid game-fixing allegations and the Chinatrust Whales folded. Worse, though, was Taiwan’s loss to China’s team at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Not only is China an obvious political rival, it also had virtually no history of baseball until very recently, compared with Taiwan’s century of play. “It was a humiliation, because we always thought our standard was much higher than China’s,” said Professor Yu. “Baseball is one of the few sports we can beat them at.” The loss sparked a round of soul-searching and government commitments to shore up the game. A second loss to China at the World Baseball Classic in March prompted the island’s then-prime minister to declare the Taiwan team’s performance “unacceptable.” According to Lance Lan, an official at the cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council who was previously involved in baseball promotion, the government has adopted a four-year, 1 billion Taiwan dollar, or $31 million, plan to help turn the sport around. “It’s to help upgrade our country’s baseball, especially at the grass roots,” he said. If the game-fixing allegations prove true, the grass roots may be the only thing left. Chris Day, a spokesman for the Chinese Taipei Baseball Association, said the Brother Elephants’ coach had publicly vowed last year to disband the team if its players were found to be involved in throwing games. “The Brother Elephants are a major team — they’re like the New York Yankees of Taiwan,” said Day. “If they close down, it’s going to be very hard for the league to sustain itself.” “This isn’t four guys sitting down and cheating at mah-jongg, it’s a matter of lying to the whole public and baseball-loving population here,” Day said. Richard Lin, secretary-general of the Chinese Taipei Baseball Association, said that better compensation and free-agent rights could also help keep players honest. He said players’ salaries averaged just 100,000 Taiwan dollars a month but should be triple that. Regardless of the scandals, though, baseball will remain Taiwan’s national pastime, Lin said, because Taiwanese baseball heroes, like the New York Yankees pitcher Wang Chien-ming, continue to inspire younger generations. Basketball may be all the rage, but few Taiwanese are physically able to compete on the level of the National Basketball Association or in international team competitions. “Taiwanese like baseball because they know we have a chance to get a championship, or at least second or third place,” Lin said. “But in basketball? Impossible.”",

    "source": "McCain Counters Romney With a Three-Way Riposte <eos> It doesn’t look much like there is a McCain-Romney ticket in the offing. Senator John McCain of Arizona, whose support of a bipartisan immigration proposal has drawn criticism from Mitt Romney , the former governor of Massachusetts, answered yesterday with a pointed riposte. “In the case of Governor Romney, you know, maybe I should wait a couple of weeks and see if it changes because it’s changed in less than a year from his position before,” Mr. McCain said on a conference call. “And maybe his solution will be to get out his small-varmint gun and drive those Guatemalans off his lawn.” That was at least three political jabs packed into one. First, Mr. McCain was painting Mr. Romney as a flip-flopper, in a nod to the fact that he has expressed support for similar immigration proposals in the past and changed his position on abortion before running for president. Next, Mr. McCain took a dig at a memorable line Mr. Romney used this year after his attempt to portray himself as a lifelong hunter was challenged, and it surfaced that he had not taken out hunting licenses in the states where he lived. “I’ve always been a rodent and rabbit hunter,” Mr. Romney said. “Small varmints, if you will.” Finally, the Guatemalans. That was a reference to an article in The Boston Globe late last year that quoted several people from Guatemala who said they had worked on Mr. Romney’s lawn in suburban Boston while in the United States illegally, as employees of a lawn care company that Mr. Romney hired. It was an early taste of one Republican presidential candidate naming, and criticizing, another. The Romney campaign answered with a statement that only referred to Mr. McCain as “a certain candidate.” “Governor Romney has been very clear that he opposes this immigration agreement, which clearly falls short of the American public’s expectations,” said Kevin Madden, a spokesman for Mr. Romney. “It seems that a certain candidate who brokered this flawed plan is having a very difficult time coming to terms with the political fallout that has ensued and has abandoned any and all substantive arguments for it.”",

    "source": "Priorities in Mexico’s Drug War <eos> The following are excerpts from an interview with Enrique Peña Nieto, a former governor of Mexico State who is the front-running candidate in the July 1 presidential election in Mexico . The interview was conducted in Spanish last week and translated by The New York Times. On priorities in the drug war : “The adjustment in the strategy is to focus on decreasing violence. And that means that the whole Mexican state, jointly between the three levels of government — state, federal and municipal — should really focus its efforts on combating homicide and the impunity that is a given in many of the homicides committed, as with kidnapping and extortion.” On improving policing, including adding a gendarmerie and expanding the federal police force to supplement small, poorly equipped local police forces. “Many times it’s there, in these places with the lowest populations, where organized crime hides, as there is no police that can really fulfill its duty to the best because the institutions are too weakened. There are too few police, sometimes without equipment, without weapons, and organized crime, with the level of sophistication in which it operates, ends up easily getting there and taking over these places with small populations.” On building trustworthy justice institutions: “Today we know of a great number of detentions, but it is not equal to the number of convictions of people that we presume committed a crime. Consequently, we have to strengthen this whole chain — we have to attain complete rule of law — and that doesn’t happen by decree, nor by good will. It’s a constant for the Mexican state, the strengthening of institutions. That will really allow us to have better results.” On the need to push through stalled money-laundering laws in congress: “I think money laundering is giving oxygen to organized crime. And what we must do is ensure that with this tool that the state will have, in the new legislation to combat money laundering, allows the state to act more efficiently.” On going after Joaquín Guzmán, known as “El Chapo,” or “Shorty,” the most-wanted drug trafficker in Mexico: “The commitment is to give security to the people. The commitment is to reduce violence, and the commitment is also to combat effectively and to capture those who act outside of the law. El Chapo and any other criminal — the state is obviously there to go after them and subject them to the law.” On the Institutional Revolutionary Party’s reputation for corruption: “I can’t single out my party. In all parties there are regrettable cases that have tarnished the institutions represented by certain actors. Therefore, it’s necessary to strengthen the state through public entities like the one I’ve proposed, the National Anticorruption Commission, to combat corruption. The state is obliged to fight corruption within the government. Today there are different mechanisms that are dedicated to this objective, but without a doubt, they aren’t sufficient. I have been proposing a national auditing system for the three levels of government, strengthening the Institute for Information and Protection of Data precisely to give more powers within these entities and municipalities to really attain more transparency and a better accountability.” On whether he has smoked marijuana or consumed any other illicit drug: “Never ever. I say it categorically. And I would undergo any test if there were any I could. I am willing to undergo any test.” On not being able to name three books that have made a mark on his life, a question that caused a social-media sensation when he could not fully answer at a book fair in December: “I wouldn’t pick one in particular. Back then, when they asked me that same question. I said, thinking which books, I pointed out the Bible as one of the first texts I read, and I think reading various books undoubtedly leaves you knowledge, lessons. I wouldn’t point out, or wouldn’t let one book in particular mark me. Maybe, more focused on my childhood, the Bible. After that it has been the forming of broader knowledge by reading many books — the ones I read during my college years, the ones during my postgraduate time and the ones I read on a regular basis.” On the movies “J. Edgar,” about the megalomaniacal FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, and “The Departed,” about Boston mobsters. “Lately the one I’ve been seeing in bits and parts is “Edgar Hoover.” Very good, by the way. ... I was drawn to it, and the truth is, well, it’s interesting. I recommend it. I’m probably halfway through. ... I also like comedies. ... Ah, “The Departed” is really good.”",

    "source": "Course Requirements: Good Nose and a Taste for Wine <eos> Stephanie Frederick’s lecture began with a toast to Robert Mondavi, the celebrated winemaker who recently died. “He was the true father of American wine, my hero,” Ms. Frederick said to her students, who sat before a map of Italy, each one peering over seven glasses of red and white wines in a room where the wafts of alcohol would give a wall-fly a contact high. Ms. Frederick lowered her glass and lifted her head. “Does anybody think they can recognize a corked wine if they were blindfolded?” she asked, taking her red wine from station to station, beneath the twitching noses of aspiring sommeliers. “I didn’t know if this wine was corked or oxidized, but that sherry nose tells me that somehow, oxygen got in that wine.” “Oxygen,” Ms. Frederick added, “is the enemy of wine.” As she spoke, all 45 students began scribbling furiously on their notepads. They had gathered for a Tuesday morning class at the Williams Club in Midtown, home of the Sommelier Society of America, which offers a 20-week course covering a variety of wines and the significant regions of the world where they are produced. Ms. Frederick had already covered southern France, Germany and Austria, and in the next weeks, two other instructors were to discuss Portugal and Spain. Edison Lopez of Sunnyside, Queens, was spending weeknights poring over his wine notes, and weekends sniffing and sipping merlots and cabernets, Burgundies and Bordeaux in preparation for the final exam on July 22. Like most of his classmates, he hopes that his graduation certificate will be a springboard for a better career in a wine-related industry, perhaps as a sommelier in a restaurant, a job that can pay from $65,000 to more than $100,00 a year, and “even more in the top restaurants in Las Vegas,” according to Ms. Frederick. Someone with an educated nose can also find work for a wine importer or distributor. “There’s so much to remember,” said Mr. Lopez, 32, a waiter at Fresco by Scotto, a Manhattan restaurant. “To tell you the truth, I’m a little bit worried about the final,” he said between sips from a glass of Barolo, from northern Italy. “This stuff is fascinating, but there’s a lot of it to learn.” On Tuesday, he learned even more. Ms. Frederick, who owns a wine consulting business in Manhattan but is better known among the Sommelier Society for her vintage lectures, gave the class a list of what she believed were the five best wine-making grapes in all of Italy: nebbiolo, sangiovese, sagrantino, aglianico and corvina. She then warned: “You should know about Chianti for the final. It’s a classic red wine from Tuscany. You will always get questions about Chianti.” “And now,” Ms. Frederick said, turning the pages of her handwritten notes, “I’d like to talk about fermentation.” Caitlin Makowski, 21, a server at the highly rated and expensive Per Se Restaurant in the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, has dreams of owning her own restaurant and called her sommelier studies “a starting point.” “If you want to own a restaurant, you need a great deal of wine knowledge,” said Ms. Makowski, who lives in Elmhurst, Queens. She was the youngest of the students, who ranged in age from the early 20s to late 50s and paid $945 for the course. “I’m used to tasting lots of wines at work, but classes like these educate me on the backgrounds of those wines.” With any luck, Ms. Makowski will find a better job in the industry, as so many of Ms. Frederick’s former students have, in jobs scattered through the city. “Sommeliers are definitely in demand,” Ms. Frederick said. “There is a serious shortage of wine-knowledgeable people in New York and around the country.” Eric Rosenfeld, 28, who took the sommelier course in the fall of 2006, is now the general manager at Gemma, a restaurant at the Bowery Hotel. Shortly after earning his certificate, he landed a job as the sommelier at the Waverly Inn in the West Village. “I got into the restaurant business through my knowledge of wines,” he said. So did Paula Maia, 36, who took the course in the winter of 2006, and in April 2007 opened the Oak Wine Bar and Café in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with her partner, Kevin Megan. “Ms. Frederick was an awesome instructor,” Ms. Maia said. “Everybody who wants to work in this business should take that class.” And then there is Natalie Sanz, the 26-year-old owner of Las Ramblas, a tapas bar at 170 West Fourth Street, who took the sommelier course in the spring of 2006 so that she could expand the wine list in her restaurant. “I’m more likely to hire someone who has a great knowledge of wine over someone else who doesn’t,” said Ms. Sanz, whose staff includes Michael Hands, a wine server who is currently taking the sommelier course. Robert R. Moody, the chairman of the Sommelier Society, sat in on the class. The organization, he said, began in 1954 at the “21” “21”Club in New York, when a group of restaurant workers with noses for fine wines wanted to be labeled more than waiters. “The wine waiters felt they weren’t being fairly compensated, and so they wanted an organization that could guarantee them tips they felt they deserved for suggesting certain wines to the clientele,” Mr. Moody said. “The “21” Club was a hot place to go because it had an excellent wine cellar.” Juan Benítez, a past president of the Sommelier Society who once served wine at “21” to the likes of Richard M. Nixon, Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra and Muhammad Ali, now owns Vintage Wines, an importer and distributor of wines on Staten Island. “I recommended Le Montrachet, a white wine, to Mr. Sinatra, who loved it and became one of my best tippers,” said Mr. Benítez, 59. “The more you know about wines,” Mr. Benítez said, “the further you will get in this business.” And that is why Mr. Lopez — his cheeks a bit rosy midway through Tuesday’s lecture — has been at the midnight vino. “If I drink too much in class, or too much when I’m studying at home, I get a little tipsy,” he said. “It’s hard not to drink all this good stuff while I’m learning about it.”",

    "source": "Women’s March on Washington Opens Contentious Dialogues About Race <eos> Many thousands of women are expected to converge on the nation’s capital for the Women’s March on Washington the day after Donald J. Trump’s inauguration. Jennifer Willis no longer plans to be one of them. Ms. Willis, a 50-year-old wedding minister from South Carolina, had looked forward to taking her daughters to the march. Then she read a post on the Facebook page for the march that made her feel unwelcome because she is white. The post, written by a black activist from Brooklyn who is a march volunteer, advised “white allies” to listen more and talk less. It also chided those who, it said, were only now waking up to racism because of the election. “You don’t just get to join because now you’re scared, too,” read the post. “I was born scared.” Stung by the tone, Ms. Willis canceled her trip. “This is a women’s march,” she said. “We’re supposed to be allies in equal pay, marriage, adoption. Why is it now about, ‘White women don’t understand black women’?” If all goes as planned, the Jan. 21 march will be a momentous display of unity in protest of a president whose treatment of women came to dominate the campaign’s final weeks. But long before the first buses roll to Washington and sister demonstrations take place in other cities, contentious conversations about race have erupted nearly every day among marchers, exhilarating some and alienating others. In Tennessee, emotions ran high when organizers changed the name of the local march from “Women’s March on Washington-Nashville” to “Power Together Tennessee, in solidarity with Women’s March on Washington.” While many applauded the name change, which was meant to signal the start of a new social justice movement in Nashville, some complained that the event had turned from a march for all women into a march for black women. In Louisiana, the first state coordinator gave up her volunteer role in part because there were no minority women in leadership positions at that time. “I got a lot of flak locally when I stepped down, from white women who said that I’m alienating a lot of white women,” said Candice Huber, a bookstore owner in New Orleans, who is white. “They said, ‘Why do you have to be so divisive?’” In some ways, the discord is by design. Even as they are working to ensure a smooth and unified march next week, the national organizers said they made a deliberate decision to highlight the plight of minority and undocumented immigrant women and provoke uncomfortable discussions about race. “This was an opportunity to take the conversation to the deep places,” said Linda Sarsour, a Muslim who heads the Arab American Association of New York and is one of four co-chairwomen of the national march. “Sometimes you are going to upset people.” The post that offended Ms. Willis was part of that effort. So was the quotation posted on the march’s Facebook page from Bell Hooks, the black feminist, about forging a stronger sisterhood by “confronting the ways women — through sex, class and race — dominated and exploited other women.” In response, a New Jersey woman wrote: “I’m starting to feel not very welcome in this endeavor.” A debate then ensued about whether white women were just now experiencing what minority women experience daily, or were having a hard time yielding control. A young white woman from Baltimore wrote with bitterness that white women who might have been victims of rape and abuse were being “asked to check their privilege,” a catchphrase that refers to people acknowledging their advantages, but which even some liberal women find unduly confrontational. No one involved with the march fears that the rancor will dampen turnout; even many of those who expressed dismay at the tone of the discussion said they still intended to join what is sure to be the largest demonstration yet against the Trump presidency. “I will march,” one wrote on the march’s Facebook page, “Hoping that someday soon a sense of unity will occur before it’s too late.” But these debates over race also reflect deeper questions about the future of progressivism in the age of Trump. Should the march highlight what divides women, or what unites them? Is there room for women who have never heard of “white privilege”? And at a time when a presidential candidate ran against political correctness and won — with half of white female voters supporting him — is this the time to tone down talk about race or to double down? Women’s March on Washington: What You Need to Know Many thousands of people are expected to march in protest of the new president on Jan. 21, his first full day in office. “If your short-term goal is to get as many people as possible at the march, maybe you don’t want to alienate people,” said Anne Valk, the author of “Radical Sisters,” a book about racial and class differences in the women’s movement. “But if your longer-term goal is to use the march as a catalyst for progressive social and political change, then that has to include thinking about race and class privilege.” The discord also reflects the variety of women’s rights and liberal causes being represented at the march, as well as a generational divide. Many older white women spent their lives fighting for rights like workplace protections that younger women now take for granted. Many young activists have spent years protesting police tactics and criminal justice policies — issues they feel too many white liberals have ignored. “Yes, equal pay is an issue,” Ms. Sarsour said. “But look at the ratio of what white women get paid versus black women and Latina women.” For too long, the march organizers said, the women’s rights movement focused on issues that were important to well-off white women, such as the ability to work outside the home and attain the same high-powered positions that men do. But minority women, they said, have had different priorities. Black women who have worked their whole lives as maids might care more about the minimum wage or police brutality than about seeing a woman in the White House. Undocumented immigrant women might care about abortion rights, they said, but not nearly as much as they worry about being deported. This brand of feminism — frequently referred to as “intersectionality” — asks white women to acknowledge that they have had it easier. It speaks candidly about the history of racism, even within the feminist movement itself. The organizers of the 1913 suffrage march on Washington asked black women to march at the back of the parade. The issue of race has followed the march from its inception. The day after the election, Bob Bland, a fashion designer in New York, floated the idea of a march in Washington on Facebook. Within hours, 3,000 people said they would join. Then a friend called to tell Ms. Bland that a woman in Hawaii with a similar page had collected pledges from 12,000 people. “I thought, ‘Wow, let’s merge,’” Ms. Bland recalled. As the effort grew, a number of comments on Facebook implored Ms. Bland, who is white, to include minority women on the leadership team. Ms. Bland felt strongly that it was the right thing to do. Within three days of the election, Carmen Perez, a Hispanic activist working on juvenile justice, and Tamika D. Mallory, a gun control activist who is black, joined Ms. Bland. Gloria Steinem , honorary co-chairwoman of the march along with Harry Belafonte , lauded their approach. “Sexism is always made worse by racism — and vice versa,” she said in an email. Ms. Steinem, who plans to participate in a town hall meeting during the march with Alicia Garza, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, said even contentious conversations about race were a “good thing.” “It’s about knowing each other,” she wrote. “Which is what movements and marches are for.” But the tone of the discussion, particularly online, can become so raw that some would-be marchers feel they are no longer welcome. Ms. Willis, the South Carolina wedding minister, had been looking forward to the salve of rallying with people who share her values, a rarity in her home state, where she said she had been insulted and shouted at for marrying gay couples. But then she read a post by ShiShi Rose, a 27-year-old blogger from Brooklyn. “Now is the time for you to be listening more, talking less,” Ms. Rose wrote. “You should be reading our books and understanding the roots of racism and white supremacy. Listening to our speeches. You should be drowning yourselves in our poetry.” It rubbed Ms. Willis the wrong way. “How do you know that I’m not reading black poetry?” she asked in an interview. Ms. Willis says that she understands being born white gives her advantages, and that she is always open to learning more about the struggles of others. But, she said, “The last thing that is going to make me endeared to you, to know you and love you more, is if you are sitting there wagging your finger at me.” Ms. Rose said in an interview that the intention of the post was not to weed people out but rather to make them understand that they had a lot of learning to do. “I needed them to understand that they don’t just get to join the march and not check their privilege constantly,” she said. That phrase — check your privilege — exasperates Ms. Willis. She asked a reporter: “Can you please tell me what that means?”",

    "source": "Okla. Town’s Residents Stay Put in Tornadoes’ Cross Hairs <eos> MOORE, Okla. — Along a nearly 20-mile path of caved-in buildings, upside-down cars and muddy rubble, there was a different sort of stunning sight on Wednesday — a homeowner, broom in hand, sweeping the driveway, trying to make at least one patch of land here the way it used to be. For more than a century, this Oklahoma City suburb has taken a battering in Tornado Alley. At least 22 tornadoes have struck in or near Moore, killing more than 100 people, since the town was incorporated in 1893, according to the National Weather Service. The tornado that destroyed dozens of homes, businesses and schools on Monday carved a destructive path for 17 miles and killed at least 24 people, but the one that touched down May 3, 1999, left an even longer, deadlier trail, staying on the ground for 38 miles and killing 36. Despite the continual destruction, people have not fled Moore. They have stayed put and rebuilt, and others have moved to the town. Nearly 19,000 people lived here in 1970; by 2011, there were 56,000 residents. Moore is a working-class suburb at the southern edge of Oklahoma City where churches outnumber bars and Republicans outnumber Democrats. In the 1890s, a railroad employee named Al Moore who lived in a boxcar had trouble receiving his mail at a settlement here. He painted his name on a board and nailed it on the boxcar, and the town’s name was born, city officials say. Image The rubble of Plaza Towers Elementary School in Moore, Okla., on Wednesday. Credit Matthew Staver for The New York Times Most residents are white, and the town has a median household income of $56,601, higher than the $44,973 median in Oklahoma City. People park their R.V.’s in the driveway, next to their cars as well as their boats. They work in the oil and energy industry, run small businesses, cut hair, wait tables, tutor schoolchildren. The longtime mayor, Glenn Lewis, owns a jewelry store. The Republican lawmaker who represents the area in the state House of Representatives, Mark McBride, owns a roofing and home building company. “It is a blue-collar town,” he said. “We’re pretty plain. We pay cash for things down here.” Mr. McBride, 52, was born and raised in Moore and still lives here, and in his cowboy hat, boots and jeans he embodies the town’s unpretentious manner. At a news conference, he stood and announced on live television that if anyone needed a place to stay, he had room at his house. Then he gave out his cellphone number. “I wasn’t joking,” Mr. McBride said. “I’ve got extra beds and a couch.” Ken and Doris Saxon moved to a red-brick home a few blocks from City Hall in 1962 with their four young children. A few years later, a tornado damaged Moore High School, where Mrs. Saxon’s brother was band director. There were other close calls: The 1999 tornado struck about 10 blocks north, and on Monday, they crouched in their bathroom, holding pillows and comforters over their heads. Their home, and their neighbors’ houses, were spared any major damage. On Wednesday afternoon, the couple — their children are grown, and they are great-grandparents — was busy outside in the yard, picking up fallen tree limbs and branches. Mrs. Saxon, 78, a retired office manager, had her red gardening gloves on, while her husband, 80, a retired auto mechanic, rested in the shade. She recalled that when the tornado hit the high school decades ago, her brother had been leading the school band in a performance. The roof came off and the rain poured in. He told them to stay and keep playing. “In California you have earthquakes,” Mrs. Saxon said. “In New York, you have hurricanes. Everywhere you’ve got something. We just choose this over everything else. It’s a good place to live. It’s home.” In some of the damaged areas of the city, it is hard to tell what Moore used to be. In a residential area near the destroyed Moore Medical Center, the homes on Southwest Sixth Street were reduced to piles of wood, concrete and red brick. Marking the horizon were a few shells of homes, barkless trees and chimney stacks. The Return to Moore 13 Photos View Slide Show › Image Matthew Staver for The New York Times Late Tuesday evening, this flattened Moore was not the real Moore: there were no residents picking through their belongings, only reporters and news crews and TV trucks. Nearby, there were blockades run by National Guard members in the middle of what were once bustling intersections. On Wednesday, the real Moore was on display at the Madison Place subdivision, where homeowners backed trailers and pickup trucks into their driveways and began cleaning up. The neighborhood was heavily damaged, but still recognizable, though with surreal touches. A thick shard of wood punctured a blue slide at a playground like a dagger; a UPS driver made his rounds, delivering to homes that were barely standing. At a two-story brick house at the end of a cul-de-sac, you had to imagine the upstairs room where Crystal Sheppard’s children once slept. There was no more upstairs. There was just a window pane and open sky. Ms. Sheppard, 26, moved to Moore in April 2011 with her husband, her 4-year-old son and two girls who are foster children, drawn by the reputation of the local school district. She is a stay-at-home mother. Her husband, Daunte, 27, is a finance manager at a Chevrolet dealership. On Monday, Ms. Sheppard was at home with the two girls when the tornado approached. Her son was at his prekindergarten and her husband was at work. She grabbed the girls and, joined by a neighbor, sped away. “It was behind us and we just tried to keep ahead of it,” she said. “It was literally pedal to the metal.” On Wednesday, she and her husband removed some of their undamaged furniture and appliances. Underneath the rubble in the patio, she pulled her son’s pre-k graduation picture. They will stay in town. “We’re not moving from Moore,” she said. “We’ll just have a shelter built.”",

    "source": "Rem Vyakhirev, Former Chief of Gazprom, Dies at 78 <eos> MOSCOW — Rem I. Vyakhirev, who as chief executive of the huge Russian energy company Gazprom during the 1990s resisted efforts by reformers to break up and privatize it, only to end his tenure a billionaire owning valuable pieces of the company himself, died on Feb. 11. He was 78. His death was confirmed by a Gazprom spokesman, who did not provide the cause or place of death. Early in the post-Soviet period, Mr. Vyakhirev seized on the possibilities of exploiting the sheer power and scale of the Russian natural gas industry — both for the government and for private enrichment. His career spanned the transformation of what had been the Soviet ministry of gas into the world’s largest natural gas company. By the time he left Gazprom, in 2001, forced out in a din of criticism over missing assets, Forbes magazine estimated his net worth at $1.5 billion. All along, though, Mr. Vyakhirev, reflecting a strange cognitive dissonance that characterized his career, espoused the benefits of state ownership of natural gas fields and pipelines. Gazprom, which is controlled by the Russian government but is 50 percent owned by private investors, remained whole while the Russian oil industry was split up and sold piecemeal. The company supplies about a quarter of all gas consumed in Europe today. “The gas industry should be in one pair of hands, in state hands,” Mr. Vyakhirev said in September in an interview with the Russian edition of Forbes. “There’s all this talk about gas being an addiction, how to get off the gas needle. That’s ridiculous. Gas is a wet nurse, not a needle.” Rem Ivanovich Vyakhirev was born on Aug. 23, 1934, in a village in the Samara region of southern Russia. His given name is an acronym evoking socialist progress: Revolution, Engels and Marx. By the late 1980s, he had risen to deputy minister of gas in the Soviet Union. He assumed control of Gazprom in 1992, when his patron, the former minister of gas, Viktor S. Chernomyrdon , was appointed prime minister under President Boris N. Yeltsin. Mr. Vyakhirev and a tight group of associates held sway over Gazprom’s assets, including whole towns in Siberia. The company became an island of the old Soviet system in the new Russia, known as the state within the state, a paternalistic monopoly with tens of thousands of coddled employees. The company’s staggering wealth and size made Mr. Vyakhirev one of Russia’s most powerful men. He was able to shrug off efforts by the tax ministry to collect billions in arrears from the company in the mid-1990s. He also aided the state by informally ladling out funds from the corporate budget. Yevgeny Yasin, the minister of economy at the time, recalled Mr. Vyakhirev’s eagerness to help the government on such projects as rebuilding a cathedral in Moscow. “He always helped,” Mr. Yasin said, as quoted by Public Post, a news Web site. “Gazprom was a second budget, in fact an ‘extra pocket’ for the government, to be used during especially difficult situations.” All the while, beginning with a quiet deal soon after the company’s founding that allowed company executives to buy up to 30 percent of Gazprom shares at auctions they controlled, pieces of Gazprom slipped away to nonstate entities. Public documents and financial records later showed that some assets went to Mr. Vyakhirev and members of his family, a sign of the rough and loose ways of early Russian capitalism. One deal, for example, transferred about $185 million worth of gas fields to Sibneftegaz, a subsidiary partly owned by Mr. Vyakhirev’s relatives. As pressure mounted to oust Mr. Vyakhirev, Boris Fyodorov, a former minister of finance, disclosed that tens of billions of dollars worth of gas sales from Russia to former Soviet countries like Ukraine went through Itera, a trading company based in Jacksonville, Fla., and partly owned by Gazprom managers. President Vladimir V. Putin, in consolidating political control over Russia early in his first term, ousted Mr. Vyakhirev in 2001 by having government appointees on the board cancel his contract. Mr. Vyakhirev stayed on as chairman for a year. The new director, Aleksey B. Miller, then set about unraveling the old management’s insider deals. Gazprom’s stock rallied for a time before the global recession, but has been in a swoon for years. The company is losing market share in Europe because of price pressure from the gas industry in the United States. Mr. Vyakhirev’s survivors include a son, Yuri, and a daughter, Tatyana Vyakhireva. In the Forbes interview last year, Mr. Vyakhirev said he had taken up hobby farming in retirement. “I never wanted to be the head of a company,” he said. “But why refuse if the entire business is in your hands? If you give it to somebody, they would either drink it away or lose it.”",

    "source": "Military Paper Challenges Defense Dept. <eos> WASHINGTON — Top editors at the military newspaper Stars and Stripes are asking for full disclosure of the paper’s relationship with a Department of Defense publicity program, called America Supports You, after disclosures that money for the program was funneled through the newspaper. The newspaper’s two top editors have asked that the acting publisher, Max D. Lederer Jr., and the Pentagon official who oversees the program, Allison Barber, release details of a relationship that involves employees of the newspaper’s business department overseeing contracts on behalf of America Supports You. The program was established three years ago to build public support for the troops. “This is not how an editorially independent newspaper should conduct itself,” the executive editor, Robb Grindstaff, and managing editor, Doug Clawson, said in a Dec. 8 letter to Mr. Lederer and Ms. Barber, and copied to the secretary of defense. The letter added that the refusal to release information was damaging morale on the editorial side of the paper. “The integrity and credibility of both Stars and Stripes and the D.O.D. public affairs department with our audience is negatively impacted by this continuing scenario,” Mr. Grindstaff and Mr. Clawson wrote. The newspaper, financed in part by the Pentagon, is part of the American Forces Information Service and reports ultimately to Ms. Barber, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for public liaison and internal communications. The editors’ letter follows an e-mail message sent in November by six midlevel editors of the newspaper requesting Mr. Lederer’s resignation after he failed to respond to their request that he release documents detailing the paper’s financial dealings with America Supports You. Thomas P. Skeen, the newspaper’s senior editor in the Pacific who signed the e-mail message, said the issue came down to the credibility of the newspaper. “To me personally it was just hypocrisy at its worst,” Mr. Skeen said of the refusal to release the details of the relationship between the newspaper and the program. In an interview, Ms. Barber said that there were no plans to release the details and that all money spent by Stars and Stripes had been reimbursed. America Supports You has been the subject of an inquiry by the Defense Department’s inspector general. The audit is one of four examining the office of the assistant secretary of defense for public affairs, according to the inspector general’s office. The inspector general inquiry is looking at the relationship between America Supports You and Stars and Stripes, which have different types of financing. Because Stars and Stripes relies partly on advertising revenue, it operates with fewer guidelines and restrictions than other Pentagon programs that rely solely on appropriated funds, including America Supports You. Ms. Barber said the choice to involve the Stars and Stripes business department was made out of expediency and had nothing to do with the looser financing regulations. An audit, announced in October, is examining whether the Joint Civilian Orientation Conference, a Pentagon outreach program that educates civilian leaders about the military, is in compliance with the law and Defense Department policies. After a Stars and Stripes reporter, Jeff Schogol, discovered that the inspector general’s office had widened the inquiry to include the newspaper, he investigated and wrote articles that the newspaper published. Documents have been posted on the paper’s Web site, www.stripes.com , that describe payments, including a $499,000 purchase agreement between Stars and Stripes and a contractor doing work for the America Supports You program. The documents stipulate that work be submitted to employees on the business side of the paper for an advertising program and a Web site for America Supports You. In November, Mr. Lederer sent an e-mail message to employees conceding that using the newspaper as a contracting agent for America Supports You might have been unwise and that more debate was necessary. Perception of objectivity has always been a thorny issue for the editorial staff because the paper is supposed to be free from government censorship — but is owned and partly financed by the government. By statute, the newspaper is guaranteed editorial independence. There are stipulations, including that the newspaper cannot knowingly publish classified information that has not been disclosed elsewhere. Ms. Barber said it was only recently that the news staff voiced concerns about the relationship with the publicity program. “What I would say is if we’ve had the America Supports You contract for maybe two years, and they didn’t even know about it, then clearly there is that established firewall that you have to have in an organization that is a First Amendment organization,” she said.",

    "source": "New Neurons Found to Overwrite Old Memories <eos> The inability of adults to recall experiences from early childhood may be linked to the creation of new neurons in the brain. Throughout a person’s life, neurons are constantly made in the hippocampus, a region of the brain associated with memory. To see whether this process, known as neurogenesis, could drive the loss of childhood memories, researchers ran tests with animals trained to fear a particular environment through electric shock. Adult mice that were made to run on a wheel, an activity that encourages the birth of new neurons, quickly lost their fear of the troubling environment, while mice that didn’t run seemed to retain their memories. Infant mice treated with drugs to slow neurogenesis were also better at retaining memories of the shocks than those not given drugs. The researchers ran similar tests on guinea pigs and degus, which experience less infant neurogenesis than other animals. When left untreated, these rodents did not forget the shocks as quickly as infant mice did. But when treated with drugs that stimulate neurogenesis, they, too, were more likely to forget. “When new neurons are born and mature and integrate into these pre-existing neural circuits, they’re going to change the connections that existed before,” said Katherine Akers, now at Wayne State University and lead author of the study. “Changing these connections might degrade the integrity of the pre-existing memories.” The findings, published in the journal Science , could help lead to treatments for adults with memory or cognition problems, she said.

    "source": "Giants Hope for U-Turn on Familiar Trip <eos> EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The 0-2 Giants found a ray of hope this week in the knowledge that their last such start came in 2007, when they swept their next six games and went on to win Super Bowl XLII. The belief that they can repeat such a turnaround could hinge on how they fare Sunday against quarterback Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers, an opponent they are meeting at a familiar time and place. The Giants traveled to Charlotte, N.C., with a 1-1 record in their third regular-season game last year. They used a 36-7 thumping of the Panthers to start a torrid stretch in which they won five of six games. That helped lead to a winning record (9-7) but not a playoff berth. “There has to be a sense of urgency,” defensive end Justin Tuck said of this year’s slow start, “because we are not getting those two games back.” Any sense of déjà vu surrounding Sunday’s kickoff in Charlotte ends for the Giants with the absence of running back Andre Brown. Against the Panthers on Sept. 20, 2012, Brown carried 20 times for 113 yards and 2 touchdowns. He and the rest of the Giants’ offense played the best possible defense against Newton by keeping him off the field; the Giants dominated the time of possession, keeping the ball for 36 minutes 10 seconds. This year, Brown is on injured reserve until mid-November with a broken left leg. The Giants have missed his hard-charging style. With their aging offensive line struggling to create running lanes, they have 33 rushing attempts for 73 yards, a meager 36.5 yards per game. It appears the defense will also be lacking a key figure: cornerback Corey Webster is listed as doubtful after missing Friday’s practice with a hip injury. Aaron Ross is expected to make his first start for the Giants since Super Bowl XLVI to close the 2011 season. He left as a free agent to sign with Jacksonville but played only one year with the Jaguars before he was released. Ross said that he had not been told he would start but that he would embrace the opportunity. “I love to play. I love to compete. I’m a fierce competitor,” he said. “Any time I have a chance to go out there, I’m excited.” Ross, drafted by the Giants in the first round in 2007, said he had always been ready to rejoin the lineup. He said of his study habits: “It’s the same as it is every week. I go in preparing like I’m a starter, because you never know what is going to happen.” Ross hurried into action in the season-opening 36-31 loss at the Dallas Cowboys when Prince Amukamara collided with safety Ryan Mundy and sustained a concussion. Ross held up well against Tony Romo, the Cowboys’ elusive passer. “We’re not looking for any kind of letdown,” safety Antrel Rolle said of the probable lineup change. “We’re looking for Ross to play ball as he did against Dallas.” No matter the circumstances, the Giants expressed confidence they could defeat the Panthers if they repeated the success they had last year against Newton, the first player taken in the 2011 draft and one of the game’s most dynamic players. The Giants held Newton to 16-of-30 passing for 242 yards and intercepted him three times. Although Newton is difficult to tackle at 6 feet 5 inches and 245 pounds, the Giants limited his effectiveness as a ball carrier by taking a double-digit lead. He rushed six times for 6 yards, including his team’s only touchdown. It came in the third quarter, after the visitors had built a 23-0 lead. It was a rare poor afternoon for Newton, who became the only player in N.F.L. history to pass for more than 8,000 yards (8,045) and 40 touchdowns (41) while running for more than 1,000 yards (1,045) and 20 touchdowns (22) in his first 33 games. He passed for 3,869 yards and rushed for 741 yards and 8 touchdowns last year, when he became the first quarterback to lead his team in rushing since Donovan McNabb paced the Philadelphia Eagles in 2000. “He is a special athlete,” Mundy said. “He can bring the ball down and get 5 yards or he can get 70 yards.” Although the Giants have only two sacks, defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka said he thought they could turn up the pressure against Newton. “Everybody knows about his feet and when he escapes the pocket, that he can still look down the field and he can make people miss,” Kiwanuka said. “So our job will be to push the pocket, get people up in his face and make sure we get him down on the ground.” EXTRA POINTS Hakeem Nicks was given an excused absence from practice so he could attend to personal matters. Nicks was expected back for Sunday’s game. ... Coach Tom Coughlin continued to keep focus on the game rather than on the death of his younger brother, John, who will be buried Tuesday. Asked how his players had rallied around him, Coughlin said: “Let’s not go there, please. Everybody’s working hard to get where we want to be.”",

    "source": "Trial Opens for Imelda Marcos’s Ex-Aide <eos> When the former personal secretary to Imelda Marcos contacted a London gallery three years ago about selling a Monet masterpiece that Mrs. Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines, had bought in the 1970s, the gallery was understandably leery. The ex-secretary, Vilma Bautista, possessed only one thing to prove she was authorized to sell the painting: a single-page document from 1991 naming her as Mrs. Marcos’s agent. That document will be a key piece of evidence in Ms. Bautista’s conspiracy trial, which began in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Wednesday. Ms. Bautista, a diminutive 74-year-old with a bamboo cane and oversize glasses, has been charged with illegally conspiring with two nephews to sell four paintings that Mrs. Marcos had acquired with state money at the height of her husband’s power. She is also charged with failing to pay taxes on millions she reaped from the sale of one painting. “It’s a simple story of greed, opportunism and fraud,” Garrett Lynch, an assistant district attorney, said to the jury. The London gallery, Marlborough Fine Art , eventually agreed to handle the sale, and a Swiss collector agreed to pay $32 million for the masterpiece, Claude Monet’s well-known water lily painting, “Le Bassin aux Nymphéas” (1899). That painting had disappeared from an Upper East Side town house in late 1985, along with another Monet work and valuable paintings by Alfred Sisley and Albert Marquet, just before President Ferdinand Marcos was removed from power. The house had been the Philippine Consulate, but Mrs. Marcos had treated it as her New York residence. Mr. Lynch said Ms. Bautista had taken the paintings and hidden them for two decades, even though she was aware the Philippine government wanted to recover some of them. Then she ran out of money. “She was broke, she was financially desperate, she had to find some income,” he said. “Beginning in 2009, she turned to the last thing she could to generate money: the missing paintings she had been sitting on for so many years.” Mr. Lynch said Ms. Bautista and her two nephews in Bangkok tried unsuccessfully to sell the paintings on the black market in Thailand. Then Ms. Bautista started peddling the Monet masterpiece to galleries in New York and London. Selling that work was less problematic, Mr. Lynch said, because it had never been placed on the Philippine government’s list of missing paintings. After the sale, Mr. Lynch said, Ms. Bautista paid off her debts, bought a $2.2 million condominium in Manhattan, sent $5 million to her nephews and banked about $15 million, never sending a dime to Mrs. Marcos. Ms. Bautista’s lawyer, Susan Hoffinger, argued that her client had been thrust into a political struggle between the Marcos family and the family of President Benigno Aquino in the Philippines. No court in the Philippines has ruled on whether the paintings belong to the state or to Mrs. Marcos, she said. “Vilma Bautista has been made a scapegoat in this political struggle, criminally charged with her future put at stake,” she said. Ms. Hoffinger also asserted that the 1991 document giving Ms. Bautista the right to sell the painting — known as a certificate of authority — was still valid. The prosecution had said it would be proved fraudulent. “That’s just speculation,” Ms. Hoffinger said. “The prosecution didn’t tell you in his opening that they will bring Imelda Marcos in to testify here. They will not. They aren’t bringing her. Without that testimony from Mrs. Marcos, there will be no evidence that that certificate of authority isn’t valid.”",

    "source": "Budget Cuts Reshape New York’s Public Housing <eos> The crushing news came less than a year after Diane Robinson and her 24-year-old son moved into an airy two-bedroom apartment in the Bronx. The city, which helps pay her rent, wrote this summer to say she would have to downsize into a one-bedroom apartment or pay $240 more a month in rent. A public school aide, Ms. Robinson, 48, decided to stay in the apartment, in the Castle Hill neighborhood . But on an annual income of about $25,000, she is struggling, she said, and she does not know how long she can hang on. Moving to a one-bedroom apartment would mean that her son, a college student who works to help with food and utilities, would have to sleep in the living room. “My son works — he’s not entitled to have his own bedroom?” she said. “Next thing they’re going to tell me is that I’m not entitled to a roof over my head.” Thousands of New York City tenants are facing similar choices because of cuts to the federal Section 8 voucher program and the resulting belt-tightening by the city. The rental vouchers allow low- and moderate-income tenants to live in private buildings and to pay about 30 percent of their income in rent, with the voucher program making up the rest. The cost of the program is about $400 million a year. But federal budget cuts under sequestration last year have left the program $37 million short, the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development said. The agency, which administers the affected vouchers, stopped issuing new ones, rescinded dozens that had already been issued and declared more than 9,000 households “overhoused.” Such tenants were told to move to smaller, less expensive apartments or, if they chose to stay put, to be prepared to pay a higher rent in most cases because their subsidy will shrink. For the city, absent an infusion of funding, the alternative was ending subsidies outright for 3,000 Section 8 households, the housing and preservation agency said. Many of those households would then be at risk of homelessness at a time when the de Blasio administration is already working to reduce record numbers of homeless families. The downsizing, though, can be a painful process, robbing some longtime tenants of one of the things New Yorkers value the most in a crowded city — space. And it has outraged some elected officials and tenant leaders, who say the cuts are putting an undue burden on lower-income tenants. Like Ms. Robinson, many of them are trying to hold onto their current apartments even if it means paying substantially more in rent, city officials said. The current situation for her and her son, Malcolm Gibbs, is not sustainable, Ms. Robinson said, because the newly increased rent — she now pays $1,038 while the voucher pays $507 to her landlord — takes almost all of her paycheck. Under the new standards, two-person households living in two-bedroom apartments, like Ms. Robinson’s, must switch to a one-bedroom regardless of the tenants’ genders, relationship or ages. Only households with three to four people are eligible for two-bedroom apartments. This means that in some cases a child and a parent may have to share the bedroom or someone may have to sleep in the living room. Image “At my age, I don’t deserve a tiny place,” said Christina Sanchez, 67, a retired cafeteria helper who has been asked to move from a one-bedroom apartment at 40 Waterside Plaza into a studio. Credit Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times Residents who live alone in apartments with bedrooms must move to studio apartments. Many of these voucher holders are older tenants who raised families in the larger units and now have an apartment full of a lifetime of belongings and mementos. Relatives of some older tenants said the notices about the moves, which started going out last year, had caused confusion and anxiety. In interviews, some of the older tenants said they worried about not having enough room for family visits or future needs like a live-in home health aide or a wheelchair. Others fretted over the more immediate problem of disposing of furniture and adjusting to smaller surroundings. “I can’t pull a sofa bed,” said Cristina Sanchez, 67, a retired school cafeteria helper who sleeps on a full bed in her small one-bedroom apartment in the Manhattan high rise where she has lived for 19 years. “At my age, I don’t deserve a tiny place.” About 120,000 city households receive Section 8 vouchers, with the housing preservation and development agency administering about one-quarter of those. Of the 32,000 under the agency’s control, a little less than one-third are affected by the downsizing cuts. The vast majority of Section 8 vouchers are administered by the New York City Housing Authority , which has also had its federal money cut. But the authority already had a policy of placing single tenants in studios and two-person households in one-bedrooms, so to deal with the federal cuts, the officials say they are not issuing new vouchers and have tapped reserves and other streams of federal funding. Vicki Been, the housing preservation agency’s commissioner, told the City Council at a public hearing this year that the agency anticipated further cuts in 2016. The cuts also affect affordable housing special populations like older adults and the formerly homeless, and the landlords who provide that housing, Ms. Been said in an interview. “Vouchers are absolutely critical to help this lowest income band, but they also help landlords who are fairly low-income themselves,” she said. “They shore up critical building stock that’s often left untouched by city programs.” Some vouchers pay thousands of dollars a month for units in high-rise buildings in areas like TriBeCa and the East River waterfront, where rents have risen much faster than household incomes. The average voucher subsidy is lower, though, ranging from $916 to $1,409, agency officials said. Image Ms. Sanchez has been asked to move from her 8th floor one-bedroom apartment at 40 Waterside Plaza into a smaller studio. Credit Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times Council members, troubled by the impact on tenants, in July approved $250,000 to help cover some moving expenses. Members also negotiated with housing officials to give tenants up to a year to move, instead of just the 30-day deadline that had been imposed on most households. But some elected officials, including the Manhattan borough president, Gale A. Brewer, have called for a moratorium on the relocations while other solutions are explored. Some tenant groups are considering legal action. “When did a bedroom become a luxury in the United States?” asked Rita Popper, a leader of a tenants group fighting the moves, Housing Alliance Against Downsizing . Norman Siegel, the civil rights lawyer and the former head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, who represents the alliance, said the moves might be disproportionately affecting older and disabled tenants. City figures show that about 60 percent of those in notified households are elderly, disabled or both, slightly higher than their 54 percent proportion in the overall Section 8 population, according to the housing preservation and development agency. Housing officials are waiving their policy for tenants who have a disability or medical condition that requires a larger unit to accommodate a live-in aide or medical equipment. The city had granted 699 accommodations as of late August. Ms. Robinson, who is claiming financial hardship, was denied her request to stay but she has secured a hearing in October to appeal that decision. Ms. Robinson said she was forced to move last year to her current two-bedroom because her previous landlord was not making repairs. But to cover moving expenses like a deposit and broker’s fee, she took out a $5,000 loan. Even with her son’s help, she sometimes has to go to her church for food. Having once spent three months in a shelter for domestic abuse victims, Ms. Robinson says her greatest fear now is to end up back in a shelter. “The rents keep going up, up and now they decide to make this cut,” she said. “I may be faced with being homeless.”",

    "source": "Science of Magic <eos> The reason he had picked me from the audience, Apollo Robbins insisted, was that I’d seemed so engaged, nodding my head and making eye contact as he and the other magicians explained the tricks of the trade. I believed him when he told me afterward, over dinner at the Venetian, that he hadn’t noticed the name tag identifying me as a science writer. But then everyone believes Apollo — as he expertly removes your wallet and car keys and unbuckles your watch. It was Sunday night on the Las Vegas Strip, where earlier this summer the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness was holding its annual meeting at the Imperial Palace Hotel. The organization’s last gathering had been in the staid environs of Oxford, but Las Vegas — the city of illusions, where the Statue of Liberty stares past Camelot at the Sphinx — turned out to be the perfect locale. After two days of presentations by scientists and philosophers speculating on how the mind construes, and misconstrues, reality, we were hearing from the pros: James (The Amazing) Randi, Johnny Thompson (The Great Tomsoni), Mac King and Teller — magicians who had intuitively mastered some of the lessons being learned in the laboratory about the limits of cognition and attention. “This wasn’t just a group of world-class performers,” said Susana Martinez-Conde, a scientist at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix who studies optical illusions and what they say about the brain. “They were hand-picked because of their specific interest in the cognitive principles underlying the magic.” She and Stephen Macknik, another Barrow researcher, organized the symposium, appropriately called the Magic of Consciousness. Apollo, with the pull of his eyes and the arc of his hand, swung around my attention like a gooseneck lamp, so that it always pointed in the wrong direction. When he appeared to be reaching for my left pocket he was swiping something from the right. At the end of the act the audience applauded as he handed me my pen, some crumpled receipts and dollar bills, and my digital audio recorder, which had been running all the while. I hadn’t noticed that my watch was gone until he unstrapped it from his own wrist. “He’s uncanny,” Teller said to me afterward as he rushed off for his nightly show with Penn at the Rio. A recurring theme in experimental psychology is the narrowness of perception: how very little of the sensory clamor makes its way into awareness. Earlier in the day, before the magic show, a neuroscientist had demonstrated a phenomenon called inattentional blindness with a video made at the Visual Cognition Laboratory at the University of Illinois. In the video, six men and women — half with white shirts and half with black — are tossing around a couple of basketballs. Viewers are asked to count how many times members of, say, the white team, manage to complete a pass, keeping the ball from the opposition. I dutifully followed the instructions and was surprised when some 15 seconds into the game, laughter began to ripple through the audience. Only when I watched a second time did I see the person in the gorilla suit walking on from stage left. (The video is online at viscog.beckman.uiuc.edu/grafs/demos/15.html .) Secretive as they are about specifics, the magicians were as eager as the scientists when it came to discussing the cognitive illusions that masquerade as magic: disguising one action as another, implying data that isn’t there, taking advantage of how the brain fills in gaps — making assumptions, as The Amazing Randi put it, and mistaking them for facts. Sounding more like a professor than a comedian and magician, Teller described how a good conjuror exploits the human compulsion to find patterns, and to impose them when they aren’t really there. “In real life if you see something done again and again, you study it and you gradually pick up a pattern,” he said as he walked onstage holding a brass bucket in his left hand. “If you do that with a magician, it’s sometimes a big mistake.” Pulling one coin after another from the air, he dropped them, thunk, thunk, thunk, into the bucket. Just as the audience was beginning to catch on — somehow he was concealing the coins between his fingers — he flashed his empty palm and, thunk, dropped another coin, and then grabbed another from a gentlemen’s white hair. For the climax of the act, Teller deftly removed a spectator’s glasses, tipped them over the bucket and, thunk, thunk, two more coins fell. As he ran through the trick a second time, annotating each step, we saw how we had been led to mismatch cause and effect, to form one false hypothesis after another. Sometimes the coins were coming from his right hand, and sometimes from his left, hidden beneath the fingers holding the bucket. He left us with his definition of magic: “The theatrical linking of a cause with an effect that has no basis in physical reality, but that — in our hearts — ought to.” • • • In his opening address, Michael Gazzaniga, the president of the consciousness association, had described another form of prestidigitation — a virtual reality experiment in which he had put on a pair of electronic goggles that projected the illusion of a deep hole opening in what he knew to be a solid concrete floor. Jolted by the adrenaline rush, his heart beat faster and his muscles tensed, a reminder that even without goggles the brain cobbles together a world from whatever it can. “In a sense our reality is virtual,” Dr. Gazzaniga said. “Think about flying in an airplane. You’re up there in an aluminum tube, 30,000 feet up, going 600 miles an hour, and you think everything is all right.” Dr. Gazzaniga is famous for his work with split-brain patients, whose left and right hemispheres have been disconnected as a last-ditch treatment for severe epilepsy . These are the experiments that have led to the notion, oversimplified in popular culture, that the left brain is predominantly analytical while the right brain is intuitive and laid-back. The left brain, as Dr. Gazzaniga put it, is the confabulator, constantly concocting stories. But mine was momentarily dumbstruck when, after his talk, I passed through a doorway inside the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and entered an air-conditioned simulation of the Grand Canal. My eyes were drawn upward to the stunning illusion of a trompe l’oeil sky and what I decided must be ravens flying high overhead. Looking closer, my brain discarded that theory, and I saw that the black curved wings were the edges of discs — giant thumbtacks holding up the sky. Later I was told they were automatic sprinklers, in case the clouds catch fire. “It’s ‘The Truman Show,’ ” said Robert Van Gulick, a philosopher at Syracuse University, as I joined him at a table overlooking a version of the Piazza San Marco. A sea breeze was wafting through the window, the clouds were glowing in the late afternoon sun (and they were still glowing, around 10:30 p.m., when I headed back toward my hotel). How could we be sure that the world outside the Venetian — outside Las Vegas itself — wasn’t also a simulation? Or that I wasn’t just a brain in a vat in some mad scientist’s laboratory. Dr. Van Gulick had come to the conference to talk about qualia, the raw, subjective sense we have of colors, sounds, tastes, touches and smells. The crunch of the crostini, the slitheriness of the penne alla vodka — a question preoccupying philosophers is where these personal experiences fit within a purely physical theory of the mind. Like physicists, philosophers play with such conundrums by engaging in thought experiments. In a recent paper, Michael P. Lynch, a philosopher at the University of Connecticut, entertained the idea of a “phenomenal pickpocket,” an imaginary creature, like Apollo the thief, who distracts your attention while he removes your qualia, turning you into what’s known in the trade as a philosophical zombie. You could catch a ball, hum a tune, stop at a red light — act exactly like a person but without any sense of what it is like to be alive. If zombies are logically possible, some philosophers insist, then conscious beings must be endowed with an ineffable essence that cannot be reduced to biological circuitry. Dr. Lynch’s fantasy was a ploy to undermine the zombie argument. But if zombies do exist, it is probably in Las Vegas. One evening as I walked across the floor of the Imperial Palace casino — a cacophony of clanging bells and electronic arpeggios — it was easy to imagine that the hominids parked in front of the one-armed bandits were simply extensions of the machines. “Intermittent conditioning,” suggested Irene Pepperberg, an adjunct associate professor at Brandeis University who studies animal intelligence. If you want to train a laboratory rat to pull a crank to get a food pellet, the reflex will be scratched in deeper if the creature is rewarded with some regularity but not all the time. Dr. Pepperberg has thrown a wild card into studies of consciousness with her controversial experiments with African gray parrots. With a brain “the size of a walnut,” as she puts it, the birds display what appears to be the cognitive potential of a young child. Her best-known parrot, Alex, can stare at a tray of objects and pick the one that has four corners and is blue. He has also coined his own word for almond — “cork nut.” With appearances on PBS and a cameo role in a Margaret Atwood novel, “Oryx and Crake,” Alex has entered the popular imagination, while Dr. Pepperberg struggles to find a secure academic position. Critics can’t resist comparing Alex to “Clever Hans,” the famous horse whose arithmetical abilities were exposed as learned responses to his trainer’s subtle cues. Dr. Pepperberg says she controls for that possibility in her experiments and believes her parrots are thinking and expressing themselves with words. • • • One evening out on the Strip, I spotted Daniel Dennett, the Tufts University philosopher, hurrying along the sidewalk across from the Mirage, which has its own tropical rain forest and volcano. The marquees were flashing and the air-conditioners roaring — Las Vegas stomping its carbon footprint with jackboots in the Nevada sand. I asked him if he was enjoying the qualia. “You really know how to hurt a guy,” he replied. For years Dr. Dennett has argued that qualia, in the airy way they have been defined in philosophy, are illusory. In his book “Consciousness Explained,” he posed a thought experiment involving a wine-tasting machine. Pour a sample into the funnel and an array of electronic sensors would analyze the chemical content, refer to a database and finally type out its conclusion: “a flamboyant and velvety Pinot, though lacking in stamina.” If the hardware and software could be made sophisticated enough, there would be no functional difference, Dr. Dennett suggested, between a human oenophile and the machine. So where inside the circuitry are the ineffable qualia? Retreating to a bar at the Imperial Palace, we talked about a different mystery he had been pondering: the role words play inside the brain. Learn a bit of wine speak — “ripe black plums with an accent of earthy leather” — and you are suddenly equipped with anchors to pin down your fleeting gustatory impressions. Words, he suggested, are “like sheepdogs herding ideas.” As he sipped his drink he tried out another metaphor, involving a gold panning technique he had learned about in New Zealand. Lead and gold are similar in density. If you salt the slurry with buck shot and swirl the pan around, the dark pellets will track the elusive flecks of gold. With a grab bag of devices accumulated over the eons, the brain pulls off the ultimate conjuring act: the subjective sense of I. “Stage magicians know that a collection of cheap tricks will often suffice to produce ‘magic,’ ” Dr. Dennett has written, “and so does Mother Nature, the ultimate gadgeteer.” At the end of the magic show where I was fleeced by Apollo, The Amazing Randi called on Dr. Dennett and another volunteer to help with the final act. As Mr. Randi sat on a chair, the two men tightly bound his arms to his thighs with a rope. “Daniel, would you take off your jacket for me for just a moment?” the conjuror asked. “Now drape it around the front of my hands.” “A little higher,” Mr. Randi said. Without missing a beat, he grabbed the collar and pulled it up toward his chin. The audience cheered. Either he had slipped the ropes in a matter of seconds or his hands had been free all along. “Allow people to make assumptions and they will come away absolutely convinced that assumption was correct and that it represents fact,” Mr. Randi said. “It’s not necessarily so.”",

    "source": "A Stirring Farewell to Muhammad Ali, Just as He Scripted It <eos> LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Muhammad Ali spent the better part of a decade planning his funeral, his friends and family said, and by late Friday afternoon it was evident what had taken him so long. In a spectacle that fanned across miles of his hometown, in memories that stretched over some of 20th-century America’s most turbulent years, and in prayers from the palette of faiths that he honored as paths to truth, he was laid to rest, one week after his death at age 74. Ali was eulogized in a grand sports arena by, among others, a priest and an imam, a rabbi and a monk, a former United States president and a famous comedian. Protégées and daughters and his wife remembered him. As they spoke, all stood beneath the flags of the United States and the Olympic Games, symbols of a man who saw himself as a citizen of America and of the world. Earlier in the day, his coffin traveled through nearly 20 miles of Louisville, cheered and saluted by tens of thousands of people who tossed flowers onto the hearse and chanted his name. On Thursday, a traditional Muslim ceremony was held here as a prelude to Friday’s embrace. Video Bill Clinton, Billy Crystal and Bryant Gumbel delivered eulogies for Muhammad Ali at a 15,000-seat sports arena in his hometown, Louisville today. Credit Credit Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images It was all part of a leave-taking that Ali had seen as a chance to lead once more by including Christians, Jews, Buddhists and Native Americans as speakers in an emphatic, if not explicitly spoken, renunciation of sectarianism and embrace of ecumenism. “Muhammad indicated that when the end came for him, he wanted to use his life and his death as a teaching moment,” Ali’s widow, Lonnie, said. He was 12 years old when his bicycle was stolen, she noted, and a police officer encouraged him to learn boxing. Teachers believed in him. Friends backed his career. Named the athlete of the 20th century by Sports Illustrated, Ali never settled for sportsman as his sole identity. Among the first speakers at the memorial was the Rev. Kevin Cosby of St. Stephen Church in Louisville, who said Ali had taken his place in history by rejecting the narrative of a country that had, from its earliest days, refused to recognize African-Americans as fully human and full citizens. That mattered because of the times he lived in, Dr. Cosby said, the context that helped define him just as the American Revolution had for George Washington and the Great Depression for Franklin D. Roosevelt. “He dared to love black people at a time when black people had a problem loving themselves,” Dr. Cosby said. “He dared to affirm the beauty of blackness, he dared to affirm the power and the capacity of African-Americans. He dared to love America’s most unloved race.” Image Ali’s widow, Lonnie, speaking at the service. “Muhammad indicated that when the end came for him, he wanted to use his life and his death as a teaching moment,” she said. Credit Lucas Jackson/Reuters President Obama, in Washington for his daughter’s high school graduation, sent a letter that said Ali’s example had inspired him to think how far he might one day go himself. “Ali was a radical, even in the most radical of times,” Mr. Obama wrote, in a letter read by his senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. “A loud, and proud, and unabashedly black voice in a Jim Crow world. His jabs knocked some sense into us, pushing us to expand our imagination.” Billy Crystal, a young and struggling comedian when he became friends with Ali, said the boxer had invited him to go for a training run one morning at a country club. Mr. Crystal said he explained that the club excluded Jews. Ali, he said, was incensed to learn this, saying, “I’m a black Muslim, and they let me run.” Ali never ran at that club again, Mr. Crystal said. He remembered, as well, that the silver-tongued Ali had lost his speech to illness in recent years, but that he continued to be a powerful force on humanitarian missions. “Ultimately, he became a silent messenger for peace, who taught us that life is best when you build bridges between people, not walls,” Mr. Crystal said. Drafted to serve in the Vietnam War, Ali said his faith could not countenance a combat role, and Ms. Ali noted that he refused to leave the country even though his stance cost him his boxing title and put him in jeopardy of prison. Mr. Crystal said Ali had set an example. “There were millions of young men my age, eligible for the draft for a war we didn’t believe in,” Mr. Crystal said. “It was Ali who stood up for us by standing up for himself.” Viewed through the lens of history, Ali’s stance on the Vietnam War is now widely seen as principled; at the time, he was denounced. Dr. Cosby noted that at the Kentucky Derby, gamblers cannot bet on a horse once it has reached the winner’s circle. Image The comedian Billy Crystal, speaking at Ali’s memorial service, said, “Ultimately, he became a silent messenger for peace.” Credit Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images “There were a lot of people who would bet on Muhammad Ali when he was in the winner’s circle,” Dr. Crosby said. “But the masses bet on him while he was still in the mud.” Close to 20,000 people were in the KFC Yum Center arena for the memorial, which lasted more than three hours, with 13 speakers in addition to members of the clergy who prayed and chanted. If the spectacle in the arena was global, the scenes on the roughly 19-mile procession were strictly local, pulsing with pride for a native son. Ali’s ties to the compact, quirky city of his youth never frayed. All business halted as workers streamed to the sidewalk to stand vigil in gently chaotic decorum. “It’s almost like we’re extended cousins,” said Andrea Meriwether, 31, a native of Louisville, who was taught pool by Ali’s younger brother, Rahman Ali. “I can’t think of anyone from here who hasn’t met him or had some connection.” Video Lifelong fans of the boxing legend Muhammad Ali gathered to pay respects outside his childhood home in Louisville, Ky., as his funeral went on in the same city. Along Broadway in the heart of downtown, those extended cousins, and other branches of the human family, stood eight and 10 deep on both sides of the street for blocks. With no pens to corral them on the sidewalk, the crowds seeped onto the roadway. “Everyone has a story,” said Mark Collins, 54, who recalled working in a bank when Ali, then in his magic-trick phase, performed an illusion of levitation. An especially jammed point was the corner where Broadway meets South Fourth Street, a central shopping and dining street. Now featuring chiseled atriums, it was a street where the young Ali, then known as Cassius Clay, would not have been allowed into the cafeterias of the department stores. Among those near that spot on Friday was Carolyn Miller-Cooper, the executive director of the city’s Human Relations Commission. “In Louisville, it was always a polite racism,” Ms. Miller-Cooper said. “You couldn’t go in and try on clothes. Children had to trace their foot on a sheet of paper for parents to bring to the store and try to buy the right-sized shoes.” Video Fans, peers and family members of Muhammad Ali's reacted to his death and reflected on his contributions to sports and society over the past week. Credit Credit Mark Humphrey/Associated Press For many in the crowd, Ali’s stature as a boxer was something they had heard about, a piece of history they had not lived; the appreciation of the man was for the place he claimed in the world. “I wasn’t around for those titles,” said Rodrecruz Hines, 32, an autoworker who held a single red rose as he waited. “To me, he had this charismatic character, and he stood up for our rights, for the rights of young black men.” As the hearse approached, chants of “Ali! Ali! Ali!” rose. People swarmed forward to toss flowers onto the hearse. Riding with the windows down, people in the limousines, including members of the Ali family, the actor Will Smith, and the mayor, Greg Fischer, slapped hands with the spectators as they passed. Ali returned often to Louisville, and Ms. Miller-Cooper, who serves on the board of the city’s Muhammad Ali Center, saw him at a gala for the center last fall, with Ms. Ali tending to him. Ms. Miller-Cooper’s admiration for both of them grew as he continued a public life, even if physically diminished. “He was pretty frail, but he was still out there, shining a light on Parkinson’s,” she said. “I think that was what showed he was the greatest — that he continued to live, not hide.”",

    "source": "Border Patrol Seeks to Add Digital Eyes to Its Ranks <eos> PHOENIX — Among the federal officials who gathered here this week for a conclave on border security, there was little talk of building a fence along the 2,000-mile Mexican border. Instead, the chatter was all about technology: about concentrating Border Patrol agents, equipped with late-model surveillance tools, in areas of frequent illegal traffic, while using aerial drones to monitor remote, lightly trafficked spots. The chief of the Border Patrol, Michael J. Fisher, said the goal of the strategy, begun a year ago, was to “shrink the border,” allowing agents to focus on areas where criminal smugglers of migrants and drugs were most likely to travel. The plan is to cover 900 miles, or 45 percent of the border, by 2016 with a “dense” array of agents and technology, and to monitor 1,092 miles, the other 55 percent, with “persistent surveillance” informed by drones, Mr. Fisher said. The report from Mr. Fisher and other top Homeland Security officials was eagerly received by hundreds of merchants who brought their wares to the Border Security Expo , a technology bazaar in the convention center here filled with darting robots, winged drones, high-powered microwave radios and video cameras that can peer over fences and through walls, day or night. House Republican leaders issued immigration principles in January saying that the United States had a “fundamental duty” to secure the border but was “failing in this mission.” Republicans have since said they were unlikely to take up immigration in the House this year. Last year, the Senate passed a comprehensive bill with a $40 billion increase for border spending. Homeland Security officials said they were not waiting for new action from Congress, which has nearly doubled the size of the Border Patrol since 2006 to more than 18,500 agents. “Some would suggest that you have to seal the border 100 percent, in which case we’re going to need thousands and thousands more Border Patrol agents and thousands and thousands more pieces of equipment,” Mr. Fisher said. “Even if our budgets could sustain it, which I suspect they cannot, we had to come up with an alternative plan this year.” Mr. Fisher said he had asked field commanders to identify areas across the rugged mountains and variable riverbeds of the border that were “low risk” because terrain or other factors made them hostile for people crossing illegally. He said 115 areas were identified, and Predator drones began last March to monitor them systematically to confirm there was no human movement. Image A Border Patrol agent at the expo. Part of a strategy on patrolling the border involves using aerial drones to monitor remote, lightly trafficked spots. Credit Samantha Sais for The New York Times If drones detect changes on the ground in those areas, a reconnaissance team is sent within 24 hours to determine whether there was an incursion, Mr. Fisher said. So far, detailed aerial images have been made of 388 miles of so-called low-risk border so that changes there can be rapidly noticed. In areas with higher traffic, agents patrol more frequently, backed up by surveillance towers, mobile spy systems, remote video cameras, hidden ground sensors and a host of other devices, some of them already proven in fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Such technology has been in use for several years near Tucson, until last year the busiest sector for illegal crossings. Now officials are gradually spreading it to other areas, particularly South Texas, where crossings are surging. In 2013, the Border Patrol made about 330,000 apprehensions at the southwest border, a third year at a low number not seen since the early 1970s. But almost all crossers were smuggled by criminal organizations that are also moving drugs and other contraband, officials said. As the authorities made it harder to move on the ground, smugglers dug tunnels under the line and sent ultralight aircraft to fly over it. Vendors in the vast display hall insisted they had answers. Qinetiq North America was offering a small robot that could scuttle into a makeshift tunnel to deactivate traps. AAI Corporation , in Maryland, had a drone, about 14 feet long, mounted with daylight and infrared cameras, just the thing for the aerial mapping that Mr. Fisher mentioned, said Jon Borcik, a representative. “It’s very covert,” Mr. Borcik said. “You really can’t see it in the air, and it’s a very quiet vehicle also.” Competition was intense to provide cameras mounted on collapsible towers that agents could carry in their pickup trucks. John Moulton, from Tactical Micro, in Virginia, had built a tower that could rise to 35 feet with a camera that could see six miles and a laser spotter that could pinpoint a person at more than eight miles. Homeland Security officials are still smarting from a disastrous border technology program started under President George W. Bush that cost more than $1.1 billion and produced very limited results. After three years of deliberations, last month the agency invested $23 million to purchase tall, fixed towers for cameras and other devices, the first such effort after the tower system failed in the earlier program. At least one vendor, ITC Manufacturing of Phoenix, was actually trying to sell the Border Patrol a fence. But that fence was made of thin bars of high-carbon steel set less than an inch apart, said Wayne Lyall of ITC, resistant to the most powerful bolt cutter. It did not look at all like the high metal barriers that lawmakers in Washington often evoke when demanding more security at the border.",

    "source": "Fugitive Kyrgyz President Warns of Bloodshed <eos> BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan — The provisional government that took power in Kyrgyzstan last week has drawn up plans to detain the country’s ousted president, a leader once close to the United States who fled a bloody riot in the capital to his ancestral homeland in the south of the country. The president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev , re-emerged in public from his compound in a southern village on Monday to hold a rally of about 500 people — and taunt the new leaders to try to arrest him. If they do, Mr. Bakiyev said, “there will be blood.” “Let them try to come and take me,” he told journalists after the rally. “Let them try to destroy me. There will be blood.” The announcement about the interim government’s arrest plan came in a news conference in the capital, Bishkek. Almazbek Atambayev, deputy head of the interim government, said that only concern for innocent bystanders was delaying security forces from swooping in and arresting Mr. Bakiyev. “These people are shielding themselves behind their countrymen, without conscience or honor,” Mr. Atambayev said. “We cannot allow innocent people to die again.” The fate of Mr. Bakiyev — openly defiant but apparently powerless — has been a source of tension around the country since he fled the capital last week after riot police officers opened fire on antigovernment demonstrators, provoking a violent backlash. In the last few days, he has been receiving journalists from his refuge at his compound in the southern mountains, in Teyit. “Of course we would like him to run someplace, anyplace,” Mr. Atambayev said, but no country has offered asylum. The new leaders had at first insisted the police would honor the president’s immunity from prosecution under the Kyrgyz Constitution, as he has not formally resigned his post. Roza Otunbayeva, the leader of the interim government, suggested Mr. Bakiyev should face an international tribunal, and raised the prospect in a meeting Saturday with a United Nations special envoy. On Monday, the United States Embassy in Bishkek issued a statement saying that it would play no role in resolving Mr. Bakiyev’s status. “The U.S. Embassy has no plans to shelter Mr. Bakiyev or help him leave Kyrgyzstan,” the embassy said. The embassy also said that the United States ambassador, Tatiana C. Gfoeller, met Monday with Ms. Otunbayeva, to express condolences over the loss of life last week. At the rally, Mr. Bakiyev repeated that he had no intention of surrendering. Still, he said he was open to negotiations with the interim government and renewed his call for an international commission to come to Kyrgyzstan to investigate last week’s violence. In a speech that evoked cheers and whistles from a crowd of mostly male supporters, Mr. Bakiyev continued to blame his opponents for the violence in Bishkek, which left more than 80 people dead, and recalled the largely peaceful coup in 2005 that ushered him into power. “That which happened in Bishkek was barbaric,” he told the crowd. “If I was guilty of this, I would have run away like the last president.” His supporters held blue and red signs saying “Keep your hands off the legitimate president” and “Youth for the legitimate president.” They accused the opposition of illegally usurping Mr. Bakiyev’s authority and vowed to defend him should any effort be made to arrest him. “We will never hand over the president,” said Pirimrul Sabirhanov, 40, a local businessman, calling the interim government “usurpers” and “criminals.” Like others, however, he said he was not prepared to turn to violence. “We won’t arm ourselves,” he said. “We won’t fight.” Mr. Bakiyev’s options are shrinking as more and more regional leaders voice support for the interim government or resign, as have some of the top officials in his own home region. Outside the capital, the American military resumed flying troops to and from Afghanistan through the Manas air base on Monday, after a brief halt because of the uprising, the United States Embassy said in a statement. Refueling flights had continued throughout the disturbance.",

    "source": "Senate Panel Rebuffed on Documents on U.S. Spying <eos> WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 - The Bush administration is rebuffing requests from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for its classified legal opinions on President Bush's domestic spying program, setting up a confrontation in advance of a hearing scheduled for next week, administration and Congressional officials said Wednesday. The Justice Department is balking at the request so far, administration officials said, arguing that the legal opinions would add little to the public debate because the administration has already laid out its legal defense at length in several public settings. But the legality of the program is known to have produced serious concerns within the Justice Department in 2004, at a time when one of the legal opinions was drafted. Democrats say they want to review the internal opinions to assess how legal thinking on the program evolved and whether lawyers in the department saw any concrete limits to the president's powers in fighting terrorism. With the committee scheduled to hold the first public hearing on the eavesdropping program on Monday, the Justice Department's stance could provoke another clash between Congress and the executive branch over access to classified internal documents. The administration has already drawn fire from Democrats in the last week for refusing to release internal documents on Hurricane Katrina as well as material related to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Several Democrats and at least one Republican have pressed the Justice Department in recent days to give them access, even in a closed setting, to the internal documents that formed the legal foundation of the surveillance program. But when asked whether the classified legal opinions would be made available to Congress, a senior Justice Department official said Wednesday, \"I don't think they're coming out.\" The official said the administration's legal arguments had already been aired, most prominently in a 42-page \"white paper\" issued last month. \"Everything that's in those memos was in the white paper,\" said the official, who, like other administration and Congressional officials, was granted anonymity because classified material was involved. While the administration has spent much of the last two weeks defending the legality and necessity of the surveillance program, the Judiciary Committee session will be the first Congressional hearing on it. Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who leads the panel, said Wednesday that he had \"a lot of questions\" the administration had not yet adequately answered about the program's legal rationale. Mr. Specter would not address the committee's request for the classified legal opinions, except to say, \"that's not a closed matter -- we're still working on that.\" Several Democrats on the panel have made formal requests for the legal opinions, including Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. In the interview, Mr. Specter said that he wanted a fuller explanation as to how the Justice Department asserts that the eavesdropping operation does not conflict with the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which set strict and \"exclusive\" guidelines for intelligence wiretaps. The operation was approved by President Bush, to allow the National Security Agency to conduct wiretaps on Americans' international communications without a court warrant. Mr. Specter said his view was that the operation \"violates FISA -- there's no doubt about that.\" He also questioned why the administration did not go to Congress or the intelligence court to seek changes in the process before moving ahead on its own with the classified program after the Sept. 11 attacks. Representative Jane Harman, the California Democrat who was one of the few members of the Congress briefed on the operation, echoed that same theme in a letter sent Wednesday to President Bush. She said in the letter that with changes made to the foreign intelligence law after the Sept. 11 attacks, the eavesdropping operations of the N.S.A. \"can and should\" be covered by court-approved warrants, \"without circumventing\" the process. Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales will be the lone witness at next week's hearing, and his aides said he was entering it with confidence about the program's legal footing, based on both the president's inherent constitutional authority and a Congressional authorization after the Sept. 11 attacks to use military force against terrorists. But both Republicans and Democrats said Wednesday that they planned to question Mr. Gonzales about those assertions. While the administration has laid out its legal defense repeatedly in the last two weeks, the formal legal opinions developed at the Justice Department to justify the program remain classified. The administration has refused even to publicly acknowledge the existence of the memorandums, but The New York Times has reported that two sets of legal opinions by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel asserted the president's broad power to order wiretaps without warrants in protecting national security. The first Justice Department opinion is thought to have been written in late 2001 or early 2002 by John Yoo, a strong proponent of expanded presidential powers in wartime. The second opinion, officials said, was drafted by Jack Goldsmith, another senior department official who later left to teach at Harvard. It came in 2004 at a time some senior officials at the Justice Department were voicing concerns about the program's legal foundation and refusing to sign off on its reauthorization. Those concerns led in part to the suspension of the surveillance program for several months and also appear to have led Mr. Goldsmith and other Justice Department lawyers to revisit the question of its legal underpinnings in order to satisfy those concerns. Members of the Judiciary Committee have sought access to the memorandums, officials said. Some Democrats speculate that the classified memos may contain far-reaching and potentially explosive legal theories similar to those advocated by Mr. Yoo and others, and later disavowed by the Justice Department, regarding policies on torture. In a letter sent Wednesday to Mr. Gonzales, Mrs. Feinstein said the legal opinions and other internal documents were needed for Congress to assess whether the president \"has the inherent authority to authorize this surveillance.\" With two additional hearings scheduled on the program after Mr. Gonzales's appearance, Mr. Specter said he was also considering seeking testimony from former Justice Department officials, and perhaps even input from the FISA court itself. But Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who also serves on the Judiciary Committee, said the panel should consider issuing subpoenas if the administration is not more forthcoming in providing documents and witnesses. \"Without the Justice Department memos and without more witnesses, it's hard to se how anything other than a rehashing of the administration line is going to happen,\" Mr. Schumer said Wednesday. \"I am worried that these hearings could end up telling us very little when the American people are thirsty to find out what happened here.\"",

    "source": "Familiar Pianist at Caramoor, and Beethoven’s Gravitational Pull <eos> As an 18-year-old student at the Curtis Institute of Music , Jonathan Biss had little professional experience when he took part in the rising-star residency for instrumentalists at the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts in Katonah in 1998. But those who recall the tall, dark pianist during his residency say he radiated self-assurance beyond his years. “I remember Jonathan as a very confident young man, almost cocky,” Paul Rosenblum, Caramoor’s longtime managing director, said as he sat in the center’s ornate Spanish courtyard on a sun-drenched day recently. “I asked him, ‘Do you intend to play a lot of chamber music?’ He said, ‘Sure, but I intend to have a concerto soloist career.’” And that is what Mr. Biss has done. Since his debut with the New York Philharmonic in 2001, he has played with nearly every major orchestra in the United States and Europe. He has also become a leading exponent of Beethoven, having begun a nine-year commitment to record all 32 of the composer’s sonatas and created a popular online course about them. All of that will inform Mr. Biss on his seventh trip to Caramoor, where he will be the artist in residence during the 71st summer festival. The residency will take place over three days, two of which will center on Beethoven — a decision that he said bordered on the inevitable, given his attraction to the composer and the freedom he enjoyed in programming the concerts. “I think of it more as a gravitational pull than a choice,” he said recently in his spartan Manhattan apartment. “There is something about Beethoven aside from the mastery of the music and the variety of expression. There is the force of his personality.” On July 10, he will play Beethoven’s Concerto No.2 with the Orchestra of St. Luke’s . The work, he said, is of particular interest because of its cadenza. Written about 20 years after the main work was completed, it proved to be the part of the piece that the composer Timo Andres focused on in “The Blind Banister,” a concerto written on Mr. Biss’s request as a kind of response to the Beethoven. “Banister,” which will have its New York premiere after the Beethoven concerto, is the first installment of Mr. Biss’s Beethoven/5 project, in which each of five composers produces a companion piece to one of the five Beethoven piano concertos. Caramoor commissioned “Banister” with St. Luke’s and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, which debuted the piece last November. Mr. Andres said he concentrated on the cadenza because of its contrast with the main piece, which is less reflective of the mature Beethoven’s potent style. “It was the revving up of those slightly different aesthetics against each other which set me off,” Mr. Andres said. He has created a work with a cadenza that, like Beethoven’s, manipulates the basic elements of his main concerto. But while he adopts some of Beethoven’s compositional techniques, his frame of reference is strictly contemporary — a strategy that the conductor, Joshua Weilerstein, said the orchestra would respect when interpreting the piece. “We’re going to take the language Timo writes in,” he said. Mr. Weilerstein will be the first American to conduct the work, which has been performed in Belfast, Ireland, as well as Saint Paul, Minn. Mr. Biss, who will perform “Banister” with the New York Philharmonic in April, found the cultural affinity worth noting. “Even though Timo’s influences are all over the map, somewhere in there he’s really American,” Mr. Biss said. “And I think Josh is also a product of this country. It will be interesting to work with someone who comes out of not so different a tradition.” Like Mr. Biss, Mr. Weilerstein has a history with Caramoor. In 2011, when he was barely a week into a three-year tenure as assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic, Mr. Weilerstein successfully stepped in for the conductor, Alan Gilbert, who was late for a concert at the Venetian Theater. Mr. Weilerstein is also connected to Caramoor through his sister, the cellist Alisa Weilerstein, a onetime participant in the rising-star program and the 2013 artist in residence. She will perform Bach’s cello suites in the Rosen House Music Room on Oct. 15. Family ties will also play a part when, on Aug. 4, Mr. Biss performs with his mother, the violinist Miriam Fried, in Janacek’s Sonata for Violin and Piano and Brahms’s Piano Quartet in A major. While they have never performed the Brahms together, neither expected a conflict on interpretation. “I wouldn’t pretend that we never fought, as mother and son, but we never ever had a disagreement when we worked together,” she said, echoing Mr. Biss’s sentiment. “There’s a different layer to the relationship of playing together that you can’t really duplicate with a colleague no matter how great they are.” The day after their performance, Mr. Biss will take a solo turn on four Beethoven sonatas. Among them is the “ Appassionata ,” which he said helped stoke his passion for Beethoven when, as a child, he became fascinated with a recording of it by Rudolf Serkin . “I felt like I was connected to it by some electric charge,” he said. The charge has not diminished over the years; he said he had probably performed the famously demanding and stormy sonata 100 times. At Caramoor, it will close out his residency. “There’s nothing to say after you’ve gone to hell,” he said. The “Appassionata” also figures in his internet lecture series, “Exploring Beethoven’s Sonatas,” which he said has been viewed by nearly 100,000 people. The course is offered by Coursera, an online service, through Curtis, where Mr. Biss, like Mr. Serkin before him, now teaches. He said he expected it to increase attendance at the Caramoor concerts. “Everywhere I go there are people who have seen it,” Mr. Biss said. “Hopefully, that portion of the audience already feels that they have a deeper relationship with me.”",

    "source": "North Carolina Pulls Away From Duke <eos> DURHAM , N.C. — Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski and his North Carolina counterpart, Roy Williams, managed to add even more fuel to one of the most intense rivalries in college sports with a public dispute last month over the disclosure of injuries, of all things. With these men’s basketball programs, it’s always something. Not that either side needed added inspiration when they met Saturday night at Cameron Indoor Stadium. At stake was the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season championship and the perks that come with it: the No. 1 seed in the upcoming A.C.C tournament and an expected local placing in the N.C.A.A. tournament. The spoils go to North Carolina, which beat Duke, 76-68, in a finish that will join the list of highlight-reel games that have marked this series. Tyler Hansbrough’s layup with 2 minutes 9 seconds to go broke a 68-68 tie and Ty Lawson added a pair of free throws and a crucial steal as No. 1 North Carolina (29-2) staved off a Duke comeback. Lawson missed a layup after his steal, but the ball was tipped in by Danny Green with 48 seconds to go for a decisive 6-point advantage. A dunk by Green sealed the victory as North Carolina scored 10 consecutive points to overcome a 2-point deficit in the final minutes, holding Duke scoreless over the final 5:41. Green, a reserve swingman, had 18 points and 7 blocked shots and Hansbrough added 16 points and 15 rebounds to pace North Carolina, which will be the top seed this week when the A.C.C. tournament opens in Charlotte , N.C. Although the seedings for the N.C.A.A. tournament will not be announced until next weekend, the winner of this game has the inside track on a No. 1 seed in that tournament, with first- and second-round games in nearby Raleigh , N.C., and the regional semifinals and finals in Charlotte. “I can’t really describe it,” Hansbrough said of Saturday night’s victory. “We’ve got a title, A.C.C. title we just won. Possibly No. 1 seed, really helped us. I think it showed that we’ve come a long way. “I think our team’s really coming together now.” Greg Paulus had 15 points for No. 6 Duke (26-4), which will have the No. 2 seed in the A.C.C. tournament. “Playing in a game like this and being in those situations, whether you hit or miss, is great experience for us,” Krzyzewski said. “We want to play in as many big games as we can.” The teams had come in with 13-2 records in the A.C.C., the fifth time in this series that the title had come down to the final game of the season. But that was not all that weighed on the Tar Heels. This had been an emotional week in Chapel Hill , 10 miles down the road from Duke. And for once, the teams set aside their rivalry long enough to stand on the court for a moment of silence to honor Eve Carson, the North Carolina student body president who was found shot to death near the campus early Wednesday morning. The Tar Heels, wearing an “EVE” patch on the shoulders of their jerseys, pulled to a 43-31 halftime lead as Green scored 14 points. Duke rallied in the second half and finally tied it on a 3-pointer by Jon Scheyer from the baseline with 9:45 to go. That set up a furious finish, with Scheyer’s layup finally giving Duke the lead, 68-66, with 5:42 to go. “We’ve been down plenty of times this year,” Green said. “We had to come back on a lot of teams. Nothing new to us. Just because they’re Duke doesn’t mean we can’t come back on them.” Duke had won the first game of the season series, 89-78, on Feb. 6 at the Dean Smith Center. But the Tar Heels were without Lawson, their starting point guard, who had a sprained ankle. Williams had openly discussed that injury and others on the team this season. So when Krzyzewski mentioned in a radio interview that he normally did not disclose injuries, Williams took that as a slight. On his own radio show, Williams declared that he did not care what others said and they should worry about their own teams. “I’ll coach my team,” he said. Lawson, back in the lineup although not 100 percent, had 10 points and 3 steals off the bench against Duke. NOTES Among the guests at Cameron were quarterbacks Eli and Peyton Manning. Both played college football under David Cutcliffe, the new coach at Duke. ... The former Duke basketball players Christian Laettner, Jay Williams and Chris Duhon also attended.",

The $200 PoGo camera is a follow-up to Polaroid’s PoGo Instant Mobile Printer, which appeared on store shelves in July. Like the printer, the combination device uses Zink printing technology, an inkless system that uses heat-activated dye crystals to produce an image in about 60 seconds. The photos have an adhesive backing, which enables them to double as stickers. The PoGo camera has a 3-inch LCD for reviewing images before you print. That is essential because the paper will set you back $12.99 for a pack of 30, or about 43 cents for each photo. The device looks a bit clunky but weighs only 10 ounces, which is pretty slight when you consider there is a printer inside.

Gepey was from Kirti Monastery in Sichuan Province, which is the epicenter of the wave of self-immolations that began in March 2011. Since then, at least 26 Tibetans have set fire to themselves across the Tibetan plateau, and at least 18 have died. Gepey committed self-immolation on the anniversary of an ill-fated Tibetan uprising against Chinese occupiers in 1959 that resulted in the Dalai Lama fleeing to India. Free Tibet said Gepey killed himself behind a military building in the town of Aba, known in Tibetan as Ngaba. He was the third Tibetan in a row to self-immolate by a building that symbolizes China ’s crackdown in Tibet , the group said. It added that security officers took away Gepey’s body, and the authorities did not allow traditional funeral rites to be performed for fear of the ceremony turning into a protest.",

    "source": "Afghans Say U.S. Raids Killed 30 Civilians <eos> KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — At least 30 civilians have been killed in bombing raids by United States forces in western Afghanistan during heavy fighting between Afghan troops and Taliban fighters, Afghan officials said Tuesday. Enraged villagers brought an estimated 30 bodies, including those of women and children, from their district to the capital of Farah Province to show officials, news agencies reported, quoting local officials. Villagers’ accounts put the death toll at 70 to 100, they said. If confirmed, the bombardment would be the largest case of civilian casualties since an attack on the village of Azizabad in western Afghanistan last year, in which United Nations officials said there was convincing evidence that 90 civilians were killed. The United States military only ever acknowledged that 30 civilians had died . The case led to stricter rules for calling in bombing raids on Afghan houses. The provincial governor for Farah Province, Rohul Amin, confirmed there had been heavy fighting and aerial bombardment in Bala Baluk, a district to the north of the province where Taliban and drug smugglers are active. He said that 25 to 30 Taliban had been killed and that there had also been civilian casualties. He said he was sending a government delegation to the area to investigate. The top United States spokesman in Afghanistan, Col. Greg Julian, confirmed that coalition forces had participated in the battle, The Associated Press reported. Colonel Julian said that several wounded Afghans had sought medical treatment at a military base in Farah, but that officials were still investigating the reports of civilian deaths. The Taliban had gathered in several villages named Shewan Kalai, Ganjabad, and Durani Kalai, in the Bala Baluk district, the governor said when contacted by phone. They attacked police checkpoints in the villages around midnight on Monday and the fighting steadily escalated. Three policemen were killed and three others wounded. Two police cars were set on fire and one was stolen. An Afghan Army unit was sent to the area, but found a heavy contingent of Taliban and later called in airstrikes. The Afghan Army has American trainers embedded with them who are able to call in air support. The fighting lasted about 12 hours through the night, the governor said. “We don’t know the exact numbers of the civilians’ casualties; it is a densely populated area where the fighting broke out,” the governor said. “The Taliban are using civilians’ houses for their own protection and as a shield,” he said. He said he would ask tribal elders to go to the region to investigate the villagers’ claims, because the area was too full of the Taliban for government officials to go there. Villagers told Afghan officials that they had put children, women, and elderly men in several housing compounds away from the fighting to keep them safe. But the villagers said fighter aircraft later attacked those compounds in the village of Gerani, killing a majority of those inside, The A.P. reported. Abdul Basir Khan, a member of Farah’s provincial council, said villagers had brought bodies, including women and children, to Farah city to show the province’s governor, The A.P. report said. Mr. Khan said it was difficult to count the bodies because they had been badly mutilated, but he estimated that the villagers brought around 30. Mohammad Nieem Qadderdan, the former top official in the district of Bala Baluk, said he had seen dozens of bodies when he visited the village of Gerani. “These houses that were full of children and women and elders were bombed by planes. It is very difficult to say how many were killed because nobody can count the number, it is too early,” Mr. Qadderdan, who no longer holds a government position, told The A.P. by telephone. “People are digging through rubble with shovels and hands.”",

    "source": "Twins Miss Morneau, Still Out with a Concussion <eos> MINNEAPOLIS — Nearly three months after sustaining a concussion in a game in Toronto, Justin Morneau often seems like a phantom. Minnesota Twins General Manager Bill Smith says he occasionally sees Morneau, the Twins’ four-time All-Star first baseman, running along the warning track at Target Field, foul pole to foul pole. And just about every day, Manager Ron Gardenhire says, Morneau takes batting practice in the indoor cages. But to almost everyone, except his teammates, Morneau sightings have been very limited. He sits in the dugout during home games. He appeared on the field briefly last Tuesday night to celebrate after the Twins clinched the American League Central division title. Lately, that has been about it. In managing Morneau’s recovery, the Twins stopped giving daily medical updates, Smith said, to discourage speculation about his progress or setbacks. They also shield him from members of the news media. Morneau last spoke to reporters on Sept. 8, when the Twins nominated him for Major League Baseball’s Roberto Clemente Award for community service. That day, a glassy-eyed Morneau said he was still symptomatic but remained hopeful he might return before the end of the season. Doctors treating Morneau are confident he will resume his career, Smith said. But no one knows exactly when that will be. The Twins appear to be proceeding as if Morneau will not be available when the playoffs begin next week, perhaps against the Yankees. “If he was ready, he would be out on the field hitting with us,” Gardenhire said last week. However, on Wednesday, before the Twins beat the Royals, 4-2, in Kansas City, Gardenhire offered a glimmer of hope, telling reporters that Morneau would work out with the Twins on Thursday, when they return to Target Field for a season-ending series with Toronto. But Gardenhire would not speculate whether Morneau could play at some point in the postseason. Smith and Gardenhire both say they no longer ask Morneau how he’s feeling. Both seem intent on not pressuring him into coming back too soon. Still, if Morneau does work out with the team Thursday, the question of how he feels will be front and center. The importance of being cautious will undoubtedly have to be re-emphasized. “Every one of us would love to have Justin Morneau in the lineup tonight,” Smith said last week. “But we’re not going to jeopardize Justin Morneau’s long-term health or his long-term career. If we have to wait two days or two weeks, we wait two days or two weeks. If we have to wait six months, we wait six months.” Among the major leaguers who sustained concussions this season — a list that includes St. Louis Cardinals catcher Jason LaRue, who has decided to retire, and Jason Bay of the Mets — Morneau is the biggest name. The 2006 A.L. most valuable player, Morneau was in the midst of another successful season (.345, 18 homers, 56 runs batted in) when he was accidentally kneed in the head by Toronto’s John McDonald on a takeout slide into second base on July 7. The Twins pulled Morneau out of the game immediately. He did not play the next day and accompanied the Twins to Detroit to be examined by Dr. Kenneth Podell, a neuropsychology consultant for the Detroit Lions and Red Wings. Podell sent him back to Minneapolis to rest. Smith said the Twins’ medical and training staffs took a greater interest in concussions after the plight of Corey Koskie, a longtime Twin who missed two and a half seasons with post-concussion syndrome, for an injury sustained with the Milwaukee Brewers, before retiring in March 2009. Koskie called Smith shortly after Morneau was examined and later talked to Morneau. The Twins already knew to be careful with Morneau, who had previously told the medical staff he sustained four head injuries playing basketball and hockey as a youngster. As a Twin, he missed 10 days with a concussion after a 2005 beaning. At first, Morneau said his symptoms were not as severe as in 2005. But they did not subside as quickly. He took batting practice on the field on Aug. 7, and there was talk he might soon begin a rehabilitation assignment. That did not happen. In late August, Morneau was told to cease baseball activities and concentrate on cardiovascular work at home. He quietly resumed hitting several weeks ago. Dr. Christopher Giza, an associate professor of pediatric neurology and neurosurgery at U.C.L.A., said the Twins had followed established guidelines in their treatment of Morneau. He said some patients with a history of head injuries did not recover quickly from another incident even if the initial symptoms, as in Morneau’s case, did not seem that severe. In an interview on Sept. 8, Morneau expressed frustration over sitting out for a second consecutive season. Last year, Morneau did not play after Sept. 12 because of a cracked bone in his lower back. The Twins won the A.L. Central but were swept by the Yankees in the playoffs. This season the Morneau-less Twins have compiled a 47-23 record in the second half. Among the keys to the surge have been a career season from left fielder Delmon Young (110 R.B.I.), unexpected production from the 40-year-old designated hitter Jim Thome (25 homers and a .280 average) and a .383 second half from Joe Mauer . “It seems like they play pretty good without him,” White Sox pitcher Mark Buehrle said of Morneau. “That’s the type of team they have. When one of their superstars goes down, even a great hitter like he is and defensive guy at first base, it seems like they have somebody to step right on in.” In the September interview, Morneau lamented his ongoing absence, saying, “You never know how many chances you’re going to get to win.” Michael Cuddyer, who missed more than two and a half months in 2008 with finger and foot injuries, said he understood Morneau’s frustration but could not offer him much comfort. “Automatically, if you’re not on the field, you’re going to feel like that,” said Cuddyer, who replaced Morneau at first base. “So you have to do stuff to make yourself feel like a part of it.” Morneau tries. On Sept. 17, when center fielder Denard Span reported a jammed shoulder, Morneau gave the minor league callup Ben Revere advance notice that he would be making his first major league start. Last Tuesday night, Morneau sprayed Champagne with teammates after the Twins clinched and carefully hugged the much smaller Span on the field. But he turned his head to avoid an accidental bump. Meanwhile, Gardenhire said he could not help but think how much more formidable the Twins would be with his phantom in the lineup. “I just wish I had my first baseman,” he said.",

    "source": "Former Liu Associates Are Sentenced <eos> Two former associates of John C. Liu, the New York City comptroller, managed to avoid lengthy prison sentences on Thursday for their roles in attempting to funnel money to Mr. Liu’s mayoral campaign through an illegal fund-raising scheme. Although Jia Hou, a former Liu campaign treasurer, and Xing Wu Pan, a fund-raiser, faced maximum sentences of 20 years on each of various counts, it was widely expected that the actual sentence would be far less severe. Both defendants’ lawyers had asked that their clients avoid prison, and prosecutors recommended a sentence of as much as 30 months for Ms. Hou, and half that for Mr. Pan. But in a Manhattan courtroom filled with the defendants’ supporters, the judge, Richard J. Sullivan of Federal District Court, sentenced Ms. Hou to 10 months and Mr. Pan to four. Afterward, Mr. Liu, who was not charged in the federal investigation into his campaign finances, which dated to 2009, sharply criticized the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, for prosecuting Ms. Hou, 27, who goes by the name Jenny, and Mr. Pan, who is known as Oliver and is in his 40s. “For reasons I may never fully understand,” Mr. Liu said, “the U.S. attorney’s office set out to destroy me with what has been described as an extraordinarily intrusive and exhaustive investigation.” He added: “Failing to find that I had done anything wrong, they proceeded to set up a weak man and a wonderful young woman. Jenny Hou does not deserve this ordeal and injustice she has been put through.” Mr. Bharara’s office declined to comment on Mr. Liu’s statement. Prosecutors had charged that Ms. Hou and Mr. Pan relied on so-called straw donors — people whose contributions are reimbursed by others — to raise money with the goal of obtaining city matching funds. Ms. Hou was acquitted of conspiracy but was convicted for her role in the straw-donor scheme. She was also found guilty of lying to federal agents and of obstruction of justice. Mr. Pan was found guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and of attempted wire fraud in relation to a straw-donor scheme. On Thursday, before they were sentenced, each defendant addressed Judge Sullivan. Mr. Pan, before he spoke, bowed deeply toward the judge, prosecutors and spectators. Ms. Hou also bowed, after she spoke, toward the judge, then toward her family and supporters in the gallery. Mr. Pan told the judge he now realized that “creating straw donors was totally wrong” and that he had learned “a valuable lesson.” Image Jia Hou, who worked for John C. Liu during his run for mayor of New York, was sentenced to 10 months in prison over a fund-raising scheme. Another defendant received four months. Credit John Marshall Mantel for The New York Times Ms. Hou wept at times as she read a statement. Throughout the case, she said, she had maintained her innocence. “I am not changing that position,” she continued. But she said that she had not been focused on seeking matching funds, and should have been more attentive than she was. “What I lacked was experience in life,” Ms. Hou said, adding that she had not had the judgment required to ask what was really going on. Judge Sullivan made it clear in court that he believed the defendants’ actions had subverted the electoral process and added to public cynicism. “What makes it a serious crime,” he said before sentencing Ms. Hou, “is the fact that it compromises and undermines the institution of free elections,” which he said was essential “to our system of government.” He also cited Ms. Hou’s obstruction and lying convictions, saying the justice system depended on people providing truthful information. Judge Sullivan said that he did not doubt Ms. Hou had been thrust into a difficult situation. “It’s not a crime to be overwhelmed,” he said. “It’s not a crime to be naïve and lack life experience.” But that was “not what the jury convicted you of,” he said. “They convicted you of fraud.” Ms. Hou’s lawyer, Gerald B. Lefcourt, and Mr. Pan’s lawyer, Irwin Rochman, both said their clients, who are to surrender later this year, would appeal. Throughout the trial, the prosecutors, Brian A. Jacobs and Justin Anderson, sought to portray the Liu campaign as condoning, if not orchestrating outright, questionable practices intended to maximize fund-raising, and suggested that the defendants’ actions fit into a larger pattern. Mr. Anderson said in a closing argument that Mr. Liu must have known about the scheme, an assertion his lawyer, Paul Shechtman, has steadfastly rejected. Mr. Liu, who finished fourth in the Democratic primary for mayor, was not in court on Thursday. After the trial ended on May 2, he said that he was “deeply saddened” by the verdict and was proud of how his campaign had been conducted. He expressed a similar sentiment on Thursday. “I am very sad but even more angry at what has occurred,” he said. “The U.S. attorney’s office was wrong and should not be proud of its conduct.”",

    "source": "After Revelation He Had C.T.E., Ken Stabler Is a Poignant Hall of Fame Addition <eos> While generally a cause for celebration, Saturday’s announcement of the class of 2016 for the Pro Football Hall of Fame carried a somber tone as Ken Stabler, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback for the Oakland Raiders, was elected days after it was publicly revealed that he had had Stage 3 chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease, before his death in July. Stabler, known as the Snake, who won a Most Valuable Player Award for the 1974 season and led the Raiders to the team’s first Super Bowl victory after the 1976 season, was previously a finalist for election three times, but this year, as a senior candidate, he was elected alongside Dick Stanfel, a star offensive lineman in the 1950s. The modern-era electees were Brett Favre, Marvin Harrison, Kevin Greene, Orlando Pace and Tony Dungy, as well as Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., who owned the San Francisco 49ers for all five of their Super Bowl wins and was elected as a contributor. Video The family of Ken Stabler, the former Raiders quarterback who died in July at age 69, speaks about his life and the effects of C.T.E., which was diagnosed posthumously. Credit Credit Al Messerschmidt/Associated Press Stabler was represented at the announcement by his grandsons, Justin and Jack Moyes. “He was just special,” Justin Moyes said of Stabler. “He loved football, and that was life for him.” Stabler’s election came a year after Junior Seau, a star linebacker for the San Diego Chargers and the New England Patriots, was elected. Seau committed suicide in 2012, and it was subsequently revealed that he, too, had had C.T.E. While Stabler’s career totals may appear modest by today’s standards, he enjoyed a dominant prime with the Raiders and the Houston Oilers, and his antics off the field were immortalized in his autobiography, “Snake,” a vivid portrayal of the N.F.L. in the 1970s. Although Stabler threw more interceptions than touchdown passes during the course of his career, at the time of his death, John Madden, his longtime coach in Oakland, paid him perhaps the ultimate tribute. “I’ve often said, if I had one drive to win a game to this day, I would pick Kenny,” Madden told reporters. “Snake was a lot cooler than I was. He was a perfect quarterback and a perfect Raider. When you think about Kenny, you think about the Raiders.” The players will be formally enshrined in the Hall of Fame on Aug. 6 at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio.",

The skirt had blood on it, she said, because “I’d fought in it three days before and gotten a head butt that needed stitches.” Months before the storm, she and her daughter, Annie, 9, had lost most of their belongings in an apartment fire. The flood, which destroyed her parents’ house — along with others in their working-class neighborhood — took almost everything else. But not the skirt. “I couldn’t get rid of it,” she said. “It was my debut skirt from my first professional fight.” After years of struggle, Ms. Hardy is a rising force in professional boxing and has become a source of pride in Gerritsen Beach, the tightknit Brooklyn neighborhood where her family’s roots stretch back six generations. She did not walk into a boxing gym until 2010, but has won all nine of her pro fights, the Universal Boxing Federation international super bantamweight title, a 2011 national championship and a 2012 Golden Gloves award. She is the first woman to sign a long-term promotional deal with Lou DiBella, a high-profile boxing promoter with a roster of top-ranked male boxers. In the ring, the petite, 5-foot-5 boxer is a formidable brawler, wearing the colors of Ireland and two blond braids. “I’m not a pretty fighter,” she said. “I fight like a boy.” She is intent on putting on a good show: People may come to see the male headliner, “but I have to make them remember the girl,” she said. Her fans, especially those from Gerritsen Beach, are passionate at her fights. Celebrities — including 50 Cent, Rosie Perez and Susan Sarandon — have been in the audience. Ms. Hardy is among a growing number of female boxers carving out space in a male-dominated sport. But it is not easy. “They don’t get equal pay,” said Bruce Silverglade, 67, the owner of Gleason’s Gym in Brooklyn, who has encouraged Ms. Hardy and other female fighters. Even at the top, women make only about $1,000 a round. And “women have a much harder time getting fights,” Mr. Silverglade said. “In the general population, there’s still a feeling — women shouldn’t be boxing.” Despite her success, much remains the same for Ms. Hardy. She still starts working out at Gleason’s Gym at 6 a.m., with her trainer and mentor, Devon Cormack, 55, a soft-spoken former kickboxing champion. She still hustles to sell tickets to her fights. She still trains clients so that she can pay her rent. Until a few months ago, she got up before dawn to take a bus and two subway trains to Gleason’s. She hated being away from Annie, sometimes 15 hours a day. In their new apartment in Dumbo, near the gym, she sleeps on the couch. Annie has the bedroom. Ms. Hardy was driven even as a girl. Her family has lived in a series of bungalows in Gerritsen Beach, the predominantly Irish enclave between Sheepshead Bay and Marine Park, since her great-great-grandmother emigrated from Scotland in 1929. She got top grades in school. “If there was something she wanted,” said her aunt, Karen Bianco, 47, “she wouldn’t ask, ‘Can I have, can I have?’ She’d work for it.” Ms. Hardy is proud of where she came from. “We’re all family,” she said. “Gerritsen Beach’s motto is: ‘You help the ones you love, and then you help the ones you hate.’ ” That explains why the devastated community mobilized so quickly after the hurricane. And why the local church, where her father is a longtime volunteer, has given her parents a place to live as their house is being rebuilt. Yet the seaside blocks, where families have known one another for generations, can feel insular. Early on, “I wanted to get out,” Ms. Hardy said, having been determined to avoid a well-worn neighborhood path. “You get out of high school, you have a kid, you get married,” she said. “Then you get a job and wait for your parents to die so you can move into their home.” College seemed a way out, and she attended the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. “I felt really fortunate,” she said. “I had a vision of a bigger picture.” But after graduating at 22, with a major in forensic psychology, she got pregnant and married her childhood sweetheart, who worked for the Sanitation Department. “I felt like a guy in a dress,” she said about her years as a wife and a mother at home in Gerritsen Beach. During a painful divorce, she worked multiple jobs to support herself and Annie. She did some kickboxing as a creative outlet, then stopped for lack of money. “For about a year, I did nothing,” she said. “I found myself completely lost.” She decided to try Gleason’s. Sparring in the legendary old gym, she felt an immediate jolt. “Boxing was the only thing that felt completely mine,” she said. “When you find something you love, you don’t want to do it just a little bit.” Mr. Cormack took notice. “I saw something in her,” he said. “She was making mistakes, but giving 150 percent, just nonstop effort.” Ms. Hardy initially trained with Mr. Cormack’s younger sister, Alicia Ashley, a World Boxing Council world champion he had trained. “But I kept losing,” Ms. Hardy said. The night of her second amateur loss, Mr. Cormack ended up working her corner. “I said, ‘Dev, I don’t want to lose anymore.’ He said ‘O.K.’ and took me as his project.” He and Ms. Hardy are tied at the hip. “We’re together in everything,” Ms. Hardy said, explaining that even their money is pooled. Mr. Cormack helps her out with living expenses. “I know other fighters, married to their trainers. We’re not, but we might as well be.” Her ties to Gerritsen Beach remain tight, but “it’s a relief to be out,” Ms. Hardy said. “I get to be around Annie all the time.” After she picks her daughter up at school, they walk to Gleason’s, where Annie does homework and plays with a hula hoop. “I make my mom bring me groceries from our neighborhood,” Ms. Hardy added, smiling. “Everything is so expensive here.” In Gerritsen Beach, Ms. Hardy had worried, what if Annie doesn’t get to see a bigger picture? “I didn’t want to be another generation passing along my parents’ house,” she said. At her new school, “Annie’s learning ‘good morning’ in 30, 40 languages.”",

    "source": "Complaints Rise as Bike Share Program Nears <eos> Bike share was easy for New York City to love in the abstract. It was not about adding bike lanes at the expense of something else; it was about sharing something that did not yet exist. But with the program two weeks away, many New Yorkers have turned against bike share, and for one simple reason: They did not expect it to look like this. In recent weeks, hundreds of stations have sprouted in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn — empty husks sprawled 30 or 50 spaces long on city sidewalks and streets, anticipating rows of bicycles that will soon protrude from the kiosk slots. The critics say the kiosks are a blight. They clash with the character of residential areas of the West Village or Fort Greene, Brooklyn. They are already magnets for pigeons, garbage bags and dogs in need of relief. Lawsuits have been prepared. Kiosks have been defaced. At one community meeting, an inelegant analogy was drawn between the Bloomberg administration and the Taliban. “None of us are against bikes — most of us have bikes that we stow in our building,” said Lynn Ellsworth, 54, from TriBeCa. “But why they put these giant racks in these little streets is crazy to me.” Many opponents knew that the rental bikes were coming — thousands of them, made available for public use — and they understood that the city would need somewhere to put them . But there was initially little uproar, nothing to match what greeted the expansion of bike lanes, a flash point of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s transportation legacy. Image Some neighbors want to get rid of a kiosk near Petrosino Square in Manhattan; bicycling advocates are encouraging residents to attend a community meeting. Credit Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times Indeed, a poll by The New York Times last year found broad support for cycling, with 66 percent of respondents calling bike lanes a good idea. Eleven percent of those polled said they were very likely to use bike share; 19 percent said they were somewhat likely. Now, even some avid cyclists have found occasion to complain. At a recent community meeting on bike share in the West Village, Jane Browne, 42, who initially supported the program, said she had recently seen mice scurrying in the “corridors of trash and water” that formed between a nearby bike station and the curb. Shelly Mossey, 58, from Battery Park City, has protested the planned removal of a widely used rack for private bikes near South End Avenue, calling it a pillar of the neighborhood. His son’s bike is on there, he said, and so are his peers’. Families mingle at the rack before retrieving their bikes and escorting their children to school. “Why do we have to lose that,” Mr. Mossey asked, “and give it up for the bigger picture?” Other residents have rebelled against the program’s sponsor , Citibank, whose logo on bike kiosks prompted vandals in Fort Greene to post fliers at the stations. They read, in all capital letters, “Residential landmark blocks are not for advertising or commercial activity!” The city’s Transportation Department said it had been warned of possible problems ahead by aides of Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, where a bike share program began in 2010. “They said you’ll be hated for six months,” Jon Orcutt, the department’s policy director, recalled, “and then you’ll be loved.” Image A bike share kiosk at the edge of a park on Lafayette Street in Manhattan. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times Still, the Bloomberg administration had hoped to pre-empt some of the discontent. In a report timed weeks before the first Brooklyn stations were installed, the city said that community participation in the program’s planning had outstripped “any other public project undertaken anywhere.” The city said it had discussed the bike share program at 159 public meetings, and conducted 230 more with elected officials, property owners and other stakeholders. Planners received more than 10,000 suggestions for station locations online. But city officials, advocates and adversaries alike now concede that no amount of forewarning could have prepared residents for the sight of the stations. “People are attached to their streets,” said Paul Steely White, the executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group that has been among the program’s greatest cheerleaders. “When someone changes it, it’s like someone rearranging the furniture in our living room.” Some neighborhood grievances have been predictable : complaints of lost parking and reckless riding, often from those who opposed cycling’s expansion in the city long before bike share. Resident groups that have threatened legal action against the city over station locations in Manhattan — including groups from an apartment building at 99 Bank Street in the West Village and from a luxury condominium on East 55th Street — are seen as unlikely to affect the program’s introduction. Despite that, Mitchell Moss, the director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University, said the station debate provided a more vexing test for the city than the debate over bike lanes, in part because “a car is not as sympathetic as a resident.” Image The bike kiosk and docks at Liberty and Broadway in Manhattan. Credit Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times “You don’t know where a bike stand is until you see it,” he said. “The problem is not that people weren’t informed. It’s the critical mass of the bike stands that has the impact.” The bike share program, which is to begin Memorial Day, will initially include roughly 330 stations and 6,000 bikes. For a $95 annual membership, before tax, New Yorkers can rent bikes for as long as 45 minutes without an additional charge. Mr. Orcutt said most of the more than 200 stations installed had so far been constructed without incident. “Washington had at least one fistfight at a community meeting,” he said. “We haven’t had that.” (An official with Washington’s Transportation Department said she did not recall any contentious community meetings or significant opposition to the program.) Mr. Orcutt added that some neighborhood concerns — worries of restricted access to transit system stairwells, or of impediments to firefighters or sanitation workers trying to reach buildings efficiently — were largely unfounded. Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Sanitation Department officials said they had not flagged any troublesome station locations. But Jim Long, a Fire Department spokesman, said that transportation officials had not “consulted with the Fire Department” as stations were installed, though he added that in many cases, there had been probably no need for the agencies to communicate because a location posed no risk to fire operations. (The Transportation Department said it had solicited input from the Fire Department before stations were placed, though it was unclear if or how that feedback had been used.) But bike share advocates say the new additions will soon blend in with the scenery, appearing as native to the sidewalks as bus shelters or subway entrances. On Lafayette Street recently, where a 55-bike station has been assembled near Astor Place, a couple leaned on the kiosk as if it were a well-worn city bench, plotting their next move with their daughter waiting in her stroller. Nearby, on University Place, Alfred Haffenden, 71, sat between a bike station and his table of available consumer items — two Al Franken books, a baby-care advice book and VHS copies of “The Shawshank Redemption” and “Wuthering Heights.” The stations would be a change, he said, but who would want to live in a New York that refused to try something new? “There’s not much you can do about that type, my friend,” he said, leaning toward the kiosk. “Some people can’t see. Some people just don’t want to see.”",

    "source": "Hackers Defend WikiLeaks, Testing Online Speech <eos> A hacking free-for-all has exploded on the Web, and Facebook and Twitter are stuck in the middle. On Wednesday, anonymous hackers took aim at companies perceived to have harmed WikiLeaks after its release of a flood of confidential diplomatic documents. MasterCard , Visa and PayPal, which had cut off people’s ability to donate money to WikiLeaks, were hit by attacks that tried to block access to the companies’ Web sites and services. To organize their efforts, the hackers have turned to sites like Facebook and Twitter. That has drawn these Web giants into the fray and created a precarious situation for them. Both Facebook and Twitter — but particularly Twitter — have received praise in recent years as outlets for free speech. Governments trying to control the flow of information have found it difficult to block people from voicing their concerns or setting up meetings through the sites. At the same time, both Facebook and Twitter have corporate aspirations that hinge on their ability to serve as ad platforms for other companies. This leaves them with tough public relations and business decisions around how they should handle situations as politically charged as the WikiLeaks developments. Some internet experts say the situation highlights the complexities of free speech issues on the Internet, as grassroots Web companies evolve and take central control over what their users can make public. Clay Shirky, who studies the Internet and teaches at New York University , said that although the Web is the new public sphere, it is actually “a corporate sphere that tolerates public speech.” Marcia Hofmann, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said, “Any Internet user who cares about free speech or has a controversial or unpopular message should be concerned about the fact that intermediaries might not let them express it.” She added, “Your free speech rights are only as strong as the weakest intermediary.” The problem came into relief on Wednesday, through an effort called Operation Payback, organized by a group calling itself Anonymous. The group spent much of the day posting notes on Facebook and Twitter that told followers which companies to single out and that documented hacking successes. But Facebook banned one of the group’s pages, saying that using the site to organize hacking attacks like that violated its terms of use. The group went on Twitter to complain. A Facebook spokesman issued a statement saying that the company was “sensitive to content that includes pornography, bullying, hate speech, and threats of violence” and would “take action on content that we find or that’s reported to us that promotes unlawful activity.” In an interview Wednesday morning, Joe Sullivan, Facebook’s chief security officer, addressed WikiLeaks’s own presence on the site. He said the company had not received any official requests to disable pages or accounts associated with the WikiLeaks organization. Facebook generally resists requests by governments or advocacy groups to take down material if that content is not illegal or does not violate Facebook’s terms of service, which prohibit attacks on individuals or incitements to violence. “Facebook is a place where people come to talk about all sorts of things, including controversial topics,” Mr. Sullivan said. It was not clear whether anyone had asked Facebook to take down the Operation Payback page. Twitter allowed the Operation Payback account to stay active most of Wednesday. But the group’s account was disabled late in the day, after it posted a link to a file that provided thousands of consumer credit card numbers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. A Twitter spokesman declined to discuss the details of the situation. “We don’t comment about the specific actions we take around user accounts,” he said. The company is not overly concerned about hackers’ attacking Twitter’s site, he said, explaining that it faces security issues all the time and has technology to deal with the situation. Twitter is in a particularly delicate situation because its founders have celebrated their service’s role in political protest and free speech. They have not been shy about trying to capitalize on the good will engendered by playing that role. WikiLeaks’s own Twitter account remains active, and it is the group’s main channel for reaching supporters and the media. Last week, Amazon.com fell into a similar position when it decided to stop storing files for WikiLeaks. Advocates of WikiLeaks complained that Amazon.com was bowing to political pressure to cut the organization from its Web services. An Amazon.com spokesman said the company was simply banning an organization that had violated its terms of service by trying to distribute documents it did not own. The last week has given rise to a hacking war in which groups have blocked access to WikiLeaks’s Web sites by bombarding them with requests. And now the WikiLeaks supporters have responded in kind, flying the freedom of speech banner as the motivation for their actions.",

    "source": "Supreme Court Weighs Revisions in Cocaine-Case Sentences <eos> WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday about an aspect of one of the greatest controversies in American criminal law: the differing treatment of crack and powder cocaine. “I’ve been a judge for nearly 20 years,” said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the only member of the current court who has served as a trial judge, “and I don’t know that there’s one law that has created more controversy or more discussion about its racial impact than this one.” Crack and powder cocaine are two forms of the same drug. But, until recently, a drug dealer selling crack cocaine was subject to the same sentence as one selling 100 times as much powder. In 2010, Congress enacted the Fair Sentencing Act , which reduced the disparity to 18 to 1, at least for people who committed their crimes after the law became effective that Aug. 3 . That means many defendants caught with small amounts of crack are no longer subject to mandatory 5- or 10-year prison sentences. The question on Tuesday was whether the new, lesser punishments also applied to people who committed crimes before the law became effective but were not sentenced until afterward. The usual rule, set out in an 1871 law, is that new laws do not apply retroactively unless Congress expressly says so. Here Congress said nothing, or at least nothing in so many words. It did instruct the United States Sentencing Commission to act quickly to revise its discretionary sentencing guidelines to reflect the new ratios. Early in the argument, several justices suggested that the 1871 law might pose an insurmountable barrier to defendants who sold cocaine before August 2010. Congress must have known, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said, that the 1871 law “required an express statement if they wanted to apply the change retroactively.” “So why shouldn’t we hold them to that standard?” he asked. As the argument went on, the justices’ attention seemed to turn to a question posed by a lawyer for the two men whose cases were before them. “Why would Congress want district courts to continue to impose sentences that were universally viewed as unfair and racially discriminatory?” the lawyer, Stephen E. Eberhardt, asked. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy seemed sympathetic to trial judges called on to sentence defendants under the old law. Many such judges have expressed anger over the issue. “One of the hardest things is sentencing,” Justice Kennedy said. “And you’re saying that a sentencing judge who knows the law has been changed, who knows the law has been criticized, is nevertheless bound and determined that it’s fair for this person to be sentenced to the longer term.” The Justice Department had initially supported a strict reading of the 1871 law. It revised its position last July, and a lawyer for the federal government, Michael R. Dreeben, argued in support of leniency on Tuesday. Under the stricter rule, he said, “there will probably be thousands of crack defendants who will be sentenced under the old mandatory minimums that Congress repealed because they were perceived as being racially disparate and unfair.” He added: “I think everyone in Congress understood that these guidelines had undermined the credibility of the criminal justice system for years.” Since both the government and the defendants agreed that the recent law may be applied retroactively to those sentenced after 2010, the Supreme Court appointed Miguel A. Estrada, a prominent Washington lawyer, to argue the other side. “I think this is a difficult case for public policy,” he told the justices, “but is not a difficult case for legal doctrine.” He added that if Congress had truly meant to undo a racially discriminatory policy it would not have stopped with defendants not yet sentenced. Many prisoners are serving long sentences under the old law, he said, and yet neither the defendants nor the government have argued for altering those punishments. Justice Antonin Scalia picked up on the point. “I would find that extraordinary, that they say it’s racist but we are going to leave in effect all of the sentences that have previously been imposed,” he said. The cases heard Tuesday were Dorsey v. United States, No. 11-5683, and Hill v. United States, No. 11-5721.",

    "source": "Immigration Debate Defines G.O.P. Race in California <eos> IRVINE, Calif. — Meg Whitman was almost at the end of a 30-minute town hall-style meeting here, responding to questions about taxes and spending, schools and unemployment. But one topic had not come up, so Ms. Whitman, a Republican candidate for governor, raised it herself, serving up a stern attack against illegal immigration and a promise that she would protect California’s borders. “I am 100 percent against amnesty,” Ms. Whitman proclaimed. “My Republican opponent says I’m for amnesty. That is absolutely not true.” For almost a year, Ms. Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay, has campaigned on three issues: jobs, education and government spending. But as her contest for the Republican nomination for governor against Steve Poizner , the state insurance commissioner, enters its final days, she has found herself drawn into a loud and caustic argument over immigration policy. “It is the only issue,” said Stuart Stevens, Mr. Poizner’s chief campaign consultant. The primary here on Tuesday will be the highest-stakes electoral contest since Arizona approved a tough immigration law, and that has allowed Mr. Poizner to reshape the campaign, focusing a series of stark attacks on Ms. Whitman. The extent to which immigration has, in the view of many Republicans, hijacked this contest has stirred worry that the nominee chosen next week will be weakened in the general election against Jerry Brown, a Democrat and former governor. “There’s a difference between talking about a problem and trying to exploit the problem as a wedge issue to try to get scared white voters,” said Allan Hoffenblum , a Republican analyst here. “I’m not speaking as a lone wolf on this in the Republican Party. It’s concerning a lot of us.” Hispanics are becoming increasingly influential in California politics. One in six voters this November is expected to be Hispanic — a proportion that is likely to grow in coming years — and Southern California has been at the forefront of efforts to boycott Arizona for enacting tough anti-immigrant legislation in late April. In many ways, California’s primary race offers a worrisome preview of what many Republicans say are the political perils for the party nationally in being identified with tough immigration policies. Mr. Poizner has enthusiastically endorsed such policies in his campaign. His series of stark television advertisements portraying Ms. Whitman as an advocate of permissive immigration began three weeks ago. The emphasis on immigration is striking in a state that is reeling from the economic downturn and saddled with what officials in both parties view as a dysfunctional government. At 12.5 percent, the unemployment rate here is far above the national average. The state has been hit hard by the foreclosure crisis, its public education system is a shambles, and disapproval of the Legislature and of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican barred by term limits from seeking re-election, are at near-record highs. The election is playing out against the backdrop of the latest battle in Sacramento over proposed cuts in spending to balance the budget. One strain on the state’s finances is providing social services to a large population of illegal immigrants, which is one reason the issue has political resonance. Still, it is hardly clear that the tough-on-immigrants stance has universal appeal among Republican voters; in the Central Valley, for instance, many farmers use undocumented farm workers. A Los Angeles Times/U.S.C. poll published on Sunday showed Ms. Whitman leading Mr. Poizner by 53 percent to 29 percent; other polls taken last month, after Mr. Poizner began his advertising assault against Ms. Whitman, showed that he had significantly tightened the race, until she started pushing back. In an interview, Ms. Whitman — who has been running advertisements promising to be “tough as nails” on illegal immigration — said that she thought voters were concerned about other things besides immigration, and that she was raising the issue only in response to what she asserted were Mr. Poizner’s distortions of her record. She said Mr. Poizner had hurt himself as a general election candidate because of the tenor of his attacks. “I think he’s damaged in the general because he’s only talked about one issue,” Ms. Whitman said. “And I think that’s a big mistake.” Mr. Poizner said that illegal immigration was “part and parcel of our message from the get-go” and that he always viewed it as the No. 1 issue for Republican primary voters, and a point of contrast with Ms. Whitman. “It’s huge: everywhere I go, people burst out into applause when I start talking about it,” Mr. Poizner said after appearing at a town hall-style meeting in El Segundo flanked by bright red screens with white lettering proclaiming, “No Amnesty: Stop Illegal Immigration.” “Our positions are just different,” he continued. “Meg Whitman opposes Arizona. I fully support it. In fact, I don’t see how you can be a Republican running for high office in the United States and be taken seriously if you oppose what’s going on in Arizona.” Both candidates are independently wealthy and together have spent more than $100 million — about $80 million for Ms. Whitman, and $25 million for Mr. Poizner — which has guaranteed a wide audience for the back-and-forth volley of television advertisements, radio spots and mailers. The demonstrated willingness of Ms. Whitman and Mr. Poizner to tap their own political fortunes to win the governorship is one of the key reasons Republicans are hopeful about defeating Mr. Brown. Even without immigration, candidates this primary season face a politically daunting task in trying to navigate an increasingly conservative Republican base and emerge as a viable candidate in the general election. Mark Baldassare , president and chief executive of the Public Policy Institute of California , a policy study and polling group, said that 75 percent of Republicans statewide disapproved of President Obama in a poll earlier last month, compared with 39 percent of all registered voters in California. “The Republican primary voters are not representative of the overall mood of Californians,” Mr. Baldassare said. “This is really a unique slice of the electorate.” One sign of this is the extent to which both Ms. Whitman and Mr. Poizner are critical of Mr. Schwarzenegger. Mr. Poizner said he would not want the governor to campaign with him should he win the nomination. “I think it would be better if he just stays out of the primary and the general election,” he said. Ron Nehring , the chairman of the state Republican Party, said the severity of the economic problems facing California would overshadow the immigration stances taken by the Republican candidate during the primaries. “The Democrats are always trying to paint Republicans as anti-immigrant,” he said. “But the first, second, third and fourth issue in the race for governor is jobs and the economy.” Ms. Whitman’s advisers said that if she won the nomination, she would move away from immigration to broaden her appeal. But Mr. Poizner said he would not change his campaign a bit. “This is important for everyone to know: What you see is what you get,” he said. “The campaign I’m waging now in the primary is exactly the same campaign I’ll be waging in the general against Jerry Brown. I think it’s a myth that independents, Democrats, these groups that supposedly would object to my strong positions on illegal immigration — uh-uh.”",

    "source": "Hong Kong Plan to Limit Public Data on Directors Put on Hold <eos> HONG KONG — The Hong Kong government said late Thursday, just before the start of a four-day Easter public holiday, that it had put on hold its plans to block public access to residential address information and the identity card numbers or passport numbers of company directors. The decision by the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau represents a sharp reversal of what had been portrayed by the government as an attempt to protect privacy. But the proposed policy drew criticism from bankers, corporate lawyers, accountants and journalists. They assailed the plan as a retreat from corporate transparency that would damage Hong Kong’s position as a financial center and could facilitate money laundering and other criminal activity. Hong Kong makes it extremely easy to set up companies, so many individuals create them, even simply to own their residences. Extensive data are available only from the Companies Registry, which has long been open to the public, including online, although fees are charged for documents. Many wealthy mainland Chinese, including from prominent Communist Party families, own companies in Hong Kong and have provided personal information to the Companies Registry. Banks, law firms and accounting firms routinely check the registry and gather data on mainland Chinese citizens to verify identities and detect fraud in initial public offerings and other transactions. The Financial Services and Treasury Bureau said it would proceed this year with a long-planned rewrite of the city’s Companies Ordinance, but the rewrite would not include the contested provision to limit public access. “Given the complexity of the issues involved and very diverse views of different stakeholders, we believe that the community should be given more time to build consensus on the issue” of public access, the bureau said in a statement sent to the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Hong Kong, which was one of the groups that had protested the proposed curbs on public access.",

    "source": "Republicans Nominate Paul Ryan as House Speaker <eos> WASHINGTON — House Republicans on Wednesday nominated Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin to be the 62nd speaker of the House, turning to the young chairman of the Ways and Means Committee to replace John A. Boehner of Ohio, who was driven into retirement by an angry uprising of conservative hard-liners. Mr. Ryan, an architect of sweeping budget and tax reform proposals who gained national prominence as the Republican Party’s 2012 vice-presidential nominee, won the overwhelming support of his colleagues in the nominating contest and is now set to be installed as speaker in a formal vote on the House floor on Thursday. Republicans said the vote was 200 to 43 over Representative Daniel Webster of Florida, Mr. Ryan’s closest rival. Although Mr. Ryan was short of the 218 votes needed to win Thursday’s floor vote, supporters said he would pick up backers now that he is the nominee. “Anything over 218 wins, I think we’ll be well above that,” said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma. In reluctantly accepting the gavel, the lanky Mr. Ryan, 45, will be tasked with healing the bitter divisions that have bedeviled House Republicans from virtually the moment they reclaimed the majority in the midterm elections of 2010. Seven Notable Speakers and Their Legacies Often called the second most powerful job in Washington, the position of speaker of the House comes with a vast array of responsibilities and daily duties. As Representative Paul D. Ryan prepares to take the helm, here is a look back at how some speakers fulfilled their charge as dictated by House rules, years of tradition and changing political realities. “This begins a new day in the House of Representatives,” Mr. Ryan told reporters on Wednesday after the vote. “We are not going to have a House that looked like it did the last few years. We are going to unify. We are going to respect the people by representing the people.” Rank-and-file conservatives, including the rebellious hard-liners of the House Freedom Caucus, had long complained that Mr. Boehner was too conciliatory in negotiations with President Obama and congressional Democrats. They also complained that Mr. Boehner did not give them enough say in the running of the House, and demanded changes. On Wednesday afternoon, the House was scheduled to vote on a bipartisan budget agreement, negotiated by Mr. Boehner, that Mr. Ryan has criticized but that would nonetheless allow him to take the speaker’s chair with a clean slate. The bill sets spending limits for the next two years, and raises the federal borrowing limit through March 2017 — essentially eliminating the risk of a government shutdown or a debt default through the end of Mr. Obama’s second term. Still, other challenges loom. Most immediately, some crucial highway programs are due to expire next month. And the budget agreement must now go through the appropriations process, where contentious issues are almost certain to arise. After Mr. Boehner unexpectedly announced his retirement on Sept. 25, Mr. Ryan repeatedly denied any interest in the speaker’s post. But party leaders pleaded with him to step up after the majority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, abandoned his own bid for the position in the face of sharp criticism from the same conservatives who had hounded Mr. Boehner. Mr. Ryan ultimately said he would accept the nomination but only if his colleagues rallied behind him, which they did last week. Although the Freedom Caucus did not formally endorse him, a majority of its members said they would vote for him.

    "source": "Marine Pilot Dies in Jet Crash in Britain <eos> LONDON — An American Marine was killed on Wednesday when the combat jet he was piloting crashed shortly after taking off from a Royal Air Force base in Lakenheath, England, about 80 miles northeast of London, the authorities said. The jet, an F/A-18 Hornet, crashed in farmland between 10:30 and 11 a.m. The Marine Corps said the crash had occurred near Littleport, while the police said it had occurred slightly to the east, around Redmere. The two villages are about six miles apart; Redmere is about eight miles west of the base in Lakenheath. “We can confirm one fatality and believe there was just one person on board the aircraft,” the Cambridgeshire Constabulary, the police agency responsible for the area, said in a statement . The corps confirmed the crash but did not have additional details. A Marine Corps spokesman at the United States European Command headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, said the pilot was part of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232, in the Third Marine Aircraft Wing, and was based at the Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar, a section of San Diego. While the Lakenheath base is owned by the Royal Air Force, it has been under the operational control of the United States military for decades. “The loss in Cambridgeshire today is terrible news, my thoughts & prayers are with all involved,” the United States ambassador to Britain, Matthew Barzun, wrote on Twitter.",

    "source": "An American Ambassador Who Plunged Into Arab Life <eos> J. Christopher Stevens , the American ambassador to Libya who was killed in an assault on a diplomatic mission there last week, was happy to gossip, but was revered for listening. A northern Californian with a toothy grin, he had a passion for the Arab world and its language, and he went out of his way to use it, whether with officials or shopkeepers, in an effort to show respect. In his willingness to allow others to be heard, even when he had an important message to impart, Mr. Stevens was an unusual American diplomat, friends and colleagues say. He allowed himself to be governed by the habits, proprieties and slower pace of the Arab world. With the State Department on high alert for security threats, especially since the Sept. 11 attacks, and many American diplomats consigned to embassies that resemble fortresses and armored motorcades that do not make unscheduled stops, Mr. Stevens plunged into Arab social life. He traded personal risk for personal contact. His comfort with his environment and his distaste for displays of security, some quietly suggest, may have led to a touch of overconfidence that cost him his life. His lonely death in Benghazi, a city he knew well, along with those of three other Americans, came during a Libyan militia attack on the American diplomatic mission there, where his presence had not been advertised. What the United States lost was not only one of its foremost Arabists, a man who built a bridge to the tribes and militias that toppled the Libyan dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi . It also may be losing, in the unrest sweeping a conflict-prone crescent of Muslim countries from Pakistan to Sudan, a style of diplomacy already on the decline: the street-smart, low-key negotiator who gets things done by building personal relationships. Mr. Stevens, 52, was known as Chris, but he often signed letters and e-mails to friends as Krees, the way many Arabs pronounced his name. His affection for Arab culture and street life, whether in Syria, Libya or the Palestinian territories, made him many friends and impressive networks of contacts. Precisely what happened the night he was killed is unclear. But for an American ambassador to have so little security on the anniversary of Sept. 11, especially in a part of Libya known for its radicalism, is bound to raise questions, and in some sense, only adds to the irony of his death in a country he loved, and that for the most part, loved him back as an ally and a friend. John Bell, an Arabic-speaking former Canadian diplomat, knew Mr. Stevens when they were young political officers together in Egypt, and later in Jerusalem. “He was a consummate professional, calm and deliberative, with a real sensitivity to the Arab world,” Mr. Bell said. “He was good on the ground, and he had a way about him that endeared him to a lot of people; he listened to a lot of people and was not highly opinionated. And that made him a good and unusual American diplomat.” Diana Buttu knew Mr. Stevens in Ramallah and Jerusalem for several years from the autumn of 2002, when he was the political officer dealing with the Palestinians and she was the legal adviser to the Palestinian negotiators. “He was a different kind of American diplomat, he really was,” she said. “First, he was interested in being here. He brought a lot of energy and he spoke Arabic, and reached out to people and tried to build relationships for the U.S. In my experience, many U.S. diplomats don’t speak Arabic, or if they do, they don’t try.” American diplomats, given a presentation on the Israeli settlements by the Palestinians, often responded with exasperation, Ms. Buttu said, complaining that the Palestinians “didn’t understand how much we do for you behind the scenes with the Israelis.” But Mr. Stevens was different, she said. “He would say, ‘Tell me more. Tell me more of what America can do to help and why.’ ” Harvey Morris, as a correspondent for The Financial Times, also knew Mr. Stevens then. For him, Mr. Stevens was both of a new generation and yet “very much in the tradition of old-school Americans who went to the region, that missionary generation that founded the American University of Beirut, long before any suggestion of U.S. neocolonialism.” Mr. Stevens was not above diplomatic gossip, said Mr. Morris, who now blogs for The International Herald Tribune. Recounting the private meeting of Cécilia Sarkozy, then the wife of the French president, with Colonel Qaddafi in 2007 to try to secure the release of some jailed Bulgarian nurses, Mr. Stevens noted that the Libyan leader had opened his robes and was naked underneath. (The former Mrs. Sarkozy says that is not true.) Another friend in Jerusalem, Noga Tarnopolsky, a journalist, remembers Mr. Stevens as “the ideal of what you want when you meet a diplomat; he was a complete anomaly,” she said. “Wherever he was living, he was able to let go of everything else and live that place completely.” But she said he was deeply frustrated with security regulations that confined his activities. “He wanted that human contact, he wanted to be able to speak to Palestinians on the street, and he couldn’t because security regulations made him always travel in armored vehicles,” she said. “He used to talk about how he felt this was an obstacle to his ability to really be who he wanted to be.” At the same time, she said, “those security measures might have saved his life in a very different context,” and now there creeps in a thought, she said, that perhaps he was too trusting. As a diplomat, Mr. Stevens also got very high marks from his superiors. “We were in Damascus together, and I remember running into him Friday in the souk, sipping tea, talking to merchants,” said his boss, Elizabeth Dibble, the principal deputy assistant secretary for the State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. “He went out and explored Syria. Many of us in a tough place stick together, but he had Syrian friends and international friends wherever he went.” Mr. Stevens, having served already in Colonel Qaddafi’s Libya, was the perfect choice as the first ambassador to a new Libya, she said, especially after having spent six months in Benghazi during the war working to help the rebel National Transitional Council. He had gone to Benghazi by boat, with one other diplomat, two security officers and a couple of armored cars. “For him it wasn’t just the sense of adventure,” Ms. Dibble said. “It was not something every Foreign Service officer would be willing to do.” He also had the diplomat’s requisite patience. “It takes a lot of tea,” Ms. Dibble said. “You don’t rush into talking points, you develop a relationship and a personal connection, and a series of connections becomes a network. Many Americans, we start at A and work down the list to F. But A to B is not a straight line, and Chris had an instinctive feel for this, how to get things done.” The French writer and activist Bernard-Henri Lévy, who made early contact with the rebels in Benghazi and helped persuade the French to intervene, knew Mr. Stevens then, and related a meeting Mr. Stevens had in April 2011 with Mustafa Abdul Jalil, the chairman of the council. “I was struck by the mix of human warmth and professional diplomacy,” Mr. Lévy said, and “by his great capacity to listen and his strategy to speak last.” David Welch, a retired senior State Department official, knew Mr. Stevens from a first posting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 1992 and helped promote him. “He was one of the best of his generation,” Mr. Welch said. Helena Kane Finn, who was a senior diplomat at the American Embassy in Israel, remembers her encounters with Mr. Stevens with fondness and respect. “He was able to keep his balance and remain open-minded,” she said. “And he had sheer courage. It takes a lot of guts to go into Libya and do what he did. It’s not just dinners and cocktail parties. It’s people like him who really count.” Martin Indyk was Mr. Stevens’s boss in Washington in the late 1990s, when Mr. Stevens was running the Iran desk in an earlier effort to re-engage with Tehran. “He wanted to learn Farsi on the side,” Mr. Indyk remembered. “He wanted to be our first diplomat on the ground there, which was a stretch to me, but it was no surprise that he was first on the ground in Libya. Some people enjoy bureaucratic fighting in Washington, but he wanted to be out on the front lines where the fires burn. There aren’t a lot of people like that.” Roya Hakakian, an Iranian-born writer who met him then, said that “he displayed the quintessential sunny innocence of Americans.” Late last year, as Mr. Stevens waited for his confirmation hearings, they met in Washington, she wrote in thedailybeast.com . They spoke about the radicalization of the Libyan opposition and her concern that there would inevitably be a lashing out at the United States. She cited the takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979 as inevitable, given the revolutionary narrative. “Chris’s face was unusually flushed as he listened,” Ms. Hakakian wrote. “He was far more hopeful about the future.” He seemed hurt, she said. “Chris had fallen in love with Libya’s revolution. At the end, those very forces whose influence he thought would be curbed had claimed his life.”",

    "source": "Construction of Disputed Turkish Dam Continues <eos> ILISU, TURKEY — Mahmut Dundar raised a remote control toward a flat-screen monitor suspended from the ceiling of his office beside the Tigris River in southeast Turkey. “These are live,” he said, as he toggled between images of men and machines swarming over a dozen different building sites of the Ilisu Dam project. The feed goes to the prime minister’s office in Ankara, Mr. Dundar, general manager of the project, said last week. “The prime minister can watch every point of construction 24 hours a day, minute by minute, so he is informed of our progress at all times. He has set the target for completion for 2014, and we mean to make that date.” About 1,450 workers are laboring around the clock to complete the Ilisu Dam, one of the most controversial public works projects in recent history, by the middle of next year. That would be exactly five years after European lenders pulled out of the €1.1 billion, or $1.5 billion, project in July 2009, citing concerns about environmental impact, resettlement policies and the destruction of cultural treasures. Undeterred, Ankara quickly raised domestic financing and resumed work in 2010. “We have now completed 53 percent of the project, and we will complete the rest on time,” said Mr. Dundar, who is also regional director of the state hydraulic works. “We have no funding problems whatsoever, we work day and night, and all relevant agencies are in constant coordination.” On the construction site, about 40 kilometers, or 25 miles, from the Syrian border and 70 kilometers from Iraq, the roar of machinery drowned out the rushing waters of the Tigris, which has been diverted from its natural bed to flow through three diversion tunnels and emerge roiling and foaming into a new concrete basin. The surrounding mountain ridges bristled with military sentry posts and surveillance equipment guarding the construction site against the Kurdish rebels roaming the area. Trucks and earth movers hauled loads of limestone, basalt and clay onto the rising body of the dam, which is to attain a height of 141 meters, or 460 feet, when complete. The crest of the dam will be 2.3 kilometers long, with a volume of 24 million cubic meters of earth and rock. One-third of that is done, Mr. Dundar said, with the rest scheduled to be finished within the year. “Meanwhile, construction of the spillway and the power plant are going ahead according to plan,” he added. If the project stays on track, the Ilisu Dam will begin to impound water next year. Filling the reservoir could take anywhere from 5 to 11 months, Mr. Dundar said, depending on the season in which it is begun. “We think the reservoir will be filled in 2015,” he added. The project appeared to hit a snag last month when Turkey’s highest administrative court ruled that a decree issued by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan last year to accelerate work on the dam was in part null and void. The court declared invalid that part of the decree that declared all infrastructure projects connected to the dam to be exempt from environmental impact assessment requirements on the grounds that plans for the dam were drawn up before the relevant law came into effect in 1993. Opponents of the project were jubilant and staged a rally in Ankara, calling for the Ilisu construction site to be shut down. Emre Baturay Altinok, the lawyer who lodged the complaint on behalf of environmentalists, said by telephone from Ankara this month: “It is unlawful to continue work on the project without environmental impact assessments. The construction site must be closed and sealed.” Mr. Dundar disagreed with that interpretation of the ruling, which he said would not impede work on the dam. “The ruling does not even remotely have anything to do with stopping the project,” he said. “It is merely about applying the environmental impact assessment regulations, which we are now doing anyway.” The state hydraulic works authority has lodged an objection to the ruling, asking for clarification of certain terms, he said. “But in any case,” he added, “the final judgment will definitely not stop the project.” Mr. Altinok, the lawyer, said he was not surprised that construction was continuing six weeks after the court ruling. “That is the way of justice in Turkey,” he said. “We are accustomed to court rulings against large projects not being implemented.” The Ilisu project has long inflamed passions in Turkey and beyond. Concerns about its environmental, cultural and social impact forced companies and financial backers from Germany, Austria and Switzerland to pull out of the project under pressure from public campaigns in 2009. With a capacity of 11 billion cubic meters of water, the Ilisu reservoir will flood more than 30,000 hectares of land, or 74,000 acres, submerging parts of the historical town of Hasankeyf upstream, as well as uncharted archaeological sites along the Tigris. The waters will displace 199 settlements, affecting 55,000 people, according to a report drawn up in 2008 by international experts acting on behalf of European export-credit agencies. Scientists are at work in Hasankeyf to prepare for the removal of cultural monuments to a safe location across the Tigris and to fortify higher parts of the ancient town that will not be submerged, Mr. Dundar said. A new town on a mountainside across the river from Hasankeyf is nearing completion and should be ready for resettlement of the town’s population before the water begins to rise. Resettlement has been completed in the village of Ilisu near the dam site, where villagers were moved to a new settlement at the end of 2010. Villagers interviewed in Ilisu this month were unenthusiastic about their new homes, despite the running water in modern kitchens and bathrooms and communal amenities such as a playground and a meeting room. “It was better in our old village,” a woman who gave her name as Zekine said. “Our fields and orchards were there. They are all gone now.” Many villagers complained about the loss of their farmland. “Most people here work on the dam construction site now, but once that wraps up, there will be no place to work,” said Mehmet, a young man who did not give his family name. “I preferred our old village, because we had our orchards and our vines and could always make a living if we worked hard.” “We were farmers, now we are workers,” said Osman Demir, from the neighboring village of Karabayir, whose agricultural land was nationalized to build the new village of Ilisu. Like most settlements affected by the dam, his village has not applied for resettlement by the state. Besides Ilisu and Hasankeyf, only one other village has signed up for resettlement, Mr. Dundar confirmed. “It is up to the free will and democratic wishes of the villagers,” he said. “We want to build modern settlements for them. But we can only do it for those who want it.” This is what opponents of the dam have feared all along, said Arif Arslan, president of the Friends of Hasankeyf Association in Batman, who has been monitoring the Ilisu project for 20 years. “It will be just like when the Batman dam was built and 20,000 villagers were displaced” in the 1990s, Mr. Arslan said in a recent interview. “Villagers will move to the city with their cash compensations, the money will run out, and they will end up leading miserable lives in the slums.” Mr. Arslan is skeptical that the Ilisu project will contribute to the welfare and development of the region, among the poorest in Turkey. “We have seen 18 dams built in this region already,” he said. “Do you see a rise in the standard of living anywhere around here?” In Ilisu, Mr. Dundar said that “every project has unwanted side effects.” Yet the Ilisu Dam is essential to the development of the country and the welfare of its people, he argued. “Our country needs energy, and we are trying to meet that need,” he said. Ilisu’s 1,200-megawatt hydroelectric power plant is designed to produce nearly 4 billion kilowatt hours of energy per year, worth an annual $400 million, according to project managers. “Our country’s weakest spot is its dependency on energy imports,” Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said at the opening of Ilisu’s diversion tunnels last year. To partly overcome that dependency, he added, “This jumbo project is of the utmost strategic and economic importance to our country.”",

    "source": "A Review of ‘Art at the Core’ at the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art in Peekskill <eos> “Art at the Core: The Intersection of Visual Art, Performance and Technology” at the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art in Peekskill feels more like an arbitrary collection of artworks than a specially curated show. Nonetheless, there is some attempt at binding the exhibition together with a common theme. According to a gallery release, the few dozen works by 23 artists “lend themselves to narrative interpretation” and look toward art to address “the very core of our everyday lives, our ‘Weltanschauung,’ ” or worldview. This is a vague and general order. Doesn’t art always reflect the worldview of the artist and try to cut through the distractions cluttering our daily lives to address our “core” existence? Still, a few works here seem to fit the bill. One is by Chen Zhen, an artist who was born in Shanghai in 1955 and was diagnosed with a rare condition, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, at age 25. (He died in 2005.) The work here, “Traitment Musical/Vibratoire” (1997) is a big armature made with bed frames over which the artist stretched yak skins to create makeshift drums audiences could play. Diagrams drawn on the skins identify parts of the body, but also link traditional Chinese medicine with other cultures’ traditions and religion with everyday life. Image Jon Pylypchuk’s “I Thought They Were My Children” (2000). Credit Howard Goodman Another work that has an interesting story and uses enigmatic materials is Jeffrey Schrier’s “Unfinished Flight,” from the series “Wings of Witness.” Mr. Schrier, who lives in nearby Croton-on-Hudson, took more than 11 million drink-can tabs collected from around the world by junior high students in Illinois; the number of tabs is meant to commemorate the number of lives lost in the Holocaust. Mr. Schrier uses the tabs to create sculptures that look somewhat feathery. The one here refers to the poem “The Butterfly,” written by Pavel Friedmann while he was imprisoned in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, near Prague. It also recalls the work of El Anatsui, the African artist who uses metal retrieved from recycling stations to create tapestry-like sculptures. Several painters and photographers here make work that is highly narrative. David Drebin’s photograph “Girl in Orange Dress” (2009) captures a woman gazing out a picture window at a metropolis below and is reminiscent of Gregory Crewdson’s film-noir inspired photographs (but also Andrew Wyeth’s famous 1948 painting “ Christina’s World ”). The master of this genre, Jeff Wall, is represented here by “Rear, 304 E 25th Ave., May 20, 1997, 1:14 & 1:17 p.m.” (1997). A montage of two silver gelatin prints — one giant and one much smaller — the work depicts a drug transaction taking place outside a dilapidated house, presumably in Vancouver where Mr. Wall was born and still lives. There is more of a breakdown with the painting on view here: much of the better work seems to have nothing to do with the exhibition’s purported themes, while lesser works illustrate the idea of narrative and the everyday worldview quite nicely. In the former category are works by veteran abstractionists like Suzan Frecon, represented here by a dark red canvas titled “Soforouge” (2009), and Dan Christensen’s “Sagaponto” (1973), a moody, vaguely minimalist painting in which you can see different colors peeking out from under the acrylic white paint. A great work here is Charles Hinman’s “Castor and Pollux” (1968), which could just as easily be described as a sculpture; part of the shaped canvas tradition of the late ’60s and ’70s, Mr. Hinman’s work is more like a geometric wall relief than a two-dimensional painting. Image Jeffrey Schrier’s “Unfinished Flight” (2013). Credit Howard Goodman Paintings by Stephan Balleux, Jonas Burgert, Bryan El Castillo and Robert Fekete rely on a kind of post-post-Surrealist sense of drama and the uncanny — the same thing that much of the ’80s and ’90s photography like Mr. Crewdson’s and Mr. Wall’s was based on. Here it feels like a well-worn trope. Yigal Ozeri’s portrait of “Priscilla in Vines” (2009) at least comes with an interesting back story: While searching on Craigslist for models for his paintings, Mr. Ozeri met a man who suggested his girlfriend as a suitable muse. And that is how he met the subject of the painting, who stares out from behind a mass of hanging branches; a woman who lived in the forest in Maine and got all her food from nature. (You can’t tell any of this from the painting.) Some other notable works here that don’t seem to fit into any cogent exhibition narrative are by Phyllida Barlow, Matt Keegan, Haroon Mirza, Adam Pendleton, Jon Pylypchuk, Florian Schmidt and Ben Schumacher. If “Art at the Core” feels more like a gallery experience than a museum one, part of that has to do with the nature of the organization that is hosting the show. Founded by the art collectors Marc and Livia Straus, the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art is not too different from places — prevalent, for instance, in Miami — where private collections are open for public view. (Or, on a much larger scale, the Rubin Museum of Art or the Neue Galerie in Manhattan.) The center has always seemed to split the difference between being a small public museum and one devoted to collectors’ interests. The latter feels more pronounced here, however — and now more than ever since Mr. Straus has opened a gallery in Lower Manhattan (he had an exhibition of Mr. Hinman’s works in 2012). At the same time, the day I visited the center there was a table filled with art supplies, occupied by locals making scruffy sculptures. While “Art at the Core” didn’t impress me much as an exhibition, the sight of this creativity happening just yards away from a few accomplished artworks did.",

    "source": "Greenwich Village Fire Shows Hazards of Wood Decks <eos> Flames licked over the parapet of a Greenwich Village building on Monday morning and black smoke billowed into the air after a wooden roof deck ignited. It was the second time in less than a week that a wood roof deck in Lower Manhattan had caught fire, underscoring the fact that such decking can be transformed into dangerous tinder if not properly cared for, said Salvatore J. Cassano, the fire commissioner. “Wood that is exposed to the air, exposed to the sun and the cold, it dries out and becomes fire prone,” Mr. Cassano said. “It may be nice to have a roof deck, but make sure it’s done according to the law, according to the codes.” The fire shortly before noon on Monday, on the top of the six-story, cast-iron Mercantile Exchange building on Broadway, resulted in just a few minor injuries, but people were evacuated from at least two buildings and traffic on Broadway was halted for about 90 minutes as firefighters put out the flames. On Thursday, there was a fire involving a wood deck on the roof of 240 East Houston Street, a five-story brick condominium building at the corner of Avenue A. The fire displaced residents and filled nearby streets with a gray haze. And in June, a wood roof deck on top of a residential building on West 72nd Street caught fire; it was extinguished without serious injuries, although parts of the building sustained water damage. Deputy Chief Bob Carroll of the Fire Department’s Division 1, said that on Monday more than a dozen trucks and about 70 firefighters responded to the two-alarm fire on Broadway, between Bleecker and Houston Streets, and found flames rising from the wood decking. Chief Carroll said the firefighters extinguished the flames then cut through the roof to put out the fire that had penetrated the rooftop and charred support beams. Four firefighters and another person had minor injuries, he said. Sarah Spratt, a hair stylist, said that when the fire in the Mercantile building started on Monday morning, she was involved in a photography shoot in a studio on the sixth floor. The blaze filled the halls with smoke and sent workers rushing downstairs, she said. Darrin Navarro, who was also working in the studio, said a smell like burning rubber prompted him to go up to the roof, where he found the deck ablaze. “The flames were over six feet tall,” he said. On Monday afternoon, Mr. Cassano said the two recent deck fires were being investigated.",

    "source": "Born Irish, but With Illegal Parents <eos> DUBLIN — Cork-born and proud of it, George-Jordan Dimbo is top to toe the Irish lad. He studies Gaelic, eats rashers, plays hurling, prays to the saints, papers his walls with parochial school awards, and spends Saturdays at the telly watching Dustin the Turkey, a wisecracking puppet, mock the powerful. If the Irish government has its way, he may soon be living in Africa. George, 11, is an Irish citizen and has been since his birth when Ireland , alone in Europe, still gave citizenship to anyone born on its soil. His mother and father, Ifedinma and Ethelbert Dimbo, are illegal immigrants from Nigeria, who brought him back to Ireland three years ago, judging it the best place to raise him. Since then, the unusual trio — the Irish schoolboy and his African parents — have shared a single room in a worn Dublin hostel while facing a prospect dreaded by children on both sides of the Atlantic, a parent’s deportation. “Dear justice minister,” George wrote when he was 9. “I heard my Mommy and Daddy whispering about deportation. Please do not deport us.” “Remember,” he added, “I am also an Irish child.” Thousands of Irish children face similar risks, living in a country where one or both parents do not legally reside. Their stories find abundant parallels in the United States, where an estimated five million children — including three million American citizens — have parents who are illegal immigrants. New efforts to catch them make fear of deportation a growing factor in American life, the flip side of generous laws that make infants instant citizens. The battle over the “I.B.C.’s” — Irish-born children — stems from a decade of head-turning change that has brought this island of red-haired Marys and blue-eyed Seans the demographic version of an extreme makeover. For centuries, Ireland was a racially homogenous land of emigrants. Now it is a multicultural nation of immigrants, whose share of the population, 11 percent, is nearly as high as that in the United States. Years of Irish prosperity have drawn Polish plumbers, Lithuanian nannies, Latvian farm workers, Filipino nurses, Chinese traders, and sub-Saharan asylum seekers. The town of Portlaoise, about 40 miles southwest of Dublin, has the country’s first African-born mayor. The Synge Street School, where George Dimbo says his Hail Marys beneath a plaster Virgin, is walking distance from the city’s first mosque and rents classroom space to two Chinese academies. “I went to bed in one country and woke up in a different one,” writes the Irish novelist, Roddy Doyle, in a collection of short stories called “The Deportees” (Viking, 2007). They depict characters as diverse as an African war survivor on his first day of class, and Fat Gandhi, a gay tandoori vendor who “quickly realized that his loud embrace of Christianity was very good for business.” The Dimbos are the kind of memorable figures who might have tumbled from Mr. Doyle’s pages. A former graduate student in Cork, Ms. Dimbo, 42, wore a Yoruba headdress to a recent parent-student event, and has just written a feminist novel about a migrant prostitute. Mr. Dimbo, 43, releases his frustrations with a daily run through the Dublin streets, and George is so unusually courteous that his sixth-grade teacher thought he was “taking the mickey”—Irish for pulling his leg. “He’s the most mannerly child I’ve taught in years,” said the teacher, Brendan O’Boyle. “He’s very, very good, very upright, very honest.” “He’s one of the best guys we’ve ever had,” said last year’s teacher, Gerard Mooney. Not long after George arrived, a classmate told him that he disliked black people. “But I’m black,” George recalls answering. “No,” the boy said. “You’re Irish.” So Far, Little Conflict Ireland’s dash to diversity has so far provoked little of the conflict found elsewhere in Europe or the United States. There are no major anti-immigrant political parties and little anti-immigrant violence. When a Dublin high school student, Olukunle Elukanlo, was deported to Nigeria in 2005, his protesting classmates won his return. Government officials here often credit Irish history for the tolerance. “There’s an emotional sense of understanding about what immigrants are going through because of our experience as immigrants,” said Conor Lenihan, the minister of integration. But others see undercurrents of racial unease that could boil into conflict, especially if hard times return. “In Irish literature there’s a big fear of the returned immigrant who brings all sorts of chaos with him,” said Mary Gilmartin, a geographer at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. “Many people here feel threatened.” As recently as the 1980s, young Irish were fleeing unemployment in droves, many to work illegally in the United States. By the late 1990s, an economic boom called the Celtic Tiger was luring them home, along with droves of foreign construction workers, farm hands, waitresses and nannies. A wave of asylum seekers joined them, many from Africa. Some had escaped harrowing wars or genital mutilation. But officials grew skeptical of their claims as their numbers surged to about 12,000 in 2002 from a trickle a decade before. Ireland not only offered citizenship to children born upon arrival; until 2003 it also allowed their illegal-immigrant parents to stay, a shortcut many asylum seekers used to win residency. Word got out: with a visa to Britain, a pregnant woman could reach Northern Ireland, take a cab across the border, and gain residency by giving birth. Ms. Gilmartin argues that reports of abuse were exaggerated. But a 2004 referendum changed the rules, reserving citizenship for the children of longtime legal residents. It passed with nearly 80 percent of the vote. By then, Ireland had about 18,000 mixed families of Irish children and illegal-immigrant parents. Wary of the costs of large-scale deportation, the government ran a one-time legalization program that gave residency to about 95 percent of those parents. The Dimbos were among the 1,000 or so families whose cases were rejected, and they have appealed to the Supreme Court. Their situation, like that of millions in the United States, pits competing interests: those of children (to live in their country with their parents) against those of states (to enforce borders for the perceived common good). Odyssey to Ireland Ms. Dimbo first came to Ireland legally, to get a master’s degree in sociology in 1995. She was recently married, two months pregnant, and unaware, she said, that Irish law would make George a citizen. She gained legal residency through his citizenship, but they returned to Nigeria when George was 2 to join his father, who ran an import business. With Ms. Dimbo working as a bank manager in Lagos, the family lived comfortably, but came back to Ireland twice, believing each time that George’s citizenship and their past residence gave them the right to stay. The most recent time was in 2005, to apply for the legalization program, not realizing, they said, that it only covered families who had remained in Ireland, which disqualified them. With their savings gone, they have spent nearly three years in a government “accommodation center” — a dormitory where they share one room, line up for meals, and are barred from working. “You feel like you’re a prisoner,” said Mr. Dimbo, a proud man dismayed by his forced dependency. “If we had known our lives would be like this, we never would have come.” George said if his parents left, he would go with them — “every child needs his parents” — and wrote the justice minister to convey his fears. “I am very worried,” he wrote. Gathered at another accommodation center, an hour outside Dublin in Mosney, many parents said their fears of deportation had begun to affect their children. “My daughter knows I’m depressed,” said a single mother from Nigeria, who declined to be identified for fear of harming her case. “She goes, ‘Did I do anything wrong?’ ” Another single mother said, “I’m afraid I’m going to hurt my child.” Other complaints come from men sneaking into Ireland, to join their children and wives who got residency through the legalization program. To avoid new waves of migration, the program gave no right to family reunification. “Unless we control the flows of people, public attitudes will turn against the whole process of immigration ,” said Mr. Lenihan, the government minister. But in denying children their fathers, the men say, the government may create the kind of immigrant underclass that plagues other parts of Europe. “Our children are going to be growing up angry,” said one of four illegal-immigrant fathers from Nigeria who met with a reporter in Balbriggan, a Dublin suburb. Another father blamed race. “If our kids were really Irish to them, they would not say, ‘Take the fathers away,’ ” he said. At the same time, many of those facing deportation marvel at Ireland’s virtues, including the freedom to protest without getting shot and ambulances that come when summoned. When Lynda Onuoha joined Mosney mothers to demonstrate outside Parliament, they waved Irish flags. “We wanted people passing by to see that even though our kids are black, they are Irish by nationality, and we want to make a home here,” she said. Even after tightening its rules, Ireland remains more generous than most of its European peers. The United States is the rare country that gives immediate citizenship to the children born inside its borders, whether their immigrant parents are legal residents or not. A 2007 bill to end the practice, which stems from the 14th Amendment, drew nearly 100 Congressional co-sponsors, though legal scholars have traditionally argued that a change would require a constitutional amendment. Fear for U.S. Children Deportations in the United States have been rare, but with enforcement on the rise, migrant groups warn of a new generation of American children haunted by fear. Border control advocates respond that the parents have only themselves to blame, for migrating illegally. At times, Ms. Dimbo says the same. “To come here without papers, we are wrong,” she said. “We are cap in hand, saying for George’s sake, let us forgive and forget.” Adding her own note of Irish chauvinism, she said it was only when she got to Donegal that she appreciated the phrase “deep, blue sea.” Mr. Dimbo added, “I love this country.” George has spent 6 of his 11 years in Ireland, including most of his school years. What he recalls of Nigeria is mostly the heat and the corporal punishment in school. Asked if he feels more Irish or Nigerian, he answered politely in a Dublin lilt. “I think I feel more Irish,” he said. “For one, because I am Irish.”",

Mr. Stahl, hired in 2002, will stay on as an adviser for 30 days, Revlon, which is based in New York, said yesterday. Mr. Kennedy, 59, also joined Revlon in 2002, as president of Revlon International. He became chief financial officer in March. Revlon, which makes cosmetics sold under its own name and the Almay brand, has posted losses for eight consecutive years, and Mr. Kennedy will be the third chief executive since 1999. Revlon is saddled with almost $1.7 billion in debt and faces competition from larger rivals, such as L’Oréal and Procter & Gamble’s Cover Girl brand. Shares of Revlon fell 2 cents yesterday, or 1.4 percent, to $1.41. Revlon said on Aug. 3 that its second-quarter loss more than doubled as sales of two lines, Vital Radiance and Almay, did not meet expectations.",

    "source": "A Muted Beginning to Sales of Apple’s iPhone Through China Mobile <eos> Apple is counting on a long-awaited agreement with China Mobile, the world’s largest cellular operator, to make major headway in China. But before Apple declares any major degree of success, the technology giant may need to overcome some significant hurdles. A hint of the challenges was apparent on Friday, when customers were finally able to buy iPhones from China Mobile. At a store in Beijing, only about a dozen customers showed up to buy iPhones, despite the appearance of Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive. It was a far cry from the long lines that usually accompany a big introduction in the United States Apple and Mr. Cook have made improved sales in China a high priority — and that has meant getting on China Mobile, which has more than 750 million customers. Mr. Cook’s presence in China this week signaled the importance that Apple has attached to the market. Sales will not necessarily come easy. As the country’s economy boomed, some other Western brands in China gained a loyal following. From Gillette razors to Walmart stores, American products and companies were generally seen as superior to domestic alternatives, even though many of the products, like iPhones, were assembled in China. But recently, foreign brands have been subjected to intense scrutiny by the Chinese news media, especially the state-run CCTV, prompting consumers to reconsider domestic alternatives. In one recent example, Walmart recalled donkey meat that it was selling at several outlets in China after it was found to have been tainted with fox meat. When iPhones were introduced in China five years ago by the country’s second-largest mobile operator, China Unicom, they found a ready market among trend-conscious consumers. Since then, despite adding the country’s third-biggest carrier, China Telecom, to its lineup, Apple has lost ground to the market leader in smartphones, Samsung Electronics, and lower-end domestic rivals. Apple’s market share in China has fallen into the single digits. “Apple used to be the must-have, aspirational brand for all wealthy and middle-class Chinese consumers,” said Shaun Rein, managing director of the China Market Research Group and the author of “The End of Cheap China.” “But over the last year, there has been a real deterioration of the Apple brand.” Some American tech giants continue to thrive in China. Microsoft remains the overwhelmingly dominant provider of PC operating systems. Others, like Facebook and Twitter, have been blocked from entering China, and still others have faded. Google was once a leading search engine in China, but then lost ground to a local rival, Baidu, and scaled back its presence in the country rather than submit to censorship demands. Motorola was once a power in mobile phones in China, but it was supplanted by companies like Nokia of Finland — which, in turn, yielded leadership to Apple and Samsung. More recently, Cisco Systems, the maker of telecommunications network equipment, said sales in China had been hurt by disclosures of surveillance by the National Security Agency. Apple still has fans, including Xia Bingyi, a 26-year-old customer from the eastern Chinese city of Jinan. She was one of 10 people who won a trip to Beijing to buy an iPhone on the opening day of China Mobile’s offering. Ms. Xia already owned an iPhone 4 she bought two years ago, but said she did not hesitate to sign up for a new iPhone 5S once China Mobile began offering it. “This is like manna from heaven!” she said. Among consumers who have to pay their own way, however, price has been a big barrier to bringing the iPhone to a broader audience in China. The list price of 5,288 renminbi (about $870) an iPhone in China is more than many people’s monthly salary, especially outside the major cities. China Mobile has been less aggressive on pricing and subsidies than some analysts had expected. To get the iPhone 5S free of charge, subscribers must commit to a two-year contract at 588 renminbi a month. China Unicom and China Telecom, which together have about 450 million customers, have cut the price of their competing iPhone packages only modestly since China Mobile announced its Apple agreement in December. “There won’t be a subsidy war among the three operators because they have already learned that they need to control this,” said Jun Zhang, an analyst at Wedge Partners, an equity research firm. On Sina Weibo, a microblogging service, some users complained about the pricing of the iPhone 5S by China Mobile, saying they could get smuggled versions from Hong Kong for less money. “The model is the same,” one contributor wrote on Weibo. “I want the cheaper one.” Before the deal with Apple, China Mobile said 45 million people were using iPhones on its network, most of them acquired from Hong Kong or via other unofficial channels. This accounts for more than 60 percent of the iPhones in use in China, according to Craig Yu, research director at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, a research firm. China Mobile, which has 3,000 stores, has one big advantage over its two rivals — the fast network it is building, using so-called 4G technology. China Unicom and China Telecom are still relying on the slower, previous generation technology. But this could bring muddled results for Apple, because analysts say some China Mobile iPhone sales will come from customers already using iPhones and just switching carriers. As a result, estimates of iPhone sales by China Mobile, which have ranged from fewer than 10 million annually to more than 30 million, might not budge its market share as much as the unit sales might suggest. An Apple spokeswoman, Carolyn Wu, declined to comment on the first-day sales figures. Previously, China Mobile had reported more than one million preorders for the phone via its website since the deal was announced in December. Mr. Zhang at Wedge Partners said such online registrations generally resulted in firm orders in only about a third of the cases, meaning Apple could expect to sell about 400,000 iPhones. Over all, including the effect of customers switching from rival networks, Mr. Zhang said he expected Apple to sell about one million more phones a month in China as a result of the deal, on top of the roughly three million it has been selling. In a market of more than one billion mobile phone customers, those are somewhat modest figures. That may help explain why even Mr. Cook seemed to be looking as much to the future as to the present as he traveled to Beijing for the China Mobile introduction. “Today is just the beginning of China Mobile and Apple coming together to deliver the best experience in the world,” Mr. Cook said at an appearance on Friday. Analysts say Apple could probably broaden its potential market in China by making phones with features that appeal more to Chinese consumers, like bigger screens. Handsets like the Samsung Note 3, which has a 5.7-inch screen, compared with the 4-inch screen of the Apple 5S and 5C, have been selling well in China. “We never talk about future things,” Mr. Cook said. “We have great things we are working on but we want to keep them secret. That way you will be so much happier when you see it.”",

    "source": "Sharks’ Streak Raises Concern About Peaking <eos> The San Jose Sharks have come streaking into the playoffs, winning 18 of 21 games since Feb. 20. Only in the N.H.L. could this be perceived as a problem. “Any hesitancy that you’re going to peak too soon?” Coach Ron Wilson was asked during a conference call last week. “Don’t you want to lose a couple of games before you get to the playoffs?” There is a persistent belief among commentators and fans that winning too much in the regular season is bad, as if it somehow detracts from a team’s playoff abilities. “We try and prepare to win every game,” Wilson said unapologetically. “You don’t plan on a streak like this. We want to keep playing our kind of hockey right now, playoff hockey.” Mike Babcock, coach of the only team to finish ahead of the Sharks, the Presidents’ Trophy-winning Detroit Red Wings, heard a similar question during another conference call last week. “Are you worried about just cruising into the playoffs?” he was asked. “I’ve been on both ends of it in the Stanley Cup playoffs,” Babcock said. “When you’re the higher seed, the other teams have usually been battling like crazy and sometimes you’ve been drifting along. The great thing for us this year is our games down the stretch here have been against teams that are good teams that have played us real difficult.” It seems strange to have to explain why it is good to finish far in front of everyone else as the Wings and the Sharks have this season. One reason, certainly, is the comfortable margin of error it offers a team. That has given San Jose the luxury of resting banged-up players like Jonathan Cheechoo and cutting back on the lengthy ice time of key players like defenseman Brian Campbell and center Joe Thornton. The puck-moving Campbell, acquired from Buffalo at the trade deadline, has been to the Sharks what Ringo Starr was to his new bandmates, the Beatles. The Wings, after a series of injuries that began in February and nearly derailed their season — the latest was the loss of forward Tomas Kopecky to torn knee ligaments Thursday — have fought through their tribulations and are playing well on the eve of the playoffs. “We are on a great roll, and we’ve got to continue it,” Babcock said. “We’re playing the kind of hockey you need to to be successful in the playoffs.” No Guarantee for No. 1 The perception that winning in the regular season is bad preparation for the playoffs may arise from the disappointingly early playoff exits of a number of top teams — notably the Red Wings — in recent years. Although the team that finished first over all has won 36 of 80 Stanley Cups since the N.H.L. took sole possession of the trophy in 1926 — about once every 2.2 seasons — the No. 1 team has not done nearly so well recently. Only 4 of the last 17 Cups have been won by the regular-season champion. Alan Reifman, a professor of human development at Texas Tech University who has a specialty in statistical correlation and causality, found that over the past five postseasons there was only a modest correlation between the performance of N.H.L. teams in the regular season and their performance in the playoffs. In his calculation comparing teams’ point totals in the regular season with how far they advanced in the playoffs, a correlation coefficient of zero would represent no relationship between the two competitions. A one would represent an exact relationship wherein the Presidents’ Trophy winner also wins the Stanley Cup, the second-place teams gets to the Cup finals, and so on. Last season, that figure was .50, a “moderately strong correlation,” Reifman said. In 2005-6, it was .33, a moderate-to-weak correlation. The season before that, it was .31, preceded by a very weak .04 and a moderately strong .50. In the N.B.A., Reifman said, the correlation in recent years between regular-season and playoff performance has been much stronger, averaging more than .50. In other words, an N.B.A. team that finishes high in the standings can expect to do very well in the playoffs. Not so for an N.H.L. team. But any Red Wings fan could have told you that. Returning With Vengeance The Boston College Eagles are back in the Frozen Four, and they would prefer not to watch for a third consecutive time as another team celebrates a national championship at the other end of the rink. The Eagles join Michigan, North Dakota and Notre Dame in the tournament, which will be played Thursday and Saturday at the Pepsi Center in Denver. “We want to win it this time,” Boston College Coach Jerry York told College Hockey News after the Eagles beat No. 2 Miami of Ohio in overtime to win the Northeast Regional. “We’ve given ourselves a chance to win it, and hopefully we get some puck luck this time.” To reach the final for a third straight year, the Eagles will have to get past North Dakota. The Fighting Sioux are making their fourth consecutive Frozen Four appearance. They have a powerful offense, led by T. J. Oshie and Ryan Duncan, last season’s Hobey Baker Award winner, and a stingy goaltender in Jean-Philippe Lamoureux. He faced almost 90 shots in defeating Princeton and Wisconsin in Midwest Regional games. The other semifinal features Michigan, ranked No. 1, against Notre Dame, which barely gained a postseason invitation and is making its first Frozen Four appearance. The Wolverines, making their first appearance since 2003, rely on the high-scoring senior forwards Kevin Porter and Chad Kolarik. Porter, after scoring four goals in a regional victory over Niagara, is considered the favorite to win this year’s Hobey. The other finalists for the award are the junior forward Nathan Gerbe, the 5-foot-5 scoring dynamo for Boston College, and the senior forward Ryan Jones of Miami. Yashin Rolls On The former Senator and Islander Alexei Yashin, reviled by most N.H.L. fans as the prototypical overpaid, petulant European player who disappears in the postseason, continues to excel in his return to the Russian Superliga. He is the top playoff scorer with 14 points in 13 games and has led Lokomotiv Yaroslavl to the final against the runaway regular-season champion, Salavat Yulaev Ufa. The best-of-five series is tied, 1-1, and resumes Monday in Yaroslavl.",

    "source": "Justice Thomas D. Raffaele Says Police Officer Struck Him <eos> Thomas D. Raffaele, a 69-year-old justice of the New York State Supreme Court, encountered a chaotic scene while walking down a Queens street with a friend: Two uniformed police officers stood over a shirtless man lying facedown on the pavement. The man’s hands were cuffed behind his back and he was screaming. A crowd jeered at the officers. The judge, concerned the crowd was becoming unruly, called 911 and reported that the officers needed help. But within minutes, he said, one of the two officers became enraged — and the judge became his target. The officer screamed and cursed at the onlookers, some of whom were complaining about what they said was his violent treatment of the suspect, and then he focused on Justice Raffaele, who was wearing a T-shirt and jeans. The judge said the officer rushed forward and, using the upper edge of his hand, delivered a sharp blow to the judge’s throat that was like what he learned when he was trained in hand-to-hand combat in the Army. The episode, Friday morning just after midnight — in which the judge says his initial complaint about the officer was dismissed by a sergeant, the ranking supervisor at the scene — is now the focus of investigations by the police Internal Affairs Bureau and the Civilian Complaint Review Board . The judge said he believed the officer also hit one or two other people during the encounter on 74th Street near 37th Road, a busy commercial strip in Jackson Heights. But he said he could not be sure, because the blow to his throat sent him reeling back and he then doubled over in pain. “I’ve always had profound respect for what they do,” Justice Raffaele said of the police, noting that he was “always very supportive” of the department during the more than 20 years he served on Community Board 3 in Jackson Heights before becoming a judge. At one point in the early 1990s, he added, he helped organize a civilian patrol in conjunction with the police. “And this I thought was very destructive.” The justice, who sits in the Matrimonial part in State Supreme Court in Jamaica, Queens, was elected to the Civil Court in 2005 and the State Supreme Court in 2009. Justice Raffaele was among the judges around New York State who volunteered to perform weddings on the Sunday last summer when New York’s same-sex marriage law went into effect. The judge’s description of the confrontation and its aftermath, which he provided in a series of interviews, was corroborated by two people he knows who described the encounter in separate interviews. Justice Raffaele and one of the men, Muhammad Rashid, who runs a tutoring center near where the encounter occurred, said they were on the street at that hour because the judge had spent most of that day and night cleaning out his parents’ house and Mr. Rashid had just helped him move two tables; he donated them to the tutoring center. The judge said his parents had just moved to Houston; he had taken them to the airport that morning and the house’s new owner was to take possession the next day. The judge said he was in “a lot of pain” and went with Mr. Rashid to the emergency room at Elmhurst Hospital Center, where a doctor examined his throat by snaking a tube with a camera on the end through his nose and down his throat to determine whether his trachea had been damaged. The doctor, he said, found no damage; Justice Raffaele was released and told to see his personal doctor for follow-up care. When they first came upon the crowd, the judge said, he was immediately concerned for the officers and called 911. After he made the call, he said, he saw that one of the officers — the one who he said later attacked him — was repeatedly dropping his knee into the handcuffed man’s back. His actions, the judge said, were inflaming the crowd, some of whom had been drinking. But among others who loudly expressed their concern, he said, was a woman who identified herself as a registered nurse; she was calling to the officer, warning that he could seriously hurt the unidentified man, who an official later said was not charged. Justice Raffaele said that after the officer struck him and he regained his composure, he asked another officer who was in charge and was directed to a sergeant, who, like the officer who hit him, was from the 115th Precinct. He told the sergeant that he wanted to make a complaint. The sergeant, he said, stepped away and spoke briefly with some other officers — several of whom the judge said had witnessed their colleague strike him — and returned to tell the judge that none of them knew whom he was talking about. As the sergeant spoke to the other officers, the judge said, the officer who hit him was walking away. At the hospital, he said, he saw another sergeant from the 115th Precinct, who took his complaint. He also telephoned the Police Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau. He said he was interviewed on Friday by a lieutenant and a sergeant from a special unit in the bureau called Group 54, which investigates complaints of excessive force. Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman, said in an e-mail that all force complaints, whether they involve serious injuries or not, are referred to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct that does not rise to the level of a crime. The department’s Internal Affairs Bureau investigates complaints of excessive force that involve serious injuries. “In this instance,” he said, Internal Affairs “is reviewing the complaint because it was brought to its attention by the judge, not because of the level of injury.” He did not respond to an e-mail with other questions about the episode. Police investigators, apparently from Internal Affairs, visited a number of shops along 74th Street on Sunday, seeking to determine whether any had security cameras that might have recorded a fight Thursday night involving a police officer and two men, said Sunil Patel, the owner of Alankar Jewelers. He said that he had security cameras, but that they did not capture any images of the confrontation because the store’s security gate blocks their view when the shop is closed. The office of the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, is working with the Internal Affairs Bureau on the investigation, an official there said. The administrative judge for civil matters for the State Supreme Court in Queens, Jeremy S. Weinstein, who oversees the court where Justice Raffaele sits, said he was surprised to learn of the encounter because of what he said was the judge’s personality. “I think, universally felt, that he is one of the most soft-spoken, thoughtful, decent human beings around,” Justice Weinstein said. “I think his temperament is admired by certainly his colleagues in the bar and I believe the community that he served.” Asked whether he intended to sue, Justice Raffaele said, “At this point, no, I don’t.” He added: “I do feel that it’s important for this person to be disciplined. I don’t know if he should be an officer or not — what he was doing was so violent.”",

    "source": "Mosha, Thai Elephant Wounded by Land Mine, Gets New Prosthetic Limb <eos> BANGKOK — Mosha was 7 months old when she stepped on a land mine near Thailand’s border with Myanmar and lost a front leg. That was a decade ago. This week, she received her ninth artificial leg, thanks to the Friends of the Asian Elephant Foundation hospital in northern Thailand. Mosha is one of more than a dozen elephants who have been wounded by land mines in the border region, where rebels have been fighting the Myanmar government for decades. She was the first elephant to be fitted with a prosthetic limb at the hospital near Lampang. Mosha weighed about 1,300 pounds when she was wounded. Today, she weighs more than 4,000 pounds, and her growth has necessitated frequent upgrades of her artificial leg. Motala, another resident of the hospital, lost a front leg to a land mine in the same border area in 1999. She is now more than 50 years old. “ The Eyes of Thailand ,” a 2012 documentary, featured her being fitted with an artificial limb. Dr. Therdchai Jivacate, a Thai orthopedist who helped design prosthetic limbs for the elephants, said they could not survive without them. “When she cannot walk, she is going to die,” he told The Daily Telegraph in Britain in 2009, when Mosha was fitted with a new prosthesis. When Mosha received her newest artificial limb last week, he told Reuters: “The way she walked was unbalanced, and her spine was going to bend. That means she would have hurt her cartilages badly and eventually stopped walking. And she would have died because of that.” The Thai Elephant Conservation Center estimates that there are 2,000 to 3,000 elephants living in the wild in Thailand and about 2,700 domesticated ones. In the past, many elephants in Thailand worked in the logging industry, where their agility and strength made them a valuable asset. But the Thai government banned logging in the nation’s forests in 1989, putting them out of work.",

    "source": "Sweden Defends Reversal of Warrant for Founder of WikiLeaks <eos> STOCKHOLM — The Swedish prosecutor’s office on Sunday defended its handling of allegations made by two Swedish women against Julian Assange, founder of the WikiLeaks Web site, saying that a senior prosecutor withdrew the arrest warrant that had been issued for Mr. Assange on a rape charge after reviewing a judgment made by a more junior official before additional information became available. The abrupt reversal of the prosecutor’s office had added a new and bizarre turn to events involving Mr. Assange, a 39-year-old Australian. He has been locked in a dispute with the Pentagon over WikiLeaks’ posting last month of 77,000 classified Afghan war documents on the Internet, and its announcement of plans within weeks to post 15,000 additional secret documents that he has described as even “more explosive.” Mr. Assange and others working for WikiLeaks said that “dirty tricks” by those seeking to destroy WikiLeaks were responsible for the developments here on Saturday, when prosecutors first announced that they had issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Assange, then reversed course within hours. The warrant was canceled after the chief prosecutor, Eva Finne, reviewed the case and found that “there is no longer reason to believe that Mr. Assange has committed rape,” in the words of a spokeswoman for the national prosecutor’s office, Karin Rosander. “Another prosecutor was responsible for the matter on Friday,” Mrs. Rosander said Sunday in a telephone interview. “During Saturday, a new prosecutor took over, and new information came to light. When she looked into the matter, she found there was no reason to suspect” Mr. Assange of rape, and therefore no need for the arrest warrant. Mrs. Rosander said a separate allegation against Mr. Assange that was cited in the prosecutor’s original statement on Saturday, involving molestation, remained under investigation. “The prosecutor will begin looking into the matter tomorrow, and she estimates that she will make a decision in the coming week,” she said. The prosecutor’s office did not feel that an accusation of molestation — a term that covers a wide range of offenses under Swedish law, including inappropriate physical contact with another adult — was enough to justify an arrest warrant, Mrs. Rosander said. A molestation conviction carries a possible fine, or up to a year in prison. Pending further investigation into the molestation claim, Mrs. Rosander said, the police have been trying, so far unsuccessfully, to “find” Mr. Assange, who has remained elusive since arriving in Sweden 10 days ago from Britain. He had said he hoped to establish a secure base for himself and WikiLeaks in Sweden because its press laws provide broad protections for news organizations that publish secret information. The Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet has agreed to take on Mr. Assange as a columnist in an arrangement that would qualify him for such protections. Mr. Assange has told reporters in recent weeks that he believes he and other WikiLeaks activists are at risk of being arrested, or being singled out in other ways, in the wake of WikiLeaks’ release of the Pentagon documents. Early Sunday, Mr. Assange responded to efforts by The New York Times to contact him with a brief e-mail to a reporter in which he described the sexual abuse accusations as “completely baseless, as I always said.” Previously, he had responded to the Swedish accusations in Twitter feeds, a form of communication he has favored in recent weeks in his effort to disguise his whereabouts. On Twitter, he implied that the accusations were payback for WikiLeaks’ disclosures. “We were warned to expect ‘dirty tricks,’ ” he said. “Now, we have the first one.” In its Sunday editions, Aftonbladet quoted Mr. Assange as saying that the rape claims had caused damage even though they had been dropped because WikiLeaks’ “enemies” could use them to discredit the organization. “I do not know what lies behind this. But we have been warned that, for example, the Pentagon plans to use dirty tricks to undermine us,” Mr. Assange was quoted as saying in a phone interview from Sweden. “And I have also been warned about sex traps.” The Pentagon press secretary, Geoff Morrell, said Sunday that any suggestion that the Pentagon was involved in the allegations was “absurd.” Aftonbladet also quoted a woman who it said made the accusation of molestation as saying: “The accusations against Assange are, of course, not orchestrated by the Pentagon or anybody else. Responsibility for what happened to myself and the other girl lies with a man who has a skewed attitude to women and a problem taking no for an answer.” The newspaper did not identify the woman.",

    "source": "Egyptian Soldiers Chase and Beat Unarmed Civilians in Cairo <eos> CAIRO — Egypt ’s military rulers escalated a bloody crackdown on street protesters on Saturday, chasing down and beating unarmed civilians, even while the prime minister was denying in a televised news conference that security forces were using any force. In one of the most incendiary developments, video cameras captured soldiers stripping the clothes off women they were beating on the pavement of Tahrir Square. The contradiction in the military-led government’s statements and actions appeared to represent a shift in strategy by the military council. After trying for months to preserve some credibility and collaboration with the Egyptian political elite, the ruling generals on Saturday scarcely acknowledged the demands made by their newly appointed civilian advisory council the night before that the military cease its violence and apologize to demonstrators. Instead, as the crackdown entered its second day, the military council appeared to be playing to those Egyptians impatient with the continuing protests and eager for a return to stability. Crowds of supporters turned out downtown on Saturday morning to cheer on the military police, hand them drinks of water and help them close off Tahrir Square from demonstrators massing to get in. Protesters, for their part, charged that the military rulers were provoking the clashes to derail or discredit the continuing election of a new Parliament that could challenge their power. “The military council is responsible for everything that happens,” Ziad el-Elaimy, a newly elected member of Parliament who was beaten Friday by the military police, said in a television interview. The prime minister, Kamal Ganzouri, issued his denial that the military had or would use force in a news conference on Saturday morning after more than 24 hours of street fighting in front of the military-occupied Parliament building that left 10 dead from gunshots and hundreds wounded. For most of the previous day and night, men in plain clothes, accompanied by a few in uniform, stood on top of the “people’s assembly” and hurled chunks of concrete and stone taken from inside the building down at the crowd of demonstrators several stories below. A few men in uniform were seen with them. On Saturday morning, a parliamentary building on Tahrir Square that houses a historical archive burst into flames. It was unclear who started the blaze; the military-led government blamed the protesters, while they blamed the military. Around the same time, several witnesses said, hundreds of military police officers in riot gear finally chased the demonstrators from in front of the Parliament building into Tahrir Square and then out into the side streets. They burned down a small tent city, leaving the square in flames for hours and sending a thick plume of black smoke curling over downtown. As they charged, soldiers used clubs to beat anyone they could catch. A video shown on a private Egyptian television network in the morning showed several military police officers using batons to beat civilians as they lay on the ground of Tahrir Square, and one appeared to be unconscious. Several videos on the Internet and Egyptian television showed soldiers tearing the clothes off women as they beat them in Tahrir Square. At least one of the women was wearing the traditional hijab veil and covering before she was stripped; she lay unmoving while a soldier lifted his boot to kick her bare midriff. Mohamed ElBaradei, a leading liberal and former United Nations atomic energy chief, addressed a public message to the military council over the Internet: “Did you see the pictures of the military police dragging girls and stripping them of their clothes? Aren’t you ashamed? Let me remind you: justice is above power.” Passers-by were caught up as well. A young woman getting off a bus and trying to catch a taxi to work was grabbed by soldiers and thrown to the ground, before a group of people rescued her and tucked her into a passing vehicle. As the military police were charging the square, Mr. Ganzouri, the military-appointed prime minister and a former prime minister under the ousted president, Hosni Mubarak, was declaring at his televised news conference that the only acts of violence were arson and vandalism committed by the protesters. Contradicting the accounts of civilian witnesses, he said that soldiers had come out on Friday only to protect the Parliament and cabinet buildings. He acknowledged several deaths from bullet wounds, but in an echo of the Mubarak government’s public relations, blamed unnamed third parties and said no one in the military had fired a weapon. “The events taking place in the streets aren’t a revolution,” he said. “They’re an attack on the revolution.” When a journalist asked about the widespread reports of indiscriminate beatings by military police, Mr. Ganzouri upbraided him: “Don’t repeat what you saw in media. Don’t say violence, there was no violence. What does your conscience tell you?” In a separate statement, the military council said that the soldiers had charged into Tahrir Square in self-defense after “thugs” had shot at military officers. “We have never and we will never target the revolutionaries of Egypt,” the statement said, adding that the protests “were not met with anything except self-control until the last escalation, which compelled stopping those outlaws.” In another statement late in the afternoon, the military rulers responded to the demands of their civilian advisory council by expressing “sorrow” over the bloody events of the previous day. The statement said the military was taking “all necessary measures” to stop the violence by building a concrete barrier dividing the protesters from the security guards protecting the Parliament and cabinet buildings. It pledged that an investigation would reveal “the reality of the situation.” The statement, however, fell short of the apology the council had demanded. And it suggested that the military-led government had been a powerless neutral bystander during the deadly clashes of the night before, even though much of the violence directed at the demonstrators, including the rain of rocks from atop the Parliament building, had come from areas under the military’s control. Many civilian critics of the military rulers argue that the government should be able to disperse an unruly crowd without killing people. Elsewhere in the city, thousands turned out to mourn a religious scholar from Al Azhar, the premier center of Sunni Muslim scholarship, who was killed the day before. “Yes, we are chanting inside Al Azhar, down with military rule,” mourners intoned during a funeral procession. The procession had swelled to several thousand by the time it reached Tahrir Square in the early evening, and its arrival swelled the crowd. “Every bullet makes us stronger,” they chanted. The military police by then had retreated from the square to behind a newly erected barricade between the square and Parliament, but they continued to exchange volleys of rocks with protesters on the other side. After nightfall, the military police began discharging what appeared to be fireworks at the protesters as well. There were reports that new protests against military rule had also broken out in Alexandria, Egypt’s second-largest city. There were signs, however, that at least some Egyptians were ready to side with the military against the disruption of more protests. A call-in show on a private television station interviewed a woman with a heavily bandaged head who told the story of her beating by the military police on Friday morning. But most of the viewers who called in criticized her instead of the military, urging her to go home and stop ruining the country. In the chaos on the downtown streets on Saturday, it was easy to overhear similar arguments. “Why are you here?” one man asked another near the burning archive. “I feel bad for the people who were killed, I feel bad for the sheik from Al Azhar,” came the answer. “But I can’t cross the square when I am going to work,” the first man implored. “You are delaying life.”",

    "source": "Iran’s Leader of Opposition Assails ‘Cult’ of Rulers <eos> One of Iran ’s opposition leaders, Mir Hussein Moussavi , said Saturday that a dictatorial “cult” was ruling Iran — one of his most critical statements against the country’s rulers since disputed elections last summer. “This is the rule of a cult that has hijacked the concept of Iranianism and nationalism,” Mr. Moussavi said in the interview posted on his Web site, Kalameh. “Our people cannot tolerate such behavior under the name of religion.” The statements appear to be part of a renewed campaign by the opposition’s leadership to prove that they are still vital, despite a brutal crackdown by the government and their inability to bring masses of people to the streets in a recent planned protest. Last week, another opposition leader, Mehdi Karroubi, called for a national referendum to gauge the popularity of the government. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, followed with a statement dismissing the possibility of any compromise with the opposition, saying those who refused to accept the results of the June 12 election had no right to participate in politics. Both Mr. Moussavi and Mr. Karroubi ran in the election, which the government says was won by the incumbent, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . The authorities claimed recently that the poor showing by the opposition at its planned rally on Feb. 11 showed that the government had managed to end the mass protests that had continued sporadically since the summer. The opposition had difficulty mobilizing in good part because the government had undertaken a widespread clampdown starting weeks before, and bused in tens of thousands of government forces. But the relatively small showing by antigovernment protesters also led to some soul- searching among the opposition, which has been re-examining its tactics and struggling to find a new catalyst for its movement.",

    "source": "CIT Leaves Bankruptcy With Less Debt but Many Questions <eos> The CIT Group, which started out in 1908, financing horse-drawn carriages, survived for a century before sinking into bankruptcy. But it took just 38 days for the company, one of the biggest lenders to small and midsize companies, to pull itself out of bankruptcy, a feat that, only months ago, seemed almost impossible. CIT went bust despite a $2.3 billion lifeline from Washington — money that was vaporized in its bankruptcy. On Thursday, it will enter its post-bankruptcy era with less debt but some big questions about its future. CIT’s leaders have pledged to refashion the company and reduce its reliance on short-term debt, which proved disastrous when the credit markets froze over last year. Although the company’s stock will not officially begin trading until Thursday morning, people close to the company said that premarket trading has priced the shares at about $27 each, valuing CIT at $5.4 billion. The company has shed $10.5 billion worth of debt. Its old shares, currently trading under the ticker symbol CITGQ, are expected to become worthless. CIT’s emergence from bankruptcy underscores the recovery in the financial markets and the broader financial industry. Its reorganization plan, a months-long affair orchestrated during many late nights and hours of conference calls, relies on money from private investors, with virtually no aid from regulators. It also proved that a financial firm could survive the challenges of bankruptcy court, which many financial analysts thought unlikely. “It’s an enormous achievement to have gotten the vote that you’ve gotten,” Allan L. Gropper, the federal bankruptcy judge overseeing CIT’s case, said this week in approving the reorganization plan. Still, taxpayers’ investment in CIT was wiped out by the bankruptcy, in the first realized loss in the government’s $700 billion financial rescue plan. Banking analysts say other losses may follow. And Jeffrey M. Peek, CIT’s chief executive and the architect of its ill-fated expansion, intends to step down at year-end, as the company cedes control to its creditors. CIT has hired executive search firms to find his successor and new board members. Over the last five months, Mr. Peek and his management team, together with their advisers, sweated through negotiations with creditors and lenders to come up with a survival plan. More than a half-dozen executives involved in those negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the talks, retraced how the company nearly died before scraping together a rescue. Since becoming a bank holding company last December, CIT believed that it could reform itself through access to government programs available to other financial firms, including the issuing of debt backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But a brief phone call to Mr. Peek on July 14 from William L. Rutledge of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, denying federal assistance, took company executives by surprise — and sent them scrambling. Senior executives, who had assured clients that CIT would receive government aid, had to go back to companies like Dunkin’ Donuts, asking them how much money they needed today versus waiting a day, a week or more. In CIT’s boardroom in Midtown Manhattan, advisers kept a daily tally of the company’s dwindling cash levels on a whiteboard. With $1 billion in bonds maturing in August, CIT and its advisers approached several banks about receiving a $3 billion loan, and by late Thursday, July 16, believed they had secured financing from a group led by JPMorgan Chase. But the next day, JPMorgan informed the company that it did not have enough time to conduct proper due diligence and would not risk making a loan so close to an imminent bankruptcy filing. Jeffrey Aronson, a co-founder of Centerbridge Partners, an investment firm with a big position in CIT’s debt, later met with Mr. Peek and suggested that a group of about six large bondholders would be willing to supply an emergency loan. As CIT’s troubles grew, its major bondholders warmed to the idea of a prepackaged bankruptcy, a specific type of Chapter 11 filing that usually takes no more than two months in court and would give the company breathing room on its debt load and bond maturities. If enough bondholders supported the so-called prepack, company officials reasoned, CIT’s troubles could be solved much more quickly and elegantly. Treasury officials had expressed concern about what would happen to the government’s investment in CIT, since the preferred stock it held would almost certainly be wiped out in a bankruptcy filing. But the officials decided to stand down from a fight, opting instead to act like a normal investor. The result was a large debt-for-equity exchange offer, coupled with a solicitation of votes for a prepackaged bankrtupcy. Yet CIT officials and advisers were still consumed by a dozen other issues, including negotiating with Goldman Sachs over preserving a $2.13 billion loan made in 2008, which carried a more attractive interest rate than the company could get at that time. Only the intercession of the CIT bondholder committee helped Goldman and the company to reach a deal. By Oct. 26, CIT had appeased the concerns of major bondholders and rebuffed a challenge by Carl C. Icahn, who had acquired about $2 billion of CIT bonds.",

    "source": "Though Hobbled, North Carolina Gets by Virginia Tech <eos> ATLANTA — On the grease board in the North Carolina locker room, written in blue, of course, was a simple message for the Tar Heels from Coach Roy Williams: “Find a way.” It could have easily said, “Find a different way.” The No. 1 Tar Heels (28-3) played their quarterfinal game of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament Friday without point guard Ty Lawson, the A.C.C. player of the year, the engine of the best fast break in college basketball, who is sidelined with an injured right toe. So Carolina found another, slower gear and held off desperate Virginia Tech (18-14) for a 79-76 victory before 26,352 in the Georgia Dome. Instead of racing the floor for points, the Tar Heels were merciless in pounding the Hokies inside. Tyler Hansbrough, the 6-foot-9 senior forward, scored 28 points and collected 8 rebounds. Deon Thompson, a 6-8 junior forward, and Ed Davis, a 6-10 freshman forward, combined for 22 points on 9-of-16 shooting. The senior guard Bobby Frasor, who started in place of Lawson, played a career-high 37 minutes and had one turnover. He did not try to be like Lawson; he just moved the ball around the perimeter until it found its way inside. “It’s nice to have other guys step up and not rely on him, so when he’s out we can score without him, get the ball inside and still win,” Frasor said. In the Carolina locker room after the game, Lawson did not sound anxious to get back on the floor, especially with the Tar Heels focused on the N.C.A.A tournament and winning the national championship that eluded them last season, when they lost in the semifinals. Lawson said he was not sure if he would play in the A.C.C. semifinals Saturday against Florida State, which held off Georgia Tech, 64-62, in another quarterfinal. “It’s tough to walk on it, that’s why I have this big boot,” Lawson said. “This tournament matters, too. We have a streak going of two A.C.C. tournaments in a row, but the N.C.A.A. tournament is the bigger goal.” Teams that are not making the N.C.A.A. tournament will lament losing games after not making vital plays — a shot, a defensive stop, a free throw — in the last minute. But North Carolina has Hansbrough, who influenced the outcome against the Hokies with three plays in the final seconds. Virginia Tech trailed, 77-76, when it got the ball in the lane with less than six seconds to play. Hansbrough reached in and put a big hand on top of the ball, which tied up the Hokies’ J. T. Thompson and forced a jump ball. The possession arrow went to Carolina. The ball was inbounded to Hansbrough, who was fouled. He made two free throws with 4.6 seconds to play, making the score 79-76. Tech’s A. D. Vassallo tossed up a desperation 3-point attempt, with Hansbrough jumping at him, but it was an air ball. The Hokies probably needed a victory to get into the N.C.A.A. tournament, but may have to settle for the National Invitation Tournament. Apparently dismayed, Virginia Tech Coach Seth Greenberg walked out of the Georgia Dome resigned that his team will not be in the N.C.A.A. tournament despite eight victories in a tough conference. Greenberg knew the difference was not winning a close game down the stretch of the season, so he will go watch his daughter’s volleyball game, he said, then maybe the announcement of the tournament pairings. “It’s one stop, it’s one rebound, it’s one 50-50 ball,” Greenberg said. “It’s not just for us, it’s for other teams, too.” Carolina, meanwhile, will be a No. 1 seed for the N.C.A.A. tournament, regardless of whether it wins the A.C.C. tournament. “Tyler told me a couple of weeks ago he wished the N.C.A.A. tournament was here,” Frasor said.",

    "source": "Two Top Men Are Pushed to the Limit at U.S. Open <eos> By the end of the day, it seemed that all was as it should be. In the three marquee matches played during the day session at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the favorites defeated lesser-ranked opponents and advanced in the United States Open. But that did not mean that victory came easily. Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, the second and third seeds, battled through five sets apiece to squeak by their opponents and into the quarterfinals. Only Elena Dementieva, the No. 5 seed and the women’s singles gold medalist at the Beijing Olympics, easily dispatched her challenger, defeating Patty Schnyder in two sets to advance to the semifinals. In a match that lasted 3 hours 32 minutes, Federer defeated Igor Andreev, the No. 23 seed, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (5), 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. Federer, who has won the past four Opens, dropped the first set for the first time in the Open this year. “He broke me so easily in the first game that he just made it harder,” Federer said in a courtside interview after the match. “I was just trying to stay in the match. It was really close in the second set. That was key for me to get back into the match.” Andreev, a Russian, also identified the second set as crucial. “It was, I think, a very important moment, beginning of second set where I have few break points on his serve,” he said. “It was, like, problem for him to return to make points on my serve.” The match eventually went to a fifth set, and a turning point came when Federer broke Andreev’s serve to take a 2-0 lead. With Federer seemingly in control, the drama returned at 4-2, when Andreev failed to convert on four break points in a game that went to deuce six times. Federer attacked the net, winning 58 of 84 net approaches, including 15 of 19 in the fifth set. Andreev won 12 of his 28 net approaches. Federer attributed his net play to his gold medal victory in doubles at the Olympics. “We don’t have that many guys at the net anymore,” Federer said, adding that after winning last month in Beijing, “I’m a little more confident in that.” But Federer also led in unforced errors, committing 60 to Andreev’s 42. Despite Federer’s record at the Open, skeptics had wondered if he was up to the challenge this year after losing to Rafael Nadal in the finals at Wimbledon and the French Open and after surrendering his No. 1 ranking to Nadal last month. Federer insisted that a five-set match, even given his performance this season, was more fun than stressful. “Being part of these dogfights is fun for me,” he said. Federer will face Gilles Muller of Luxembourg, a qualifier who upset the No. 5 seed, Nikolay Davydenko, in the quarterfinals. Federer laughed when he was asked if he was concerned about Muller because Muller had nothing to lose. “It’s been that way for four and a half years,” Federer said. “This is just a guy who’s got even less to lose.” Djokovic’s victory was also hard-won. After struggling against the 15th-seeded Tommy Robredo in five sets and nearly four hours of play, the third-seeded Djokovic laughed about being unsteady on his feet in a brief courtside interview. “I need to stand next to the net, otherwise I will fall down,” Djokovic said. He prevailed, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3, but only after calling a trainer to examine him for an injured right hip and a turned right ankle. Robredo did not escape unscathed, either, tumbling in the fifth set with the score tied at 2-2. Djokovic advanced to the quarterfinals; he will meet the winner of the Andy Roddick-Fernando González match, which was played Tuesday night. Djokovic said did not feel well when he woke up Tuesday morning, blaming a late-night match Sunday against Marin Cilic. He said adrenaline from the match with Cilic kept him up until 4:30 a.m. on Monday. “I didn’t feel well,” Djokovic said. “The moment I stepped on the court, I felt already, as you said, less energy in the tank.” His claim of multiple ailments drew skepticism from Robredo, who said after the match that he was hurting, too. “I have pain, as well,” Robredo said. “I was running like hell and my feet were burning, but I say nothing, no? I think that if you’re not fit enough, then don’t play.” Robredo seemed to come into his own in the fourth set, breaking serve to tie it at 3-3. The crowd was behind him, cheering his clever shots and booing Djokovic when he threw down his racket in disgust. In the fourth set, Djokovic said he began to doubt himself. “I didn’t know if I was able to continue going on that high level, and he was just getting into the game more and more,” he said. But he somehow found that level and moved into the quarterfinals. If the Djokovic and Federer victories came after long brawls, the Dementieva match ended more predictably. She continued her Olympic bounce by beating Schnyder, 6-2, 6-3. Dementieva won 80 percent of her serves. Schnyder squandered her only chance to take the lead in the second set. After breaking serve to tie the set at 3-3, she failed to hold hers in the next game and Dementieva took the lead. “It was a very, very important moment for me to break her again,” said Dementieva, who will play the No. 2 seed, Jelena Jankovic, in the semifinals. “I’m very happy that I was able to do this.”",

    "source": "Fuzzy Critters With High Prices Offer Lesson in New Concepts <eos> IF the face of e-commerce 1.0 was the Pets.com sock puppet, will the new face of e-commerce be a Webkinz? The cuddly stuffed animals, which are in exceedingly high demand among the elementary school set, have also gained notice among Internet executives for their ability to bridge the online and offline worlds. And although no one expects others to replicate the breakaway success of Webkinz in, say, the automotive industry, analysts said there are many lessons to be learned from these plush toys. “There’s an opportunity here to change the way retailers, manufacturers and media companies think about new concepts,” said Kenneth Cassar, an analyst with Nielsen//NetRatings, an Internet consulting group. “They need to challenge themselves to pursue new products and offerings without the burden of thinking as either an offline product or online product first.” Webkinz, which are manufactured by the privately held Ganz Corporation in Woodbridge, Ontario, break that mold by existing simultaneously in the child’s room and on Webkinz World ( Webkinz.com ). Each of the roughly 45 Webkinz animals, which sell for about $11 at retail (if you can find them), comes with its own avatar that lives on the site. Webkinz World is a cross between an online gaming site, an educational site and the virtual world of Second Life, but with animals instead of people. Youngsters may also use the site for text chats with friends with whom they have shared their online identity. The idea for Webkinz, she said, came from Howard Ganz, the company’s chief executive. “He wanted to pay attention to what kids are doing these days, and what they’re doing is going online,” said Susan McVeigh, a Ganz spokeswoman. (Mr. Ganz declined an interview request.) Ganz, which introduced Webkinz in April 2005, stopped publicly commenting on sales last year as the toys approached the 1 million mark. Since then, their popularity has spiked, with stores across the nation struggling to maintain inventory and eBay sellers demanding a steep premium for certain animals, like Sherbet the rabbit, which sold last week for about $40. Some discontinued Webkinz have been sold on eBay for well over $100, and an eBay auction for a dog and cat set that closed yesterday attracted a winning bid of $1,525. Patrick Yap, manager of B Chemist, a department store and pharmacy in Manhattan that sells toys, said he has more than 700 back orders for Webkinz. “I’m taking orders for July shipments right now,” he said. “This is bigger than Beanie Babies. With those you’re playing all by yourself. With these, you can do that, too, but you can also go on the site and chit-chat with your friends.” That is precisely the point, Ms. McVeigh said. “They get to choose how they play,” she said. “This takes everything a child loves about a plush toy — the nurturing of it, the fantasy of raising your pet — and brings it to the next level, where in the interactive world you really do look after it.” Since last April, the site has risen from 325,000 unique visitors to 2.8 million last month, according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Time spent per user has dropped off dramatically since April, when the average user logged nearly three hours per month on the site. Now the average is 11 minutes. Ms. McVeigh, of Ganz, speculates that the average may have dropped because parents may be limiting the time their children spend on the site. Mr. Cassar, of Nielsen//NetRatings said the Webkinz craze underscores the fact that the nation’s roughly 160 million Internet users spend just 26.5 hours per month online, or 5 percent of their non-sleeping hours. “But Internet-based and Internet-enabled technologies are beginning to transform the way we live the other 95 percent of our lives,” he said. “That’s a trend that may ultimately be far more important than what we do within the narrow slice of our days that we actually spend on the Web.” Online companies like Craigslist, Match.com, Meetup and Monster.com facilitate offline activity. Offline companies like Wal-Mart, Target and Gap have extended their sales online. Video game companies like Xbox now allow players to compete against others online. These companies have effectively built bridges between the offline and online worlds, Mr. Cassar said, but Webkinz is unusual in that it began as a product that “existed equally prominently in the real world and the virtual world. Other companies need to challenge themselves to pursue new products and offerings without the burden of thinking as either an offline product or an online product first.” Judging by Meetup’s recent growth, adult Internet users, too, are more actively integrating the Web with their offline lives. The company, which provides an online service that helps groups organize and meet offline, has seen a sharp upturn in business this quarter. Users are on pace to conduct more than three times the number of meetings they did in the first quarter of 2006, according to Scott Heiferman, Meetup’s chief executive, and company revenues have spiked by about 40 percent in the last three months alone. Meetup, which is privately held and based in Manhattan, does not disclose actual revenue figures, but Mr. Heiferman said it is on pace to organize roughly 75,000 meetings this quarter. The business recently began exploring an advertising model to help capitalize on the fact that marketers are increasingly interested in small communities that are passionate about a particular subject or activity. Mr. Heiferman said Webkinz is “a brilliant idea,” in that it melds the online and offline worlds. His own company’s approach, though, is different in that it appeals to people who may have had enough of exclusively online connections. “We’re living our lives more and more in front of a screen,” Mr. Heiferman said. “You can easily go through a good part of life just looking at your iPod , your cellphone, the computer, the TV, and I think there’s a feeling of, ‘O.K., I need the real world and real people and real teddy bears and real community.’ ”",

    "source": "Mayor Bill de Blasio Takes a Day to Pursue a National Profile <eos> WASHINGTON — For Mayor Bill de Blasio , it was a day when New York City seemed very far away. He shared a morning flight to Washington with Loretta E. Lynch, the nominee for attorney general, before heading to the White House for a meeting with Valerie Jarrett, who is President Obama’s closest adviser. At a breakfast, the mayor warned fellow Democrats to worry about the “authenticity” of Senator Rand Paul, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, and he urged Hillary Rodham Clinton, his former boss, to shift her policies leftward, adding that he would be “honored” to advise her in a presidential run. After 11 months in office, Mr. de Blasio has no dearth of headaches at home: bumpy poll numbers, the departure of a key aide under a cloud of personal problems, and a tendency toward tardiness that led him to miss the most important moment of a memorial service last week for victims of a plane crash. But on Wednesday, touring the nation’s capital for the second time in just over a month, the mayor looked undeterred in his efforts to promote himself in a loftier role: as a leader of the American left. “I think most voters now see themselves as stuck or falling backward economically,” Mr. de Blasio told Mike Allen of Politico in a breakfast interview here. “I don’t want to be hackneyed, but I think the American dream has ceased to function for a lot of families.” A sojourn to Washington is not unusual for New York mayors, and it can be a helpful way to burnish one’s profile while distracting from local vexations. In the Politico interview, Mr. de Blasio laughed off mocking New York Post headlines while offering himself as a guru for the Democratic Party , instructing its potential presidential candidates in 2016 to embrace the fight against income inequality that propelled his own ascent to City Hall. Those who might question the mayor’s certitude received a bracing riposte. Asked about a poll that showed a yawning racial divide in his approval rating, Mr. de Blasio suggested the survey, by Quinnipiac University, was based on a skewed sample. “I question whether they are getting the totality of the citizens of our city,” the mayor said. And Mr. de Blasio opined that coverage of Rachel Noerdlinger, who took a leave of absence this week as chief of staff to the first lady, Chirlane McCray, after revelations about ethical lapses and a boyfriend with a serious criminal past, was motivated by news outlets looking to “promote a worldview.” Image Mr. de Blasio sat down with Mike Allen of Politico for an interview. Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times “The essence is what matters, not the tabloid headlines,” the mayor said, adding that New Yorkers would ignore stories he deemed “counterproductive.” Mr. de Blasio ended his day among friends, at a Center for American Progress event, where he was a featured speaker along with liberal A-listers like Julián Castro, the federal housing secretary, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. Prominent Democrats said there was curiosity in Washington to hear from the liberal who wrested City Hall back 20 years after the last Democratic mayor. “His campaign was masterful,” said Edward G. Rendell, a former Philadelphia mayor and Democratic national chairman. “He talked about progressive values and he won an overwhelming victory.” Mr. Rendell added, “The governmental struggles that he’s had don’t eliminate the fact that his campaign message was a very effective one.” The mayor’s visit, although carefully choreographed by his aides, was not without some surprises. Asked by Mr. Allen about his marijuana habits, Mr. de Blasio said he had not used the drug since college. He also said that living in Gracie Mansion could be isolating and that he returned to his gym in Park Slope, Brooklyn, on weekends. At one point, Mr. de Blasio, who warned against Wall Street’s excesses in his mayoral campaign, praised Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, for calling attention to income inequality. (Mr. Blankfein is on a committee for New York’s bid to host the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Brooklyn; Mr. de Blasio said on Wednesday that $10 million in commitments had already been secured.) Mr. de Blasio cautioned that Senator Paul, Republican of Kentucky, should not be underestimated as a presidential contender, saying he “evinces a certain authenticity that any good Democrat should worry about.” And asked by Mr. Allen about the best perks of his job, Mr. de Blasio, a passionate fan of Italian dining, cited a culinary benefit. “You can get into restaurants really easily,” the mayor said to laughter, adding, “I thought, oh my God, I can probably get into Rao’s now.”",

    "source": "Corporate Lawyers Say They Are Spending More In-House <eos> Chief legal officers at corporations in 41 countries say they are spending more — and hiring more staff members — in-house, according to a new study by the Association of Corporate Counsel, a legal professionals membership group, that asked 1,300 corporate lawyers and chief legal officers. The rise is being driven by more government regulatory scrutiny as corporate dealings become increasingly multinational, according to the group’s report . One-third of those responding said their companies had been the target of regulators in the last two years. One in three corporate lawyers said their companies had been targeted by regulators in the last two years, “reflecting the additional risk companies are exposed to as they increase their cross-border work and face a wider range of government scrutiny,” said Veta T. Richardson, the association’s president and chief executive. While multinationals are still outsourcing complex litigation, “corporate law departments are spending more on internal budgets than on law firms or other external legal service providers,” the association’s 2016 study found. Currently, 53 percent of the legal budget is being spent internally and 47 percent is being spent on outside legal help, the study found. Corporate legal departments are focusing on ethics and compliance issues along with regulatory concerns and data breaches, which were experienced by some 22 percent of companies in the study. That means that legal staffing has more than doubled at nearly half of the corporations, said the association, which has more than 40,000 in-house lawyers in 85 countries as members. The association said the explosive rise in its membership reflected the growing number of legal professionals at corporations. Nonetheless, 61 percent of the chief legal officers predicted that the total amount of work going to outside legal providers would remain the same in the coming year. Corporations are continuing to take a harder look at what they spend for outside law firms, and the respondents who expected to reduce outsourcing said they would increase the number of in-house lawyers in their departments in the coming year.",

    "source": "Geronimo’s Heirs Sue Secret Yale Society Over His Skull <eos> HOUSTON — The descendants of Geronimo have sued Skull and Bones, a secret society at Yale University with ties to the Bush family, charging that its members robbed his grave in 1918 and have kept his skull in a glass case ever since. The claim is part of a lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington on Tuesday, the 100th anniversary of Geronimo’s death. The Apache warrior’s heirs are seeking to recover all his remains, wherever they may be, and have them transferred to a new grave at the headwaters of the Gila River in New Mexico, where Geronimo was born and wished to be interred. “I believe strongly from my heart that his spirit was never released,” Geronimo’s great-grandson Harlyn Geronimo, 61, told reporters Tuesday at the National Press Club. Geronimo died a prisoner of war at Fort Sill, Okla., in 1909. A longstanding tradition among members of Skull and Bones holds that Prescott S. Bush — father of President George Bush and grandfather of President George W. Bush — broke into the grave with some classmates during World War I and made off with the skull, two bones, a bridle and some stirrups, all of which were put on display at the group’s clubhouse in New Haven, known as the Tomb. The story gained some validity in 2005, when a historian discovered a letter written in 1918 from one Skull and Bones member to another saying the skull had been taken from a grave at Fort Sill along with several pieces of tack for a horse. Ramsey Clark, a former United States attorney general who is representing Geronimo’s family, acknowledged he had no hard proof that the story was true. Yet he said he hoped the court would clear up the matter. Tom Conroy, a spokesman for Yale, declined to comment on the lawsuit but was quick to note that the Tomb was not on university property. Members of the Skull and Bones, who guard their organization’s secrecy, could not be reached for comment. Though the society is not officially affiliated with the university, many of Yale’s most powerful alumni are members, among them both Bush presidents and Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. “Of all the items rumored to be in the Skull and Bones’s possession, Geronimo’s skull is one of the more plausible ones,” said Alexandra Robbins, the author of “Secrets of the Tomb” (Little Brown 2002), a book about the society. “There is a skull encased in a glass display when you walk in the door of the Tomb, and they call it Geronimo.” Some local historians and anthropologists in Oklahoma have cast doubt on the tale, noting that no independent evidence has been found to suggest that Geronimo’s grave was disturbed in 1918. Ten years later, the army covered the grave with concrete and replaced a simple wooden headstone with a stone monument, making it nearly impregnable. Geronimo, whose given name was Goyathlay, put up fierce resistance to white settlers, fighting the Mexican and United States armies for nearly three decades. He finally surrendered, with only 35 men left, to Gen. Nelson A. Miles on the New Mexico-Arizona border in 1886 and spent the rest of his life in prison, dying of pneumonia. Not all Apaches want to move his remains to New Mexico. The branch of the tribe that settled at Fort Sill after Geronimo died is fighting to keep the grave where it is. “There is nothing to be gained by digging up the dead,” said Jeff Houser, the chairman of the Fort Sill Apache Tribe. “It will not repair the damage to the tribe caused by its removal and imprisonment.”",

    "source": "Commercials With a Gay Emphasis Are Moving to Mainstream Media <eos> WHEN Expedia decided to begin running on television this month a commercial it had introduced online in October, about a father’s trip to attend his daughter’s wedding to another woman, the media plan was drawn up to include Logo , the cable channel aimed at gay and lesbian viewers. But the commercial is also running on networks watched by general audiences, like CNN, History, MSNBC and the National Geographic Channel. “As we were making our Web site more personal, we wanted to get back to the idea that travel is really personal,” said Sarah Gavin, director for public relations and social media at Expedia in Seattle, and “equality is a core part of who we are.” The Expedia decision is indicative of a significant change in how marketers are disseminating ads with so-called L.G.B.T. themes, for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. For the last two or three decades, such ads were usually aimed at L.G.B.T. consumers, placed in media those consumers watch and read, and then supplemented with tactics that included event marketing like floats in Pride Month parades. Recently, however, L.G.B.T. ads have been getting broader exposure. While targeted media and events remain part of the game plan, they are also running in mainstream media that, in addition to general cable channels, include magazines like Family Circle, newspapers like The New York Times and social media like Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter and YouTube. One goal is to reach families, friends and straight allies of L.G.B.T. consumers. “I have friends who are gay who said, ‘I sent this to my mother,’ ‘I sent this to my father,’ ” Ms. Gavin said of the Expedia commercial, which was created by the Los Angeles office of 180, part of the Omnicom Group. “We wanted to start a conversation.” Another goal is to signal support for L.G.B.T. consumers as they seek civil rights in areas like immigration and marriage. Although “niche media remain an important part of the mix,” said Billy Kolber, publisher and creative director of Man About World , a gay travel magazine for the iPad, “it’s more impactful when you see an ad in mainstream media because it says these companies are willing to offer public support.” The list of marketers that are casting a wider net with their L.G.B.T. ads reads like a Who’s Who of Madison Avenue. In addition to Expedia, they include Amazon, American Airlines, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Bloomingdale’s, Crate & Barrel, Gap, General Mills, Google, Hyatt, JetBlue Airways , Kraft Foods, Johnson & Johnson, MasterCard, Microsoft, J. C. Penney and Redhook Ale Brewery. “As society becomes more diverse, there’s more inclusive messaging, which reflects what society actually looks like,” said Michael Wilke, executive director of the AdRespect Advertising Educational Program, which works with marketers on L.G.B.T. representation in campaigns. Image The Lucky Charms mascot at the Twin Cities Pride Family Picnic in St. Paul. Credit Andy Berndt/Street Factory Media “It’s not about being inclusive to stand out,” he added. “It’s about being inclusive to blend in.” And “it’s particularly a no-brainer when you look at younger consumers,” Mr. Wilke said, who, according to polls, are far more accepting of diversity than their elders to the point where they expect to see ads that celebrate acceptance. A play on words centered on “acceptance” is the focus of a campaign under way from MasterCard Worldwide, which offers a hashtag, #AcceptanceMatters, and includes material on Facebook along with Twitter. “We think it will resonate with a lot of different people,” said JR Badian, vice president and senior business leader for U.S. digital marketing and social media at MasterCard Worldwide in Purchase, N.Y. “This gives us the opportunity to be targeted as well as bring the message to a larger audience.” The MasterCard campaign, which is being handled by R/GA in New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, is composed of social media and event marketing. “We’ll see how the conversation is liked and shared,” Mr. Badian said, “and if we could extend it out to traditional media.” Like MasterCard’s effort, an L.G.B.T. campaign for Lucky Charms cereal, sold by General Mills, is composed of social media and event marketing. The agencies in the Lucky Charms campaign, which carries the theme and hashtag “Lucky to be,” are McCann Always On, part of the McCann Erickson New York unit of Interpublic, and Street Factory Media in Minneapolis. “We feel Lucky Charms is a brand of ‘magical possibilities’ for everyone and anyone,” said Greg Pearson, marketing manager for Lucky Charms at General Mills in Golden Valley, Minn., partly because each box contains three kinds of pieces shaped like rainbows, “one of the universal symbols of acceptance.” So far, almost all comments about “Lucky to be” have been “really positive,” Mr. Pearson said, without the kind of reaction suffered by a commercial with an interracial cast for another General Mills cereal, Cheerios. That drew so many vituperative remarks on YouTube that the commenting function was disabled. There are many complaints, along with more than 15,500 “likes,” on the Facebook fan page for Grey Poupon mustard, sold by Kraft Foods, regarding an L.G.B.T. ad posted on Monday depicting two men from a revived version of the brand’s signature car commercial holding hands. The negative remarks include “gross,” “sick” and “you just lost another buyer.” The ad was created by Crispin Porter & Bogusky, part of MDC Partners. For Expedia’s commercial, the response has been “mixed,” Ms. Gavin said. “There are a lot of folks who applaud us and a lot of folks who aren’t happy.” That will not deter Expedia, she added, because she believes that time is on the company’s side. “In 10 years,” she asked, “is this even a conversation we’ll have any more?” Mr. Wilke echoed Ms. Gavin. Marketers “are increasingly feeling comfortable about being inclusive,” he said. “This will continue to gather steam.”",

    "source": "Final All-Star Votes Are In, and Dodgers’ Puig Is Not <eos> Atlanta first baseman Freddie Freeman won the fan voting for the last spot on the National League All-Star roster, meaning the Los Angeles Dodgers sensation Yasiel Puig will not get to play in the July 16 game at Citi Field unless he is added as an injury replacement. Puig is off to a terrific start in the majors (hitting .394 with eight homers in 35 games heading into Thursday), but he has only been up for five weeks, leading some to question whether he belonged on the National League team. Freeman, who is batting .313 with nine homers, set a record with 19.7 million votes, and Puig was second. The league did not release the vote total for Puig. “I don’t have my head down at all,” Puig said through an interpreter. “I want to congratulate Freddie Freeman for winning the vote. I’m happy for everyone who voted. I have to keep playing. Hopefully, the best things come out for this team for the future.” In the American League, Toronto reliever Steve Delabar won with 9.6 million votes. He is 5-1 with a 1.74 earned run average in 37 appearances for the Blue Jays. BRAVES 6, REDS 5 Freddie Freeman celebrated his newly won All-Star berth by driving in four runs with three hits as host Atlanta beat Mat Latos and Cincinnati. Freeman drove in two runs with a first-inning double and added run-scoring singles in the second and fourth innings. Latos (8-3) lasted only four innings in his shortest start of the season. PHILLIES 3, NATIONALS 1 Kyle Kendrick outpitched the All-Star Jordan Zimmermann, and pinch-hitter Kevin Frandsen hit a tiebreaking double in the seventh for host Philadelphia. Image Yasiel Puig was hitting .394 with eight homers in 35 games heading into Thursday, but he was second in the fan voting for the last spot on the National League All-Star roster. Credit Christian Petersen/Getty Images Jonathan Papelbon finished for his 20th save in 24 tries. Papelbon blew two saves against the Nationals last month and allowed two runs in a 3-2 win Monday night. CUBS 3, CARDINALS 0 Edwin Jackson earned his third straight win, combining with four relievers on a four-hitter, and Anthony Rizzo drove in all the runs to lead host Chicago. St. Louis had the tying run at the plate in the ninth inning after, but Alfonso Soriano made a shoestring catch on Jon Jay’s liner to end the game. RAYS 4, TWINS 3 Matt Moore, a recent addition to the A.L. All-Star team, won his 13th game this season, Luke Scott and Evan Longoria hit back-to-back homers and the surging Rays completed a four-game sweep by beating visiting Minnesota. Moore (13-3) gave up three runs, three hits and two walks and had 10 strikeouts over seven and a third innings. Moore is taking the spot of the Texas right-hander Yu Darvish, who went on the disabled list this week because of a strained trapezius muscle. RED SOX 8, MARINERS 7 Daniel Nava hit a two-out single in the top of the 10th to score pinch-runner Jackie Bradley Jr., and visiting Boston rallied from a 5-1 deficit. ORIOLES 3, RANGERS 1 Chris Davis hit his major-league-leading 34th homer to back a strong pitching performance by Miguel Gonzalez as host Baltimore earned a split in its four-game series with Texas. Davis’s 34 home runs are the most in the majors before the All-Star break since 2001. WHITE SOX 6, TIGERS 3 A sixth-inning grand slam by Joshua Phegley gave Chris Sale some long-awaited offensive support, and visiting Chicago went on to beat Detroit in a game that included a bench-clearing altercation shortly after the White Sox took the lead. INDIANS 4, BLUE JAYS 2 Toronto was held to two hits by the rookie Danny Salazar, who was making his big-league debut for host Cleveland. Salazar pitched six superb innings — he held Toronto without a hit for the first five — and overpowered the Blue Jays, who struggled to catch up to a fastball that registered 99 miles per hour on the stadium radar gun.",

    "source": "Health Officials to Propose Tighter Monitoring of Water Tanks <eos> In a reversal, New York City health officials are proposing stronger oversight of rooftop water tanks, which supply drinking water to millions of residents and workers each day but are often neglected by their owners. The city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is proposing to change the health code to require building owners to submit records of annual tank inspections to the city. Currently, the owners, who are responsible for cleaning, inspecting and testing water tanks once a year, are required only to keep their records for five years and make them available upon request. The inspection records are the primary indication health officials have of the cleanliness of a water tank and the drinking water inside. The move follows an investigation by The New York Times that found that regulations governing water tanks were rarely enforced and that some tanks contained E. coli, a bacterium, found in feces, that is used to predict the presence of viruses, bacteria and parasites that can cause disease. The presence of E. coli suggested that animals had gotten into the tanks, experts said. Building superintendents interviewed by The Times reported finding dead birds and mice in their tanks, and one said a person had been sleeping in the space between the tank cover and the roof. “This is a civilized city in a first-world country,” Corey Johnson , a City Council member of Manhattan, said. “People should not be drinking water that has feces or bones or anything else in the water. It’s unacceptable.” Recent surveys by the health department showed that nearly 60 percent of landlords did not comply with existing rules. Health officials, who previously insisted that they were satisfied with their current oversight, indicate in their proposal that the changes will “promote building owner compliance with the inspection mandate and facilitate the department’s ability to monitor compliance.” The health department will hold a public hearing on the proposed changes on Monday and the Board of Health is expected to vote on the proposal on June 9. New York City’s water flows from upstate reservoirs through hundreds of miles of tunnels into city mains and arrives with only enough pressure to supply water up to the sixth floor of most buildings. Since the late 1800s, owners of taller buildings have employed pumps in the basement to carry water up to a wooden tank on the roof. Water enters the tank through a spout at the top, and when drinkers or bathers open their taps below, water exits the tank through a pipe midway down. Gravity does the rest. Image Rooftop water tanks in Manhattan. Owners are required to inspect them once a year, but the city is considering stricter rules. Credit Kirsten Luce for The New York Times From 12,000 to 17,000 water tanks crown city structures today as part of a delivery system that has barely changed in a century. Even today, new water tanks are usually built from yellow cedar. City health officials reject the idea that the tanks pose any health hazard. “Though there is no evidence that drinking water tanks pose a meaningful risk to public health, we are proposing these additional actions to help reassure New Yorker’s that the city’s drinking water is safe and encourage greater compliance with the Health Code,” the health department said in a statement. Daniel Kass, a deputy health commissioner who is in charge of water tank oversight, wrote a letter to the editor criticizing The Times’s investigation the day after it was published. He characterized the city’s water testing program as “vigorous” and said that of “the 534 samples the Health Department has collected at buildings over seven stories high since 1985, not a single one tested positive for E. coli.” But Daniel R. Garodnick , a City Council member from Manhattan, said: “Five hundred and thirty-four samples in 30 years? That’s a drop in the bucket. A few hundred inspections in over three decades probably won’t calm many nerves.” Approval of the proposal by the Board of Health is not assured. At a board meeting in March, some members expressed hesitation about even publishing the proposed regulation and soliciting public comment, given that the department had no data showing that drinking water was unsafe. One member, Bruce C. Vladeck, suggested that rather than strengthening the reporting requirement, the department should consider cutting back inspections from once a year to once every five years. Mr. Vladeck said the regulations added to the cost of housing. In his building, he said, that could save up to “$20,000 every year for the plumber.” In contrast, Mr. Garodnick’s office is working on legislation that would go even further than the health department’s proposal, requiring the health department to report landlord compliance rates to the Council annually and to create a searchable online database for water tank inspection reports. The public advocate’s office is drafting a bill to require more thorough reports from landlords, random water tank field inspections by health officials, and detailed notices of inspection results posted for residents. “We’re trying to keep it clean and safe for New Yorkers,” the public advocate, Letitia James , said. “The only way to ensure that is to shed some light on the system.” Both the Building Owners and Managers Association of New York and the Real Estate Board of New York said they supported the city health officials’ proposed changes to the code, noting the importance of keeping tenants safe and the ease of satisfying the new requirement. “Buildings are required to conduct the inspections, so submitting the paperwork will not be difficult,” a board representative said. But another landlord advocacy group, the Rent Stabilization Association, is concerned that the health department’s proposal could leave landlords vulnerable to lawsuits. “At first blush, it sounds like something to give ammunition to sue an owner,” said Frank Ricci, the group’s government affairs director. “A tenant can get sick in a building and it may or may not be from the water supply. But now, when you have this thing on file with the health department saying that you should have filed in January, but you waited until June? Someone’s going to use that for litigation purposes.”",

    "source": "Teller Ponders an Enigma: Making the Mind Jump Through Hoops <eos> I had just put another spoonful of succulent sweet potatoes, slow-simmered with apples and pecans, onto my plate. “I’ve been invited,” I said to the guests at the holiday dinner, “to write about puzzles.” (My memory of this dialogue may be blurred by carbohydrates .) “But I’ve never found puzzles attractive,” I went on. “Why would you deliberately expose yourself to stress and frustration? You put in effort that you could have used to write a novel or cure cancer , and you come out with nothing but the solution to a previously solved problem. What’s the point? Why torment yourself?” At one end of the table sat our historian. “I love being overwhelmed,” he said, his deep-set eyes burning over his high cheekbones. “When I was a boy, I used to take seven or eight jigsaw puzzles, pour all the pieces together on a table and mix them up. Then I’d sort them by color into their respective boxes and solve them all individually. If I hadn’t done that, and learned that you can solve overwhelming problems by breaking them down, organizing them, I don’t think I could write history.” I thought for a moment. “So it’s like lifting weights in the gym? You’re not actually doing useful work, but you’re strengthening particular muscles.” At the other end of the table sat a square-jawed personal trainer from Iowa. “When I’m taking people through a workout,” he said, “I make them break down the lifting movements in their heads, like his puzzle. If you identify which muscles need to fire” — he illustrated with a turkey leg — “your workouts are efficient, and you get stronger faster.” Across the table my pretty blond stage manager seemed lost in thought. I asked her, “Do you do puzzles?” “I do,” she said. “I like the crosswords because I can call Mom up and we can work them together over the phone. She’ll ask, ‘What’s a four-letter word for knife?’ And I’ll answer, ‘Snee,’ and she’ll be so happy.” “It builds your vocabulary,” said the historian. “You learn words like ‘ort.’ ” “When my father was in his 80s,” I recalled, “every day year-round, he’d walk two blocks to the newspaper box, bring home the paper, make a cup of instant coffee and do the Jumble at the kitchen table. One January he got snowed in. I faxed him his puzzle. He liked that. But later when I sent him a book of Jumbles, he put it away with distaste. ‘I don’t want a bunch of them. I do my one puzzle a day — and then it’s out of the way.’ ” “Just lately,” said my stage manager, “I’ve been trying those English cryptic crosswords online, but I don’t get them yet. They’ll say, ‘Arrange lease for the artist,’ and somehow you’re supposed to figure out ‘arrange’ means that ‘lease’ is an anagram of something and it’s ‘for the artist,’ so it’s an easel.” “Oooof!” grunted the aspiring 29-year-old horror filmmaker, looking as though he’d been smacked in the face. “Sorry. I wasn’t reacting to what she said,” he said. He pointed to his plate. “In this cranberry sauce there was one cranberry that hadn’t burst.” He winced. “It was the sourest thing I ever ate in my life,” he said with masochistic glee. “You love anything painful,” I said. “So do you. You invent magic tricks that drive people crazy and scare them to death. You frustrate the hell out of them. But they buy tickets, don’t they? That’s just as nuts as doing puzzles.” “Pain,” our historian said softly, “when it comes by choice — whether in a jigsaw, a workout, a crossword, a magic trick or a too-tart fruit — can be pleasure.” I took that as my cue to serve the pie. At Halloween the pumpkin had been cut, stewed, mashed and frozen. Earlier today, the pale squash had been thawed and sweetened and beaten into the eggs, then cradled in flaky dough, baked to the most delicate of custards and cooled. Then at table, each slice was topped with fresh, unsweetened whipped cream. The guests went silent at the first bite. There were deep, slow sighs such as I imagine would be heard in an opium den. It was the perfect balm to the pain of the cranberry.",

    "source": "Personal Triumph for Thad Matta, but a Trying Year for Ohio State <eos> COLUMBUS, Ohio — Thad Matta, who had just secured the most victories in Ohio State men’s basketball history, was celebrated at halfcourt inside Chicago’s United Center after a flawed but gutsy victory against Minnesota in the Big Ten tournament Thursday. Matta was handed a pristine white No. 298 jersey. It was an appropriate token for his 298th win, which has forever sewn him into program lore. He beamed and posed for pictures with his team, his wife, Barbara, and their daughters, Ali and Emily. Yet in the preceding two weeks, Matta had deflected questions from the news media about the inevitably of the feat with jokes and a brand of sarcastic stoicism that has become familiar in his 11 seasons in Columbus. Highs and lows are often met with humor and self-deprecation. “Honestly, I haven’t thought about it,” Matta said with a thin smile. “I think if it happens, then I may take a deep breath and say, ‘Hey, let me think about what it really means to me.’ ” At a place like Ohio State, where coaches and athletes are lionized, Matta has been careful in what he is willing to reveal to strangers. “He’s perfectly fine with coming to the gym, getting work done, going home and nothing in between,” said Aaron Craft, a former Ohio State star point guard. “When he has to, he can turn it on. But he’s never a guy that’s going to go out and seek that kind of attention and seek that kind of glory for himself.” Archie Miller, who studied under Matta for two seasons in Columbus before taking the helm at Dayton in 2011, agreed. “He wants to go about his business,” Miller said. “He wants do it in a way where he doesn’t have to be the center of attention.” An N.C.A.A. Bracket for Risk-Takers For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct. On the night of a milestone, though — one achieved by overcoming back problems that have rendered him unable to easily walk, sit or dress himself — Matta was grateful and introspective. “The people it probably means the most for me is my wife and my two daughters,” he told reporters at a postgame news conference. “Because I’ve gone probably — well, going on eight years — with a disability. And they’re the ones that have suffered the things that I can’t do as a father — I can’t do as a husband.” In 2007, Matta, who has had back problems most of his life, was left partially disabled after emergency surgery to alleviate extreme pain. His right foot no longer works properly, and he wears a brace to prevent him from falling. His back still hurts, and it has seemed to grow worse this season. He sits on a high stool during news conferences, and he is increasingly tethered to a high chair next to the team’s bench. “I have some really, really bad days in terms of coming home after games, and they’ve got to help me get my shoes and socks off,” Matta said. “And for them to stay the course with me, it means a heck of a lot more to me for them than it does for myself.” Matta has won five Big Ten championships and four conference tournament titles and has taken his club to the N.C.A.A. tournament in eight of the last nine seasons. He led Ohio State to its first title-game appearance since the 1960s in 2007, the Final Four in 2012, the round of 8 a year later, and the round of 16 in 2010 and 2011. This season has been trying, however. One day after the team honored Matta, the Buckeyes fell to Michigan State in the Big Ten quarterfinals; it was the program’s worst showing since 2008. Ohio State (23-10) — which earned a No. 10 seed in the N.C.A.A. tournament and will play Virginia Commonwealth on Thursday — trailed by as many as 17 points less than a week after a 24-point loss to Wisconsin at home that could be considered the nadir of the team’s inconsistent season. Because of this, Matta’s personal triumph is mixed with unrest from corners of the team’s rabid fan base. “The first two comments on my game story the other night were from people that, the first one said that Matta needs to be fired and the second one agreed with him,” said Bob Baptist, who has covered Ohio State basketball for The Columbus Dispatch since 1997. “This is the night after he set the record for wins, which I thought was pretty interesting. It’s sort of illustrative of the short-attention-span fan right now.” Baptist said the program was at a crossroads with a group of underwhelming veteran players and an influx of new talent like D’Angelo Russell, the star freshman guard who is expected to be a top pick in the N.B.A. draft if he chooses to leave Ohio State. “It’s either this is one bad senior class that he’s had or the other argument is that the current staff that he has and Thad himself are not developing players well enough,” he said. “I don’t think right now there’s an answer for it. But if this continues, I think he could be in trouble.” Baptist said Matta was firmly backed by Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith and the administration “not only for as many games as he’s won, but for the type of person he is.” Alan Major, the former coach at Charlotte, who teamed with Matta for eight seasons as an assistant at Xavier and Ohio State from 2001 to 2010, knows Matta’s personality well. “He’s just got this kind of next-door-neighbor, blue-collar, guy-you’d-love-to-sit-on-the-front-porch-with-and-have-an-iced-tea mentality,” Major said. Even so, a disgruntled minority of fans has grown louder in recent months. Expectations are soaring here, especially after the football team won the inaugural College Football Playoff. An early exit in last year’s N.C.A.A. tournament did not help. Earlier this month in a teleconference, Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo compared Matta to Lloyd Carr, the former Michigan football coach, saying, “I think he does an incredible job, and I’ve gained so much respect for him over the years, and yet he doesn’t seem to please enough people sometimes in Columbus.” But those who know Matta best paint him as an optimist whose back struggles have led to relentless hope on the court. It is a notion apparent in interviews with his players, who maintain their goal of returning to the Final Four despite their struggles. Such outlooks might begin with how Matta embraces his pain. “You would never be able to tell unless he told you about it,” said Brad Stevens, the Boston Celtics’ coach, who began his foray into basketball under Matta at Butler in 2000. “Or excuse me, unless you asked him about it, because he’s not going to say anything.” Matta and the Buckeyes remain dreamers in a season in which they have been doubted — even by those within their passionate fan base. “The beauty of Thad is he does it and coaches for the right people and for the right reasons,” Major said. “I know he doesn’t let those things get to him. He knows who matters, and that’s the best part about him.”",

Scola, a Houston Rockets forward, scored 17 of Argentina’s 23 points in the first quarter as the South Americans built a 3-point lead against Angola (1-2). He finished the half with 21 points as Argentina (3-0) led by 45-32 at the break. Argentina led by only 5 points after three quarters, but Carlos Delfino and Scola then took over to secure the victory. Delfino, who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, finished with 22 points. COLD SHOOTING FELLS GERMANY Patty Mills scored 16 points as Australia cruised past cold-shooting Germany, 78-43, in a Group A game in Kayseri. A day after upsetting Serbia in two overtimes, Germany fell behind by 12-2. The lead reached 22 before Australia (2-1) took a 38-20 lead into halftime. Germany shot 26 percent from the field. Jan Jagla, who had 22 points against Serbia and hit a decisive off-balance 3-pointer, scored 2 points and did not play in the second half. SERBS BOUNCE BACK Dusko Savanovic and Marko Keselj scored 21 points each as Serbia rebounded from its loss to Germany by beating Jordan, 112-69, in Group A play in Kayseri. Serbia (2-1) used its height to dominate Jordan (0-3) inside. Center Nenad Krstic sat out the last of his three-game suspension for a pretournament brawl, but his backup, Kosta Perovic, scored 20 points. SLOVENIA HOLDS OFF CROATIA Uros Slokar and Jaka Lakovic scored 15 points each, and Slovenia beat Croatia, 91-84, in a Group B game in Istanbul. Slovenia (2-1) took the lead for good on Miha Zupan’s 3-pointer with 6 minutes 33 seconds left. Samo Udrih followed with a layup and Lakovic sank a 3-pointer, making it 77-71, and the Slovenians never let Croatia (1-2) get closer than 4 points from there. Croatia made only 15 of 26 free throws. FIRST WIN FOR IRAN Iran earned its first victory at its first world championships, blowing most of a 24-point lead before defeating Tunisia, 71-58, in a Group B game in Istanbul. Hamed Haddadi of the Memphis Grizzlies had 23 points and 13 rebounds for Iran (1-2), whose lead was down to 3 in the final minutes before it pulled away from Tunisia (0-3). EXPANDED DRUG TESTING FIBA, basketball’s governing body, said that more than 100 random drug tests would be conducted at the world championships, its largest program since beginning random drug testing in 1990. Patrick Baumann, FIBA’s secretary general, said that 48 players, two from each team, had been tested and that there would be at least 60 more tests. He said he hoped this could “banish the myth that some teams are not tested.”",

    "source": "E.U. Finance Chiefs Near a Deal on Budget Sanctions <eos> BRUSSELS — European Union finance chiefs appeared close to a deal on Monday to sanction countries that spend beyond their means — and, in so doing, threaten the stability of the euro — but it remained unclear how long governments would have to adjust their budgets before the measures would be imposed. Germany and the European Commission have called for nearly automatic penalties against countries that breached debt and deficit limits. Ministers still were discussing late Monday whether to compromise on that point at a time when governments across Europe were struggling to push through austerity budgets, or to maintain a commitment to a rapid system. With several countries facing strong public resistance to efforts to reduce deficits and trim debt, “a lot of member states are getting cold feet now” about making sanctions automatic, the Dutch finance minister, Jan Kees de Jager, said. Late Monday, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France said after a meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that there should be sanctions on member states that failed to take measures to reduce their budget deficits within six months, Reuters reported from the French town of Deauville. Under a possible compromise, European governments still would have a last chance to repair their budgets before any sanctions kicked in, according to a copy of the draft conclusions obtained by Bloomberg News. But Reuters reported late on Monday that governments were nearing agreement on almost automatic sanctions, even as they discussed how soon they should kick in. The recommendations by the so-called E.U. task force on economic governance are expected to be presented at a meeting of national leaders on Oct. 28 and 29 in Brussels. The task force is chaired by the European Union president, Herman Van Rompuy. Olli Rehn, the E.U. commissioner for monetary affairs, said the meeting Monday, which was held in Luxembourg, was “the moment of truth for E.U. member states, whether they are genuinely for reinforced economic governance or not.” But it is still unclear whether investors, whose skepticism about the solidity of some countries’ finances has driven up borrowing costs, will be satisfied. Some financial analysts sounded the alarm Monday at earlier reports of the compromise. Easing the timing of sanctions “would represent a remarkable concession at this juncture” by Germany that was “attributable to a lack of support on the part of euro-area member states” for tougher measures, Thorsten Polleit of Barclays Capital wrote in a research note. In reality, doubts about the ability of the European Union to enforce budget limits may well have persisted anyway. An existing budget treaty called the Stability and Growth Pact already requires E.U. members to keep their public deficits under 3 percent of gross domestic product and public debt at no more than 60 percent of G.D.P. Many European countries have deficits that exceed those limits. But the sanctions in that pact — like stiff fines — have never been imposed because of a lack of political will. France insisted Monday that the compromise represented progress. “Look at the whole picture: it’s a massive strengthening of the pact,” the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said, according to Bloomberg News, apparently referring to the earlier pact. France is facing protests, demonstrations and possible shortages as it tries to push through fiscal changes, including raising the retirement age. Strikes linked to austerity programs also have rattled Spain and Greece, which triggered the euro crisis this past spring when the true scale of its debt became known. The story is different for Germany, the biggest contributor to financial support for Greece and to a stabilization fund for the euro worth €750 billion. The German public has sought assurances that the Greek situation can never happen again. The European Commission, supported by Germany, has been calling for measures to increase the likelihood that the European Union would impose sanctions. These would include a so-called reverse voting mechanism, whereby governments would have had to vote to stop the imposition of sanctions, rather than vote in favor of sanctions.",

    "source": "Mine Safety Nominee Fields Tough Questions From Senators <eos> WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 - The Bush administration's nominee to be the nation's top mine safety regulator faced tough questioning on Tuesday at a Senate confirmation hearing that reflected competing visions of a proper oversight role. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, suggested that the nominee, Richard M. Stickler, might be too cozy with the mine industry to move the Mine Safety and Health Administration, which he would head, toward stiffer enforcement. \"Mr. Stickler's history is long on coal production experience but short on ensuring worker safety,\" said Mr. Kennedy, referring to the nominee's three decades of management experience in the industry. The senator added that an aggressive leader was needed to prevent tragedies like the two accidents that killed 14 miners in West Virginia in January, and said, \"I'm concerned that Mr. Stickler may not be that person.\" But Mr. Stickler, who worked for BethEnergy Mines of Amity, Pa., for 30 years before heading the Pennsylvania Bureau of Deep Mine Safety from 1997 to 2003, said, \"I believe I have the background and experience to do this job.\" \"I have been an underground miner,\" he said, adding, \"I know what it feels like to lose men in tragic mine accidents.\" The committee chairman, Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, endorsed the administration's preference that oversight agencies work in partnership with industry rather than act as taskmaster. \"We need to realize that workplace safety is a team effort,\" Mr. Enzi said. \"There are no adversaries in the effort to promote workplace safety.\" But Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, pressed Mr. Stickler on whether he would be willing to push the agency, which has been criticized as lax in enforcing its own regulations, to play a tougher role. \"Are you going to move forward in an aggressive direction,\" Ms. Murray asked, \"or are we going to hear more of the voluntary philosophy of they will do the right thing if we just sit back and let them?\" Mr. Stickler said he planned to study the regulations and make whatever changes he could. \"But generally I think the current laws are adequate,\" he added. Mr. Enzi disagreed with the view that the mine safety agency was headed in the wrong direction. \"Last year the total number of mine fatalities was the lowest ever recorded,\" he said. \"The injury rate in the mining industry was also the lowest on record. That tells me that the industry has made strides improving and promoting workplace safety.\" Indeed, another Republican, Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, said that since 2001, the annual number of coal mine fatalities per 1,000 mines had been cut nearly in half, to 11.1 from 19.6. Mr. Isakson also voiced confidence in Mr. Stickler's commitment to worker safety, citing his experience as an underground manager, superintendent and shift foreman. \"He is a man who, for most of his adult life, has wiped the coal dust off his boots every night,\" Mr. Isakson said. The committee has not yet set a date for a vote on Mr. Stickler's nomination. If confirmed by the full Senate, he will succeed David G. Dye, acting administrator of the mine safety agency, which has been without a permanent chief for a year.",

    "source": "School Built on Cemetery Provides Lesson in History <eos> TOLEDO, Spain — As this medieval hilltop city baked in the afternoon heat, a group of Jewish leaders gathered beside a freshly dug grave and lowered into it small bundles of flaking, ancient bones. With prayers and a plea for forgiveness for disturbing the peace of more than 100 medieval souls, they laid them to rest in the cool, reddish earth. The quiet ceremony in late June concluded months of delicate negotiations between Jewish groups and Spanish authorities over the fate of the remains of 103 Spanish Jews whose graves were excavated last year during the construction of a school building in a suburb of this historic city. The exhumation drew international condemnation from Jewish representatives and became an important battleground in the quest to preserve Jewish cemeteries all around Spain, remnants of a thriving community that made Toledo its capital before being expelled by Spain’s Roman Catholic monarchs in 1492. The dispute pitted the exigencies of modern society against the rights of a scattered people for whom a permanent tomb is a crucial religious requirement. It stirred friction between Jewish groups eager to protect their heritage but divided over how to deal with a secular government. “Toledo is central to Jewish history,” said David Stoleru, a co-founder of the Center of Studies Zakhor in Barcelona, a research group dedicated to preserving Jewish heritage. “The state has a duty to protect that legacy.” “This issue has international repercussions,” Mr. Stoleru said. “It’s not just affecting the Jewish community in Spain but the sensibility of an entire people.” The controversy began in September, when builders digging a new foundation at the Azarquiel High School discovered dozens of graves, believed to be part of a Jewish cemetery dating from around the 13th century. The cemetery may extend well beyond the grounds of the school; Mr. Stoleru said he recently saw bones in the ground at another nearby construction site. The government of Castilla-La Mancha, the parched region of which Toledo is the tourist-mobbed capital, halted the digging and stored the remains at a museum pending discussions with the Federation of Jewish Communities of Spain, which represents Spain’s 40,000 Jews. Jewish representatives suggested building a raised foundation to sit above the graves but were told this would be difficult and expensive, according to rabbis and government officials involved in the talks. María Soledad Herrero, who runs the regional government’s culture department, said the authorities had to balance the needs of history with those of students. “Nobody knows the importance of Spain’s Jewish heritage better than we in Toledo,” she said by telephone. “But we can’t put 1,000 pupils on the street.” As talks dragged on, the economic pressure grew, and in February the authorities ordered construction to restart. The facts on the ground built their own momentum: by mid-June, a foundation had been laid and the skeleton of a two-story building stood above the grave site. Meanwhile, international protests spread to New York , Israel and Canada. Rabbi David Niederman, president of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg , visited Spain to protest the exhumation, which he said was tantamount to a second expulsion. Thousands of black-clad Orthodox Jews gathered in a Brooklyn hotel in May to mourn the desecration. Finally, on June 18, the parties agreed to bury the remains close to the original graves but clear of the construction site. Dalia Levinsohn, secretary general of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Spain, hailed the agreement as the best solution available and dismissed criticism from groups that advocated a harder line. “We did what we could,” she said by telephone. “If you kick up a big fuss, the next time someone finds remains they won’t say a word to us.” However, Toledo’s symbolism made it an important, and distressing, precedent, preservationists and religious leaders said. “This is not an example we want to repeat,” said Rabbi Moshe Bendahan, Spain’s chief rabbi, who helped to broker the agreement. “The model would be to not excavate the remains in the first place.” Religious representatives in Toledo said the city should seize on a revival in interest in Spain’s Jewish past to promote understanding. The city, which is home to two of Spain’s last three medieval synagogues, but has virtually no practicing Jewish population, flaunts its history: its cobblestone streets are lined with shops selling swords, pottery and medieval figurines, and a small tram packed with tourists curls past its monuments. The regional government has shown a willingness to sacrifice modern construction for the sake of preserving historic sites: three years ago it stopped plans by a private developer to build 1,300 apartments in Toledo after diggers uncovered a Visigothic town. The 210-acre site is now protected and is set to be transformed into a museum and research center. Toledo is by no means the first city to face controversy over a Jewish burial site in Europe, where preservationists have battled exhumations from Prague to Vilnius, Lithuania. The remains of more than 150 people were exhumed from a medieval cemetery in Tarrega, in the Catalonia region, two years ago and reburied in a cemetery in Barcelona. Nor is the news all negative: in May, Catalonia’s regional government declared the Jewish cemetery on Mont Juic, in Barcelona, a cultural heritage site. Ms. Levinsohn said the federation would seek to sign protocols with Spain’s 17 regional governments to better safeguard Jewish cemeteries. Under Spanish law, when ancient human remains are found they are exhumed and stored for archaeological study. Jewish preservationists said Spain should also identify and map what Jewish leaders say they believe could be hundreds of unmarked cemeteries. For Mr. Stoleru, the issue of Jewish graves raises questions about how modern, secular Spain reconciles itself with dark chapters of its history, like the expulsion and forced conversion of thousands of Jews and Muslims during the Inquisition. “We need to reflect much more deeply about the expulsion and use history to inform our daily actions,” he said. “Jewish heritage in Spain should not be a museum piece. It should be a tool for teaching tolerance and diversity.”",

    "source": "To Enhance Scoring, N.H.L. Looks to Shrink the Goalie <eos> BUFFALO — At 6 feet 5 inches and 235 pounds, Buffalo Sabres goaltender Robin Lehner is big even by N.H.L. standards, able to block much of the net by using his bulk. Yet he has noticed during the past several seasons that his counterparts tend to eclipse the net, too. “I know what all the goalies around the league look like with their pads on,” Lehner said. “Some of the small guys look the biggest.” The reason: supersize and layered equipment. “A guy that’s 175 shouldn’t have a chest protector where he looks like he’s a 350-pound guy,” Lehner said. “I don’t think anyone should have pants underneath their pants. There’s goalies that have pants underneath their pants. That’s a fact. People in the league know it.” Last year, the N.F.L. endured scandal with accusations that the New England Patriots had deflated footballs to gain an advantage. In the N.H.L., complaints center on goalies’ inflating their profiles to better stop pucks. The N.H.L. and the players’ union are in the process of overhauling standards governing the size and design of goaltenders’ equipment. They plan to roll out slimmer-fitting pants and chest protectors and beefed-up enforcement during the coming season, which begins next Wednesday. “It’s basically, we want to have fairness that your gear shouldn’t make you a better player, giving you an advantage over your athleticism,” said Mathieu Schneider, special assistant to the executive director of the players’ union. “The idea is that it creates more goal scoring as well.” Image The Islanders’ Jaroslav Halak, at 5-11, is expected to be the only No. 1 goaltender on an N.H.L. team this season who is shorter than 6 feet. Credit Seth Wenig/Associated Press Despite an increased emphasis on calling obstruction penalties to open up the game, scoring has remained flat, and the league and the players’ union continue to tinker with rules. In the meantime, goaltenders continue to get bigger and better at stopping the puck. Ben Bishop of the Tampa Bay Lightning is 6 feet 7. The only expected No. 1 goaltender on an N.H.L. club who is shorter than 6 feet is Jaroslav Halak of the Islanders, who is 5-11. During the past 10 seasons, only one goalie under 6 feet — 5-11 Tim Thomas, with the Boston Bruins in 2008-9 and 2010-11 — has won the Vezina Trophy, awarded to the N.H.L.’s top goaltender. “If he’s not 6-foot-1, 6-foot-2, in the draft, you don’t even look at him unless he’s really special,” said Martin Brodeur, assistant general manager for the St. Louis Blues. Brodeur, who is 6-2, retired in 2015 as the N.H.L.’s career leader in wins (691) and shutouts (125). During his career, he was involved with the players’ union’s effort to reduce the width of pads to a maximum of 11 inches, from 12. “I’m sure goalies are tired of getting targeted all the time,” he said. “I couldn’t care less what guys wore. I felt more comfortable with smaller equipment, so everyone was always asking me questions about it. If I felt I could play with bigger equipment, trust me, I would have done it.” Three years ago, in the most recent changes to goalies’ gear, the coverage of the pads from the knee to the pelvis was reduced by 10 percent. But scoring did not rise. The average of goals per game has hovered just below 2.8 per team during the past six seasons, according to Hockey-Reference.com . In the meantime, save percentage increased to .915 over the past two seasons, from .914 in the 2013-14 season. Like Brodeur, some other goaltenders said they felt more agile and effective with diminished pads. “There’s a chance that happens with this,” Schneider said about slimmed-down gear. “When you look at the size and athleticism of guys today, at all positions but particularly in goal, these guys are incredible athletes. Gone are the days of the doughnut-eating, cigarette-smoking goalie.” The new pants will be more rounded and conform to a goalie’s body, Schneider said, in an attempt to reflect body proportions. Manufacturers have made prototypes, but only select goalies have seen them, including Halak, who helped Team Europe to a runner-up finish at the World Cup of Hockey in Toronto last week. “I tried them on, but I haven’t had a chance to try them in a practice yet,” he said. “Once we get back to our teams, there will be pants waiting for each of us over here, and we have to get used to them quickly. It’s not that big of a difference.” Schneider said the rollout for the new pants was still undetermined, but he was confident they could be implemented during the coming season. The design for a new chest protector has proved more challenging, with some goaltenders citing concerns that safety will be compromised by a streamlined design. Schneider said the first set of prototypes went out to select players in July, but it is unlikely they will be introduced this season. The pants and the chest protector were originally set to be ready by the start of the season. But Schneider said continuing feedback from goaltenders and delays with manufacturers had pushed back the timeline. Once the new equipment arrives, enforcement will be robust. “The first goalie that gets a suspension or a fine won’t be happy about it,” Schneider said, “but the idea is that we’re doing this and we’re not going to do it halfway.” Oversight will be handled at multiple levels, said Bill Daly, the N.H.L.’s deputy commissioner. “There’s a clearinghouse,” he said. “All of the pads and pants will be approved in advance by hockey operations. The only thing shipped to the clubs should be compliant equipment. Then there are spot checks by hockey operations during the course of the season. And the officials have the ability to police during games.” Lehner, who has not seen any of the new prototypes, said he looked forward to equipment that was more properly sized. “If I could go the same size ratio to my body as some of the smaller guys doing it, I would look huge,” he said. Whatever their personal dimensions or preference for equipment, goaltenders have agreed on one thing. When asked if they would prefer to alter their equipment or make the nets bigger, the response was unanimous, Schneider said with a chuckle: No one wanted to make the nets bigger.",

    "source": "A Custom Wardrobe Is Available Online <eos> A few weeks ago, FedEx dropped off an enormous box of clothes picked out for me by Carrie Harrison, my personal style consultant. Though we’ve never met in person, Ms. Harrison, a former clothing retailer who recently became a personal shopper, had somehow chosen several items perfectly suited to my tastes. There were many lovely shirts, an amazing pair of designer jeans and brown leather zip-up boots that will garner several compliments for my dazzling sense of fashion. I don’t deserve those compliments. As a writer who works at home, I prefer get-ups involving pajama pants, a sweatshirt and Crocs. I rarely go shopping for clothes, and when I do, I’m quick and robotic: if I find a pair of comfortable pants, I like to buy several in different colors to make them last for years. In other words, I’m a regular guy — if you don’t know someone like me, you probably are someone like me. That makes me the perfect customer for Trunk Club, an ingenious new online personal-shopping service that aims to turn schlubby fellows like me — or, say, your dad or your husband — into the sort of refined gentleman George Clooney might play in a movie. When you give Trunk Club as a gift, your style-challenged recipient is assigned a personal consultant. Using a webcam and Skype, he and the consultant will chat about his life and sense of style. Ms. Harrison asked me about my work, how often I have formal meetings, how often I go out for fun and whether my wife likes what I wear. (Usually, I think.) She also asked about my favorite colors, the weather where I live and how adventurous I tend to be in my fashion (I decided it was best not to tell her about my tuxedo T-shirt). Based on a meeting like this, Trunk Club sends your man a big box of clothes. He tries on everything while the consultant watches over Skype, offering advice on what works and what doesn’t. Trunk Club charges only for the clothes you keep; you send back the items that don’t suit you. There are no monthly membership fees, and the consultant’s time is gratis. Just as with Netflix, shipping both ways is free. The service can be close to revolutionary for men who aren’t fond of shopping for themselves, but who need nice clothes anyway — which Trunk Club is betting constitutes a large audience. “I should be careful not to make too broad a generalization, but I think most people would accept that women are more prone to enjoy shopping than men,” said Brian Spaly, the chief executive of Trunk Club. “Men are more likely to abhor shopping. They still want to look good, but they don’t enjoy the process.” You might also consider giving Trunk Club to a young man who’s just finished college and is looking for a new wardrobe. This gets to the magic of Trunk Club’s personalized service — it works for anyone, for virtually any situation. You tell the consultant what you need clothes for (a first job, a round of interviews on Wall Street, speed-dating night), and she’ll happily pick out a range of options. The service isn’t cheap. Trunk Club deals in upscale designer brands, and gift certificates come in denominations of $250 and above. The labels in my box included Jack Spade, AG, Perry Ellis, and Bed|Stu. (Don’t worry, I hadn’t heard of many of them, either). Shirts go for around $100, jeans for more than $150, and those shoes that I loved were $190. The prices are comparable to what you’d pay in a high-end department store, but I found the process much more enjoyable than going to the mall. For one thing, it’s luxurious to have someone else shop for you — there’s a sense of being pampered that is itself worth the cost of the gift. What’s more, if your recipient doesn’t have a very good eye for fashion, the clothes he’ll get through Trunk Club will probably trump the outfits he’d find if he braved the mall. Both my wife and my dinner companions praised a Trunk Club-provided shirt I wore out one night; I was candid about getting a consultant’s help, but other men can keep it a secret. The truly lazy man might find even Trunk Club too demanding. For him, there’s Manpacks.com , a sock and underwear subscription service. The company will send men a new pack of undergarments every three months; prices start at $11 a pack (including shipping) and can go up to more than $40, depending on the number and brands of socks, undershirts and underwear selected. Another service, Blacksocks.com , dismisses even that small bit of decision-making. Its “sockscription” will send you pairs of identical black socks every few months — the theory being that black socks go with everything, and they can never get mismatched. The price of a year’s subscription starts at $89 including shipping, for which you’ll get three deliveries of three pairs of socks. Both Manpacks and Blacksocks offer gift certificates. Then there’s ShirtsMyWay.com , which tries a different tack in getting men to dress better: total customizability. The site offers a sophisticated design tool that allows you to choose every aspect of your shirt, down to the color of the thread around the buttonholes. (There are more than seven trillion different fabric and style configurations, the company says.) Once you hit submit, your designs are whizzed off to ShirtsMyWay’s production center in China, where a tailor and team produce a shirt to exact specifications. Designing your own shirt sounds more difficult than picking one out at the store, but I found it to be much easier. That’s because you don’t have to hunt for your exact size — everything is tailored to your fit — and you can order several different colors in the same general style. The service also makes a perfect gift for fellows in hard-to-find sizes; for a big-and-tall or small-and-short guy who has trouble finding well-fitted shirts elsewhere, ShirtsMyWay may be a savior. Prices vary depending on the fabric, but I made a wonderful shirt for $125. And I didn’t have to leave the house to do it, either.",

    "source": "Berlin’s Over-Budget, Behind-Schedule Airport Becomes an Attraction <eos> BERLIN — In the early days of aviation, it was common for people to visit airports simply to stand on observation decks and watch the planes come and go. This city’s new airport is attracting tourists for the opposite reason: a conspicuous lack of passengers and planes after a series of delays and bungles that have driven its cost billions of dollars over budget and pushed its opening back indefinitely. Part of the appeal seems to be the chance to gawk at evidence that Germany — practically synonymous with precision and efficiency — could fail in such a spectacular fashion. Scheduled to open in November 2011, Berlin Brandenburg Willy Brandt Airport began offering public tours of the construction site after ground was broken in 2006. Since then, about one million people have signed up, said Ralf Kunkel, an airport spokesman. And business seems to have picked up even more as the problems have mounted. One budget travel agency began offering vacation packages last spring — two nights in a nearby hotel and a trip to the beleaguered airport in a double-decker tour bus. One recent Sunday afternoon, 16 sightseers and their guide, Elisa Naundorf, a lively young woman in tall black boots and a red-and-white parka, made their way to the airport’s Infotower, a 105-foot-tall triangular structure with an observation deck above and a museum and gift shop below. Before ascending the tower’s 171 steps, tourgoers could buy beach balls and baseball caps, umbrellas and USB sticks, all emblazoned with the airport logo. From one shelf, a plush blue ant wearing a miniature hard hat and overalls seemed to look on as visitors handed over $13.50 for the tour. History is an intrinsic part of Berlin’s backdrop, and more than a few sights here reflect its turbulent past. For some, the airport tour offered a refreshing change of scenery from the more weighty tributes to victims of Nazi persecution or monuments to the Red Army in the city’s central quarters. “I had seen enough memorials,” said Marlis Lippold, 48, of Osnabrück, in western Germany, who was spending the weekend in Berlin with friends. “I wanted to see why they’re still not finished out here.” From the lofty observation deck, one could see large tarps in the shape of X’s unfurled over an inactive runway, empty parking lots and four decommissioned jets, their engines wrapped in protective yellow covers, parked in front of a hangar. Amid the lack of progress, tourgoers learn, the airport’s builders and planners have sought ways to prevent the infrastructure from atrophying. Every weekday at 10:26 a.m., for instance, the railway company Deutsche Bahn sends empty subway trains through a tunnel leading out to the airport. The lonely journeys keep air in the tunnel moving so the tracks do not rust. It is anecdotes like this, often lampooned in the German news media, that have roused the curiosity of the many people eager to see how things are coming along, or how they are not. Germans are also curious to see how their tax money is being spent, after reports that the empty airport consumes more electricity each day than the city’s still-functional Tegel Airport , with its 400-plus flights a day, and that cleaning costs for the empty main terminal are $200,000 a month. “I was here a year ago, and I wanted to see if anything had changed,” said Felix Ritter, 20, a law student from Berlin. “It has been so mismanaged. What a waste of money.” The project may wind up costing upward of $5.8 billion — $1.6 billion more than originally planned — according to Mr. Kunkel, the airport spokesman. The joint ownership between the states of Berlin and Brandenburg and the federal government means that German taxpayers will foot the bill for any cost overruns. In a damage-control effort, Hartmut Mehdorn, the head of the company charged with building the airport, last year ordered that the construction site be tidied up. Fences were dismantled, and piles of building equipment were removed. Since then, at least superficially, the airport has given an impression of being ready for business. On the recent tour, participants wanted to know why the hundreds of problems delaying the opening — not the least of which is a defective fire safety system that courses through the entire building — had not been recognized sooner, and who was ultimately responsible for the mismanagement. The most pressing question, however, was about when the airport would finally open. While the airport is the largest construction project languishing in Germany, it is not the only major one. The Elbe Philharmonic Hall in Hamburg will be finished six years later than expected and cost about $700 million more, while the underground expansion of Stuttgart’s main train station is expected to be finished in 2021, 11 years late, and cost up to $2 billion extra. As the bus approached the main terminal along Melli-Beese-Ring, named after the first German woman to receive a pilot’s license, passengers whipped out their cellphones to snap pictures of the towering steel, glass and concrete structure. At 10,000 tons, the structure’s roof weighs about the same as the Eiffel Tower, according to Ms. Naundorf, the tour guide. Through the building’s glass facade, visitors could see check-in counters of polished nutwood and computer screens wrapped in plastic. Clusters of stanchions stood near orange construction cones. Bored-looking security guards in bright yellow vests watched the main entrance. The bus crept past the Steigenberger Hotel , opposite the airport’s main terminal, another victim of the delays. For months, cleaning crews have gone from room to room, turning on faucets and opening windows to keep the hotel fresh for when the first guest finally arrives. But when that will be remains unclear. The original 2011 target has been pushed back four times — the last time indefinitely — because of a number of budgetary and technical problems. Last year, the airport’s managers compiled a to-do list of hundreds of items that must be checked off before the airport can open. Mr. Mehdorn, the head of the building company, has said that although an official opening date remains uncertain, he hopes to be done with construction and any additional repairs by the end of this year. But tourgoers had their doubts. “I’m generally an optimistic person,” said Mr. Ritter, the law student, “just not when it comes to this airport.”",

    "source": "Stock Prices Slip Ahead of September Jobs Report <eos> Stocks edged lower Thursday, backing away from early gains, as uncertainty built up ahead of a crucial report on the labor market. The Dow Jones industrial average came within two points of 11,000 before turning lower for most of the day. The Dow hasn’t traded above that level since May 4, about a week after reaching its highest point of the year. Slightly better news on claims for unemployment insurance gave stocks an early lift, but the gains faded quickly as traders opted for caution ahead of Friday’s employment report from the Labor Department, the most crucial piece of news on this week’s economic calendar. Stocks are coming off a historically strong performance in September, and analysts say the market will need significant doses of positive news on the economy, corporate earnings or, preferably, both before heading decisively higher again. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 10.4 percent in September, but is still 2.1 percent below its 2010 high reached on April 26. In economic news, first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell last week, a better result than analysts were expecting. Retailers including Macy’s, Abercrombie & Fitch and Limited Brands reported better-than-expected monthly sales, which initially provided a lift to the market. The retail sales news was positive, but “there’s not enough to move the needle given that we’ve got the big jobs report” Friday, said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Investments. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.07 points, or 0.17 percent, to close at 10,948.58. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 1.91 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,158.06, while the Nasdaq composite rose 3.01 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,383.67. There is a wide range of expectations for how Friday’s jobs report might turn out, said Edward P. Crotty, chief investment officer at Davidson Investment Advisors. Even upbeat results might not be enough to drive stocks significantly higher. “If the number is good, there will be skepticism it’s not sustainable,” Mr. Crotty said. Claims for unemployment insurance have been falling steadily in recent weeks, but still indicate that employers are not ramping up hiring. The payroll company ADP said Wednesday that private employers trimmed jobs in September for the first time in seven months. Earnings reporting season got under way after the market closed Thursday when the aluminum maker Alcoa became the first company in the Dow Jones industrial average to report quarterly results. Alcoa’s net income fell 21 percent because of lower metals prices, but the results still beat analysts’ expectations. PepsiCo reported mixed results earlier in the day. The beverage and snack maker said its third-quarter profit jumped in part on revenue gains after its acquisition of its two largest bottlers earlier this year. Earnings matched expectations, but the company narrowed its earnings outlook to a level below analysts’ forecasts. PepsiCo fell $2.01, or 3 percent, to $66.10. Limited Brands shares rose $1.05, or 3.8 percent, to $28.64, while Abercrombie & Fitch jumped $3.44, or 8.9 percent, to $42.03. Macy’s rose 15 cents, to $23.85. Bond yields remained near their lowest levels since January 2009 as traders expected the Federal Reserve to step up its purchases of Treasury issues to lower interest rates and encourage borrowing. Cliff Draughn, president and chief investment officer at Excelsia Investment Advisors, said the Fed could act as early as its next meeting, which wraps up Nov. 3. The timing of the Fed re-entering the Treasury market hinges on how the investors react to election results on Nov 2. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 4/32, to 102 3/32, and the yield slipped to 2.38 percent from 2.40 percent late Wednesday. The mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said rates on traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages reached their lowest level on records dating back to 1971. The dollar continued to fall against other major currencies as traders expected interest rates in the United States to fall further. Currencies with higher interest rates become more attractive to foreign exchange traders when United States rates fall. Gold, which is considered a safe alternative to the dollar, hit another record of $1,366 an ounce early Thursday before pulling back to $1,333.55 an ounce.",

    "source": "Christie, Cuomo and Malloy Have Much in Common <eos> They’re not exactly a matched set, but when life as we know it resumes after the New Year, the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will have a lot in common. All will have backgrounds as prosecutors — Gov. Chris Christie as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, and the incoming governors of New York and Connecticut, Andrew M. Cuomo and Dannel P. Malloy , as a New York attorney general and an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, respectively. These days, a prosecutor’s ability to make a point clearly and sell it hard is no small skill. All three are considered high-energy, hard-charging types rather than amiable dealmakers or Clintonesque charmers. All three will encounter horrific fiscal challenges in high-tax states. All operate in largely Democratic states that have seen a governor forced to resign within the last seven years. All three follow predecessors who didn’t set the world on fire. All could be asked: Why would you want this job? The roads diverge from there, but how each fares could be an illuminating case study for governing in hard times. Mr. Christie, the only Republican among the three, is the best-known quantity, having actually had to serve as governor over the past year. So far, he’s enthusiastically embraced a model of governing as armed combat. That persona has made him a hot property in national Republican politics. The jury’s still out on how well it is working in New Jersey. The latest Quinnipiac University poll showed him with a 46 percent approval rating among New Jersey voters, compared with 44 percent disapproving. That’s down from 51-to-38 percent in November. Almost two-thirds said they would not vote for him as president. The most recent Rutgers-Eagleton poll showed him as perhaps the most polarizing governor in recent New Jersey history, with the second-highest “poor” rating for a first-year governor in the poll’s history and one of the highest ratings of “excellent.” Mr. Christie is facing a Democratic Legislature, but his relative success in driving against traffic offers lessons. The upside, said Prof. David P. Redlawsk, a Rutgers political scientist and director of its poll , is that Mr. Christie personifies the appeal of politicians with clear positions and beliefs, even if they’re not always popular. “People respect tough leadership in tough times,” he said, adding, “You’ve got to be able to say, ‘This is who I am and what I believe.’ ” The downside is that the politician as Terminator goes only so far. “Wielding a meat ax is something best done with finesse rather than bravado,” said Prof. Ross K. Baker, another Rutgers political scientist, adding, “There’s a point in which this kind of aggressive, chesty approach becomes bullying, and people don’t like that.” Finding the right balance might be a particular challenge for Mr. Cuomo, who has ruled out tax increases and campaigned on a Christie-esque assault on state government. He faces not just a nightmarish budget deficit, but also legislative dysfunction that makes New Jersey look like Switzerland. UNLIKE Mr. Christie, who occupies an extraordinarily strong governor’s office, Mr. Cuomo faces a divided Legislature and an Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who arguably is as powerful as he is. Like Mr. Malloy, Mr. Cuomo faces more complications than Mr. Christie does, in dealing with public employees’ unions that typically support Democrats. The good news: if Mr. Cuomo succeeds as a fiscal hawk, he will be a force nationally. The bad news: good luck on succeeding. By some measures, Connecticut’s budget deficit is the worst of the three. But given Door 1, 2 or 3, you might want Mr. Malloy’s. He has strong Democratic majorities in both houses and early praise for enterprising appointments, particularly persuading Justice Joette Katz to leave the Connecticut Supreme Court to head the troubled Department of Children and Families. As Barack Obama has learned, having the executive branch and the legislature run by the same party means that you own every failure. Still, after being elected despite some risky stances on subjects like tax increases (he says they’re on the table) and the death penalty (he’s against it), Mr. Malloy comes in with some straight-shooter credibility and without the bully label. And when being a governor is borderline impossible, a prudent person might try Connecticut over its neighbors. “I don’t think anyone would apply the slogan ‘Land of Steady Habits’ to either New Jersey or New York,” Professor Baker said.",

North Korea said Friday that it had already accounted for its nuclear arms program as required under a multilateral disarmament deal, but the assertion was rejected by the United States. “They were prepared to give a declaration which wasn’t going to be complete and correct,” said Washington’s top envoy to nuclear talks with North Korea, Christopher R. Hill, “and we felt that it was better for them to give us a complete one even if it’s going to be a late one. “So I think we have to have a little sense of patience and perseverance,” he told reporters in Tokyo after arriving for talks with Japanese officials. The United States and several allies have said North Korea missed a Dec. 31 deadline to submit a full inventory of its nuclear arms programs, as promised in six-party negotiations last year, and to disable its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon. At the talks — involving the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia — the North agreed to abandon its nuclear program for aid and a better international standing. “No one likes being late, but being late is probably preferable than being wrong or giving us something that we can’t work with,” said Mr. Hill, who will go to Seoul on Tuesday. “Some of the programs are ones that they would rather not discuss publicly,” Mr. Hill said when asked why, according to the United States, the North had not made a full declaration. “And I must say this is a society and a government whose first instinct is not to be transparent.”",

    "source": "Political Rally in Pakistan Ends in Deadly Stampede <eos> ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — At least seven people were killed and 43 injured in a stampede after a political rally for an opposition politician, Imran Khan , on Friday evening in central Pakistan , according to rescue workers and officials. The victims were suffocated as people pushed their way out of a gate at Qasim Bagh Stadium, where the rally was held, officials said. Hundreds of thousands of people had gathered in Multan, the biggest city in the southern part of Punjab Province, to listen to the speech of Mr. Khan, a charismatic former cricket player turned politician, who has been demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif . Mr. Khan has led sit-ins in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, since mid-August, and has now embarked on political rallies across the country to further expand his opposition movement. His political rallies are usually disciplined and organized, and attended by large numbers of young men and women. Friday’s event drew an estimated 80,000, according to local news reports. Image One of the dozens of people injured after the rally. At least seven people died as crowds pushed their way out of the stadium. Credit Asim Tanveer/Associated Press The disaster unfolded as people began to leave the stadium, witnesses said. “People tried to leave the venue at once,” one witness, who was not identified, told Geo TV, a private news network, “and 30 to 40 people fell down near Hussain Agahi Gate and were crushed by the incoming wave of people.” Television images showed people holding unconscious young men as they were rushed to a nearby hospital. Mr. Khan and his party leaders blamed the local government for the deaths, accusing it of mismanagement. “I hold the district administration of Multan responsible,” said Shah Mehmood Qureshi, a senior leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, the political party led by Mr. Khan. Mr. Qureshi claimed that district officials did not open all exits in the stadium and turned off electricity as people prepared to leave, setting off panic and confusion. But the government denied the allegations and laid the blame on the political party, claiming that it was responsible for the security of the event within the stadium. “Nobody from P.T.I. guided people about how to leave the venue,” said Zahid Saleem Gondal, the top government official of Multan, using the party’s initials. “This is an issue of internal security.”",

    "source": "Mayor de Blasio’s Days on the Road Fuel Criticism at Home <eos> A rally by the steps of the United States Capitol. Fire-up-the-base speeches in Iowa and Wisconsin. Cross-country political trips, paid for with private money, and a Silicon Valley fund-raiser hosted by tech moguls, with tickets going for up to $10,000 apiece. Clinton? Rubio? Bush? No. De Blasio. After 16 months as mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio seems determined to escape the confines of his day job and to prompt a national liberal movement — even as he leaves himself open to criticism that he is not making problems at home a priority. This week, Mayor de Blasio, a Democrat, is off to Washington to spend two days pressing federal lawmakers to shift their policies leftward. He flies from there to California, where he will speak about economic inequality and raise money for his national effort at a private reception in San Francisco, with the former president of Facebook, Sean Parker, as a co-host. By the time Mr. de Blasio returns, he will have been traveling outside New York on political trips for at least a portion of 10 of the last 31 days. (Throw in a vacation to Puerto Rico and college visits with his son, and the mayor has spent about a third of April and May on the road.) The mayor, who has steadfastly defended his trips, argued on Monday that his federal and municipal efforts were intertwined, and pointed to his efforts on housing, immigration and education as signs that he remains focused on the city. “Mayors before me have understood it the same way: They’ve had to speak to national issues, while making sure things work here every day,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference in Queens. “My job is to do both.” Still, Mr. de Blasio is pursuing his extracurricular activities at a notably early stage of his mayoralty. And at times, he has risked sounding like an outsider, evaluating his constituents from afar. “A lot of people outside New York City understand what happened in the first year of New York City better than people in New York City,” Mr. de Blasio said in a profile in Rolling Stone, referring to the first year of his administration. “But I’m convinced something very special happened here.” The remark prompted a cartoon in The Daily News that depicted the mayor with a giant balloon for a head, floating away from a puny body. “Caution,” the caption read. “Do not overinflate.” Advisers to Mr. de Blasio said his comment had been misinterpreted, saying the mayor wanted to draw a distinction between the preoccupations of New York City tabloids and what he viewed as his broader achievements, like starting a free prekindergarten program for 53,000 students, as well as a municipal identification card program. “He’s using every tool as mayor of New York City to combat the central issue of our times, which is income inequality,” said John Del Cecato, a political consultant who is helping to oversee Mr. de Blasio’s travels. “But he knows there is only so much that a mayor can do on his own,” Mr. Del Cecato added. “He really feels it’s an obligation to his constituents, to 8.4 million people, to help push the federal government to do its part.” When it comes to municipal matters, though, Mr. de Blasio has shown varying degrees of enthusiasm. In Queens on Monday, he announced a more stringent inspection regimen for the city’s troubled homeless shelters, denouncing an “unacceptable” status quo and adding, “I’m very proud of what is being done here.” Image Mr. de Blasio at a shelter in Queens on Monday, when he argued that his federal and municipal efforts were intertwined. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times But at a required lengthy city budget presentation last week, the mayor seemed less excited. After joking with reporters that driving to Las Vegas was “an appealing prospect as this press conference wears on,” he ended the event on an ironic note. “Thank you for sitting through this long and fascinating presentation,” the mayor said, dryly. Wanderlust among mayors is hardly new. Michael R. Bloomberg , a political independent, eagerly pursued a national profile while mayor, urging other cities to adopt his ban on smoking and leading a coalition to end gun trafficking; he also mulled a run for president, although those activities took place well after his first term. Mr. Bloomberg also traveled frequently to Bermuda . Rudolph W. Giuliani , a Republican, ran for the United States Senate toward the end of his tenure as mayor. John V. Lindsay , a Republican who later switched parties, campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination late in his second term. “You have to strap them to the mast, like Odysseus,” said Gordon J. Davis, a senior aide to Mr. Lindsay and former city parks commissioner. New York mayors, he added, can find the lure of fame “intoxicating.” But Mr. Davis, who was a speechwriter during Mr. Lindsay’s presidential bid, said he also believed the job required shining a spotlight on urban issues. “Is it the obligation of the mayor of the city of New York to be a spokesman on national issues? Absolutely, it is part of the job,” Mr. Davis said. “There may be some style issues on when you do it, and how you do it, but I think it’s perfectly appropriate.” Mr. de Blasio has denied any presidential ambitions — at least before his re-election fight in 2017 — but he is embracing the national spokesman role. Besides Rolling Stone, he gave an interview on MSNBC and wrote an op-ed article in The Washington Post with Senator Elizabeth Warren , Democrat of Massachusetts. Chirlane McCray , the mayor’s wife, is also courting a national audience, speaking with National Public Radio and publishing a Mother’s Day essay in Time magazine. Mr. de Blasio has been less forthcoming recently with his local press corps. Until the event on Monday, the mayor had allowed City Hall reporters to question him, without restrictions on the topic, three times in the last three weeks, including once after he bumped into reporters on the City Hall plaza. (Aides to the mayor said the shooting death of a police officer and the budget presentation last week took precedent.) In Washington this week, the mayor is scheduled to attend an event with Ms. Warren, before joining allies to unveil a list of federal policy demands, which he describes as the liberal equivalent of Newt Gingrich ’s “Contract With America.” In California, the mayor is speaking at his daughter’s university and appearing with Robert Reich, the former labor secretary. On Thursday in San Francisco, Mr. de Blasio is also set to attend a fund-raiser for the Campaign for One New York , a political nonprofit group established to advance his agenda. The group, which can accept large contributions outside New York City’s campaign finance limits, is paying for the mayor’s California trip. George Arzt, a longtime aide to former Mayor Edward I. Koch , a Democrat, recalled that Mr. Lindsay’s presidential ambitions were harmed when a Brooklyn Democrat urged the mayor to end his travels with the much-publicized comment, “Little Sheba better come home.” “It is extremely difficult being out of the city a significant number of days while telling city residents you are in charge,” Mr. Arzt said. He recalled that Mr. Koch, who ran for governor in his second term, rarely spent a night away from the mayoral residence, Gracie Mansion, for fear that something might go awry. Mr. Koch had a saying, Mr. Arzt recalled: “If a sparrow dies somewhere in the city of a heart attack, it is my fault.”",

    "source": "Federal Reserve Officials Openly Voice Deficit Concerns <eos> WASHINGTON — Wading deeply into fiscal policy is not normally the domain of the Federal Reserve , but several central bank officials have begun speaking out in forceful terms about the dangers of the expanding deficit. Though only a minority so far, the officials are warning that a failure to bring the budget under control could lead to a dangerous spiral of inflation. Worries about the possible long-term effects of the deficit have galvanized political debate in recent days, culminating in President Obama’s decision to create a bipartisan commission to tame the nation’s debt. The comments by Fed officials reflect, in part, a concern about the central bank’s ability to maintain its political independence over the long term, a concern shared by the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. Next week, Mr. Bernanke is set to deliver the Fed’s semiannual monetary report to Congress, and economists will be watching closely to see if he too says anything about the debt and the deficit. Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City since 1991 and the longest-serving of the 12 Fed bank presidents, warned on Tuesday that in the worst case, the Fed could face pressure to inflate the nation’s way out of its indebtedness. “It seems inevitable that a government turns to its central bank to bridge budget shortfalls, with the result being too-rapid money creation and eventually, not immediately, high inflation,” he said at a policy forum here, sponsored by the Peterson-Pew Commission on Budget Reform. “Such outcomes require either a cooperative central bank or an infringement on its independence.” Last Wednesday, the Dallas Fed president, Richard W. Fisher, said that interest rates on Treasury securities had been kept unnaturally low by the willingness of the Chinese to buy American debt and by shaky European economies, like Greece’s. “We cannot count forever on the largess or the misfortune of others to mask our own imbalances here at home — for fiscal profligacy in Washington today hinders our ability to address fiscal challenges tomorrow,” Mr. Fisher told the World Affairs Council of Dallas-Fort Worth. The Fed has just two main responsibilities — keeping inflation low and promoting maximum employment — but balancing them is perhaps its greatest challenge. With unemployment at 9.7 percent, few expect the Fed to start raising interest rates for at least several months. For now, Mr. Bernanke, who was granted a second four-year term last month after a contentious Senate debate, has shown little appetite for applying brakes on the economy, though he has outlined a strategy for the Fed to gradually reduce the size of its balance sheet, in part to reassure the markets that he is mindful of the threat of inflation. Mr. Hoenig was the sole dissenter last month when the Fed’s key policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, voted to keep short-term interest rates near zero, where they have been since December 2008. Specifically, Mr. Hoenig objected to the panel’s statement that “exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period” were still warranted. Mr. Hoenig is known for his wariness of inflation, so his dissent was not entirely a surprise. But other members of the committee, while using more cautious language, appear to share at least some of his concerns. In a speech last month in Arlington, Va., the Fed’s vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, said “the deficit is on track to remain quite large even as the economy recovers, pushing up the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product substantially.” Mr. Kohn added: “Unless the trajectory is changed, the competition for savings between the government, on the one hand, and households and businesses, on the other, could be significant as households and businesses begin to borrow and spend in the recovery, putting upward pressure on interest rates.” And James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, said in an interview last week that it made sense for the Fed to think about withdrawing from what he called its “unprecedented monetary policy” since 2008: the combination of near-zero interest rates and huge purchases of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities. The expansion of the balance sheet helped drive down long-term interest rates and support economic recovery. But Mr. Bullard said the idea that “the worst part of the crisis is over, so maybe it’s time to start adjusting” was sensible, adding, “I’m sympathetic to that argument.” Not all of the Fed’s leaders are preoccupied about the prospect of inflation; some consider it remote and are more focused on the weak job market. “I do think the news is mostly good on the inflation front, although the need for careful policy choices is even more critical than usual,” Narayana R. Kocherlakota said Tuesday in his first speech as president of the Minneapolis Fed. Mr. Kocherlakota told the Minnesota Bankers Association, in St. Paul, that the decline in gross domestic product during any recession was not felt evenly across the population. “Some workers — those who lose their jobs — suffer much bigger falls in income,” he said. “For this reason, many macroeconomists now believe that the true cost of a recession is not the fall in G.D.P. per se, but the associated increase in the risk of people becoming, and staying, unemployed.” Mr. Kocherlakota noted that employment was slow to recover after the last two recessions, in 1990-91 and in 2001, and that unemployment — still at its highest level since the early 1980s — has leveled off only because fewer employees are getting laid off or quitting. “To get a true expansion in employment and in the economy, the hiring rate has to pick up — and we have yet to see evidence that it will do so in the immediate future,” he said.",

    "source": "M.T.A. to Seek Higher Fares to Help Close Budget Gap <eos> The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will propose a substantial increase in transit fares and bridge and tunnel tolls next year to help close a widening budget gap of nearly $900 million, according to an official at the authority. Though the precise amount of the fare and toll increase has yet to be determined, the authority will seek to increase the revenue it gets from those sources by 8 percent. If approved by the authority’s board, the increase would take effect next July and would follow a toll and fare increase in March of this year. In the more than 100-year history of the subway, the fare has gone up in consecutive years only once before, in 1980 and 1981. On Wednesday, the authority will unveil a preliminary budget plan for 2009 that calls for the fare and toll increases and outlines other measures to balance its budget, including more than $300 million in additional financing that the authority hopes to get from the city and state. Coming at a time when the state and city budgets face extreme financial pressure as well, those requests are likely to be resisted by elected officials. The authority faces steadily rising costs, particularly for fuel, as well as sharply declining tax revenues due to a slowdown in the real estate market. Just six months ago, the authority predicted that its shortfall for 2009 would be slightly more than $200 million, less than a quarter of its latest projection. The budget plan, which the authority is required to produce in July, puts new focus on a state commission created by Gov. David A. Paterson to recommend long-term solutions for the authority’s chronic financial difficulties. The panel, which is headed by Richard Ravitch, a former authority chairman, is to make a report by November. The authority must pass a new budget for next year in December. Even traditional opponents of fare increases said they thought higher fares were inevitable because the authority’s financial problems are so deep, but they said riders should not have to bear the cost alone. “We’re not fans of fare hikes,” said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group, “but my view about the hikes will turn largely on how much the city and the state will pony up to pay their fair share.” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s chief spokesman, Stu Loeser, said in a statement that while the city recognized the authority’s financial problems, “City taxpayers aren’t in a position to increase our subsidy over the billion-dollars-plus we already provide each year.” He added, “That’s why we are looking forward to hearing the Ravitch commission’s findings about how the M.T.A. can find new revenue sources on both the expense and capital sides.” The authority official, who discussed the budget proposal on the condition of anonymity because it had not been made public, said the authority had not worked out details but expected the higher fare to bring in about $200 million. The authority is required by law to operate with a balanced budget. To achieve that, the new budget plan envisions an infusion of more than $300 million from the city and the state. Even with that additional aid, the authority will still need to raise fares and tolls and impose a variety of belt-tightening measures to close its budget gap. When the authority raised fares in March, it kept the base subway and bus fare unchanged, at $2, after having proposed to raise it to $2.25. It was not clear whether the base fare would rise next year, but the authority has said in the past that it prefers to make such increases in 25 cent increments, because its MetroCard vending machines are not set up to dispense coins smaller than quarters. Still, only a minority of subway and bus riders pay the base fare. Most use either unlimited-ride MetroCards or the pay-per-ride MetroCards that provide a 15 percent bonus on purchases of $7 or more. There are many ways the authority could increase overall subway and bus fare revenue by 8 percent — for example, through a combination of raising the base fare, lowering the pay-per-ride bonus and raising the cost of the unlimited-ride MetroCards, and the various fare types would not necessarily increase by the same percentage amount. The attempt to increase revenue by 8 percent would also apply to commuter rail tickets on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad and tolls on the authority’s bridges and tunnels, which include the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. There, too, different types of tickets and tolls, including E-ZPass and cash tolls, could have varying increases, as long as the overall revenues rise by 8 percent. The only other time that the subway fare has gone up two years in a row was in 1980 and 1981, when Mr. Ravitch was the authority’s chairman. He raised the fare in June 1980 to 60 cents from 50 cents. He raised it again in July 1981, to 75 cents. In a plan released a year ago, the authority proposed regular, modest fare and toll increases every two years. That pattern was supposed to begin with the fare that took effect in March, with the next increase scheduled for 2010. (The March increase was originally proposed at 6.5 percent, but it was reduced after Gov. Eliot Spitzer intervened.) Now, in calling for a fare increase next year, the authority is accelerating that schedule. The official who discussed the budget proposal said the authority had no choice, given its financial straits. Still, if the increase does take effect next July, the official pointed out, it would be ahead of schedule by only six months. The authority has run large surpluses in recent years, thanks to the region’s real estate boom, which provided soaring revenues from taxes on real estate transactions. The authority had expected those revenues to drop this year, but they have plummeted much further than anticipated. The surpluses were supposed to continue through this year, which the authority had predicted would end with $300 million in excess cash (largely because of real estate tax receipts left over from previous years). It now expects most or all of that surplus to be eaten up by higher than expected costs and lower than expected real estate tax revenues. Fuel costs are projected to be $88 million higher than anticipated this year, while real estate tax revenue is expected to be $201 million below the budgeted amount. The loss of the surplus is a major factor in the gloomy outlook for next year. As recently as February, the authority had predicted a 2009 budget deficit of slightly more than $200 million. But that figure has grown as the surplus dwindled. In addition, the authority expects that real estate tax receipts next year will be $242 million below previous forecasts, and it projects $123 million in added fuel costs for next year. The authority’s executive director, Elliot G. Sander, said in recent weeks that the authority faced a deficit as high as $700 million next year. The official who discussed the new budget proposal said the $700 million figure was in addition to the previously projected deficit of more than $200 million. Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Committee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions, said he had not taken a position yet on the agency’s proposal. But, he said, the agency will need “more city money, more state money and, unfortunately, more money from the users.” The budget calls for the city to greatly increase its subsidy of the Access-a-Ride program, which provides transportation to the disabled at an annual cost of more than $320 million. The city pays about $100 million a year now to subsidize the program. The authority’s new budget asks the city to contribute an additional $110 million. The authority will also seek to have the city and state pay for the total cost of giving city students free MetroCards. The city and state contribute $45 million each now for student MetroCards, but that covers only about half the cost. The authority wants the two entities to pay the entire cost, which would mean an addition of $90 million. The authority is also seeking to increase its revenues by ending a policy of giving free E-ZPass tags to city and state agencies for use in official vehicles.",

    "source": "U.S. Paid Residents Linked to Nazi Crimes $20 Million in Benefits, Report Says <eos> WASHINGTON — The American government paid $20.2 million in Social Security benefits to more than 130 United States residents linked to Nazi atrocities over the course of more than a half-century, with some of the payments made as recently as this year, according to a federal investigation. The millions of dollars paid out, a total far higher than officials had previously believed, indicate the ease with which thousands of former Nazis managed to settle into new lives in the United States with little scrutiny after the end of World War II . A report due to be released this week by the Social Security Administration ’s inspector general concludes that virtually all of the payments were proper under policies in place at the time, and that federal officials did not have the legal authority to prohibit benefits until a Nazi suspect was deported, according to officials briefed on the report. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the report has not yet been made public. In the 1960s and 1970s, as dozens of aging former Nazis in the United States were beginning to collect Social Security benefits, there was little investigation by federal authorities into possible links of immigrants to atrocities committed in wartime Germany. It was not until the early 1980s, under pressure from Congress, that the Justice Department began investigating hundreds of suspects in the United States and started deportation proceedings against former Nazi officers, concentration camp guards, execution-squad leaders and others. The report found that more than three dozen former Nazis received a total of $5.7 million in Social Security benefits before they were ultimately deported, the officials said. Another 95 suspected former Nazis who received a total of $14.5 million in Social Security benefits were never deported and continued receiving benefits. Some died before they could be deported, others fled the country and still others settled their investigations and were allowed to remain in the country. “It is outrageous that any Nazis were able to receive benefits, but this report also makes clear that the Social Security Administration lacked the legal right to terminate benefits in far too many of these cases,” said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, the New York Democrat who requested the investigation after new evidence emerged last year of Nazis receiving benefits. Reports first began surfacing in the 1980s that large numbers of suspected Nazis were receiving Social Security benefits after they had spent decades working in cities around the country, often in blue-collar jobs. An investigation by The Associated Press last fall drew renewed concern to the phenomenon, prompting Congress to pass legislation called the No Social Security for Nazis Act. That led to the termination of benefits to four Nazis who had left the United States to return to Europe. The most recent benefit payment came this January, investigators found. No other current or former United States residents linked to Nazi crimes are known to be receiving Social Security benefits today.",

The men, Michael Adams, 29, of the Bronx; his brother Stephen Adams, 27; and Zubearu Bettis, 44; entered the shop, BNC General Merchandise, on Amsterdam Avenue between 104th and 105th Streets, on June 18, with the intention of robbing the store, the police said. At the register, they encountered Bubacarr Camara, 26, a recent immigrant from Gambia, in West Africa, and one of them shot him in the head, investigators said. Mr. Camara was initially believed to have been bludgeoned to death. Stephen Adams and Mr. Bettis were arrested on June 26 in a separate robbery case in Manhattan and charged while in custody with Mr. Camara’s murder in Federal District Court. Michael Adams was arrested on Thursday after a tip, investigators said. All three men have been charged with second-degree murder and robbery. Mr. Bettis has a criminal record dating to 1991. Criminal records for Stephen and Michael Adams were not available. Mr. Camara, known as Buba, was a soccer star in his hometown, Numuyel, and spent time in the United States working to support his son, a toddler who remained with his mother in West Africa. In the store, which sells an array of items like iPhone cases and undershirts, he was known for frequently letting customers off the hook when they did not have the money for a fresh pair of socks, and for his devotion to Islam. The shop was closed a few minutes several times a day for Mr. Camara and his family to pray. Since the attack it has remained shut, its metal roll-down gate a memorial. Bangally Camara, Mr. Camara’s father, cannot bring himself to go back to the store, he said on Thursday. He plans to keep paying the rent until his lease is up, then close it for good. “If I could speak to them, I want to see why they killed my son, what is the reason they killed him,” the father said, his voice breaking. “You go rob somebody, you get what you got, so why did you kill him?”",

    "source": "Obama Gets 12 Stitches After Basketball Game <eos> WASHINGTON — President Obama had to get 12 stitches in his lip after getting a blow from an opponent’s elbow during a basketball game Friday morning, White House officials said. “After being inadvertently hit with an opposing player’s elbow in the lip while playing basketball with friends and family, the president received 12 stitches today administered by the White House medical unit,” the press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said in a statement. “They were done in the doctor’s office located on the ground floor of the White House.” A second White House statement, a couple of hours later, said that Mr. Obama was injured when another player turned into the president, “who was playing defense, to take a shot when the elbow hit the president in the mouth.” That statement did not name the player responsible for the elbow, but it listed several players who were not: Mr. Obama’s nephew Avery Robinson; Reggie Love, an Obama aide who played basketball for Duke University; and Education Secretary Arne Duncan. Shortly after 5 p.m., the identity of the elbower emerged: Rey Decerega, the director of programs for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. Mr. Decerega said in a statement that the game was all in good fun — and did not apologize. “I learned today the president is both a tough competitor and a good sport,” he said. “I enjoyed playing basketball with him this morning. I’m sure he’ll be back out on the court again soon.” The White House said Mr. Obama was given a local anesthetic while receiving the stitches. The stitches were made with a smaller filament than is typically used, which increases the number of stitches but makes a tighter stitch and results in a smaller scar.",

Several children who received the packets Monday went to the hospital as a precaution, the police said. But no packets were opened, and all of the children were released. The police said the child unknowingly brought the heroin when her mother gave her a different backpack because a pet ruined the regular backpack. The police say the backpack contained nearly 250 packets of heroin. The girl’s mother, Ashley Tull, 30, of Selbyville, was charged with child endangerment and maintaining a drug property. In a phone interview Tuesday, a woman who identified herself as Ms. Tull’s sister, Alicia Tull, said Ashley Tull would not comment.

    "source": "German Village Resists Plans to Strip It Away for the Coal Underneath <eos> ATTERWASCH, Germany — A grove of apple saplings grows on the lee side of Ulrich Schulz’s barn. He did not plant them for the fruit, he said, but as an act of rebellion against a nearby mining company that wants to raze his farm, which his family has owned since 1560, to get at the coal beneath his land. “A nod to Martin Luther,” said Mr. Schulz, 53, gesturing at the two rows of spindly trees. “He said that if he knew the world was coming to an end, he would plant an apple tree.” It may not be the end of the world, but it could be the end of Atterwasch, population 241. While Chancellor Angela Merkel has promised her country a future virtually free of fossil fuels, it may seem strange that this village in eastern Germany, and two neighboring ones, are still fighting plans to wipe them, quite literally, off the map. But Germany’s sudden hunger for coal has emerged as the dirty side of Ms. Merkel’s ambitions to shut down the country’s nuclear power plants by 2022 and eventually move Germans mostly to renewable energy. In fact, last year Germany burned more brown coal than at any time since its Communist-era factories began closing in 1990, according to AG Energiebilanzen, an association that tracks energy consumption. The problem is that there are days when the wind does not blow and clouds fill the sky. With eight nuclear reactors shut since 2011 and the push for renewable energy still in its infancy, the country needs to bridge the power gaps. That has only increased Germans’ craving for coal, even though their energy diet is supposed to be shifting. For Mr. Schulz and his neighbors, the battle to save Atterwasch is akin to not wanting to be the final casualty of a lost war, in a region where about 25,000 people have already been uprooted by mines over the years. “Nobody wants to be the last one,” Mr. Schulz said, contemplating the bright green of a young crop of rye on a balmy winter day. Eckhard Schulz, Ulrich’s brother, said he was struck by that fact recently, while touring the nearby open-pit mine at Jänschwalde with his future son-in-law, a landscaper employed for reclamation projects by Vattenfall , the Swedish company that runs the mine. They encountered a small sign on the spot where a church in the village of Horno had stood for centuries. Until 2003. That was when Horno became the most recent of 136 villages swallowed by open-pit mines in the region of Lusatia since 1924, according to the Archive of Lost Places , a local documentation center about the relocated villages. Video Germany is in the midst of an unprecedented shift to renewable energy, but is still dependent on brown coal. The village of Atterwasch may become a victim of Germany’s hunger for brown coal. “I stopped and I realized in the future, that could be our church,” said Eckhard Schulz, who helps care for the three bells in the tower of Atterwasch’s medieval church. The oldest bell, he notes, was cast in 1460, before Columbus reached America. “Suddenly, I wanted to turn back. I didn’t want to see anything more.” For Vattenfall, the coal miner, Germany’s shift to green energy has, paradoxically, been an unexpected boon. “We have certainly felt the impact of the energy transformation in the last three years,” said Thoralf Schirmer, a spokesman for Vattenfall, which owns five open-pit mines in eastern Germany that extract lignite, or brown coal. The company is petitioning the government to expand three of those mines. “We have seen an increase of the demand for lignite since Germany decided to scale down its nuclear energy, because you need another source of energy to fill in this gap, and this source is lignite,” Mr. Schirmer said. “It is cheap, abundant and easy to get at.” Easy enough, but not if the people of Atterwasch have a say. Vattenfall says it takes relocation very seriously and has sought to begin speaking with the residents about the process. “A house for a house, a school for a school, a church for a church,” Mr. Schirmer said. “Neighbors should be kept together; the structure of the new village should resemble the old.” Image Ulrich Schulz, left, and his father on the farm their family has owned since 1560. Vattenfall wants to raze the farm. Credit Gordon Welters for The New York Times But the villagers are not interested, said Christian Huschga, 43, a scriptwriter who moved to Atterwasch as a child and is now raising two sons here. “We aren’t interested in talking, because the minute we open the dialogue, it makes it look like we are interested in relocating, and we aren’t.” “We want to stay here because we don’t think that it will be necessary, that we will need to dig brown coal from the earth in 20 to 40 years, when we already want to have stopped using fossil fuels. We find that schizophrenic.” The prospect of relocating is an emotional one. A banner declaring “Atterwasch stays!” hangs over the firehouse, and a bright yellow X, a local symbol of resistance, decorates the village church, a rallying point for candlelight vigils and marches. For now, the survival of the village has become a question of endurance, of what will last longer, the determination of residents like the Schulzes to stay or Germans’ appetite for coal. Germany has poured billions into expanding green energy, and the government predicts that the transition could cost up to 550 billion euros ($757 billion) before it is over. So far renewable energy sources have expanded to 23 percent of the country’s supply. But the goal — 80 percent renewables by 2050 — is still a long way off. In addition to providing enough electricity to power millions of households and industry in the region and beyond, the mining industry provides about 10,000 jobs, directly or indirectly, according to local officials. Vattenfall sponsors the local soccer and ice hockey teams, as well as an annual film festival in the main city, Cottbus, and it supports several other cultural and educational institutions.

Credit Gordon Welters for The New York Times “Coal is the foundation of prosperity in the region,” said Lothar Nicht, a deputy mayor in Cottbus, the largest city in Lusatia. Before the first mines opened in the late 1800s, he said, the region was one of Germany’s poorest. After the textile industry’s decline at the end of the last century, mine closings could be fatal. “What is the Plan B? There isn’t one,” Mr. Nicht said. “Nobody knows what will happen in the next 20 to 50 years. The question is what will happen to us? We will once again become the poorhouse of the nation.” For now, the Schulz brothers will not even discuss relocating, choosing instead to focus on fighting to preserve their village. “We are still convinced that we will be able to grow old here, to continue to live and work here,” Ulrich Schulz said. “But no one can say that with certainty.”",

    "source": "Giants Blow 21-Point Lead and Lose to Jaguars for Seventh Straight Defeat <eos> JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — The Giants’ season may already have been lost, but grim realities remain in the shocking and absurd ways they can pivot so quickly from bad to worse. Sunday, they were forced to endure yet another indignity, this time squandering a three-touchdown lead and falling to the Jacksonville Jaguars, 25-24 , on a 43-yard field goal by Josh Scobee with 28 seconds to play. Fittingly, the Giants’ loss — their seventh straight — was sealed by a sack of Eli Manning, who fumbled and allowed the Jaguars to celebrate their second win of the season. Bewildered and beaten again, the Giants trudged off EverBank Field and struggled to explain how the Jaguars had scored two defensive touchdowns and the rookie quarterback Blake Bortles had driven them into field-goal range to win the game. The Giants had reclaimed the lead at 24-22, saved momentarily by a 33-yard Josh Brown field goal with 3 minutes 26 seconds to play. But Bortles led the Jaguars into field-goal range with a 21-yard scramble to the Giants’ 25-yard line, and Scobee delivered the winning kick. Image Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said, “We could have kneeled on the ball in the second half and had a better chance to win.” Credit Phelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press “We could have kneeled on the ball in the second half and had a better chance to win,” Coach Tom Coughlin said. The Giants (3-9) clearly had cured most of their ailments in the first half. They controlled the ball for nearly 21 minutes and scored on three consecutive possessions for a 21-0 lead, and needed only to coast the rest of the way, as haplessly as the Jaguars had played to that point. “I’m not saying we gave up,” left tackle Will Beatty said. “We’ve just got to find ways to finish these close games. You would have thought it was the second team that came out there in the second half.” Coughlin was especially exasperated by the collapse. The team, he said, talked at halftime about not letting the Jaguars back into the game. “We talked about finishing,” he said. “Everyone used the same word and knew what I was talking about. We came out, and you couldn’t script it any better for the other side of the ball.” The Jaguars recovered in astonishing fashion. They rallied to take a 22-21 lead with 12 minutes 56 seconds remaining. On the Giants’ second offensive play of the third quarter, Manning was drilled at the 8-yard line by linebacker Geno Hayes, and the ball bounced backward toward the goal line. J. T. Thomas outmaneuvered two Giants to recover the fumble in the end zone and cut the Jaguars’ deficit to 21-10. Bortles provided more hope with a 30-yard scoring pass to Marqise Lee, whose route involved simply sprinting past cornerback Zack Bowman. The Jaguars seized the lead early in the fourth, when Aaron Colvin returned tight end Larry Donnell’s fumble 41 yards for the score. Donnell was upended and lost the ball as he flipped, landing on his head and giving Jacksonville an opportunity to score a second defensive touchdown in a game for the first time in franchise history. What had started as a Giants landslide turned into a meltdown. “I don’t know an English word to explain the way we feel,” said Rashad Jennings, who rushed for 91 yards and scored two touchdowns. “We have too much talent on this team, so we should be held to a higher standard.” Manning was 24 of 34 for 247 yards and one touchdown. After not being sacked in the first half, he was brought down four times by the Jaguars in the second half. Image Manning was sacked by Sen’Derrick Marks (99) on the Giants’ final possession and fumbled, ensuring their defeat. Credit Phelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press “We just don’t quite have it figured out yet how to win the game,” Manning said. “I don’t know how you teach that.” The Giants sacked Bortles seven times, but he suddenly morphed into a veteran in the second half. He finished the game 21 of 35 for 194 yards, but did not throw an interception and ran for 68 yards, mostly on key scrambles down the stretch. “A rookie quarterback moves it the length of the field at the end of the game to what amounted to a two-minute drive,” Coughlin said. “We get no turnovers, nothing, on our side of the ball. Quite frankly, I was counting on that.” For three straight possessions, the Giants played as well as they had all season. The first of those drives was the team’s longest of the season, a 19-play, 91-yard masterpiece that took 9:51 and ended on the first play of the second quarter as Jennings scored on a 2-yard run. The Giants converted on third down on four occasions on that possession and were so confident in running the ball that Jennings carried 12 times, including the last five plays. Image The Jaguars got to celebrate for just the second time this season, while the Giants left the field dejected for the seventh straight game. Credit John Raoux/Associated Press Manning spurred the next drive with a 32-yard pass to Donnell that put the Giants at the 2-yard line. A false-start penalty pushed them back, but Manning connected with Preston Parker for a 3-yard touchdown and a 14-0 lead. Jennings scored again, ripping off a 17-yard run after Manning turned and casually flipped the ball back to him. Defensively, things looked just as effortless. The Jaguars had only one possession and ran three offensive plays, for 9 yards, in the first quarter. They did not record a first down until there was 5:37 left in the second, and the crowd let out a loud, sarcastic cheer to celebrate the moment. Manning was rarely under duress, completing 15 of 19 passes for 177 yards and compiling a passer rating of 123 in the first half. Jennings had 65 yards on 19 carries, and an offensive line plagued by injuries held together even after right tackle Geoff Schwartz was lost early to an ankle injury. But this has been a tough season for the Giants, and the Jaguars apparently believed they could win no matter how badly the game, and their season, had turned against them. They were right.",

    "source": "BBC to Cut 1,000 Jobs as License Revenue Falls Short <eos> LONDON — The BBC said Thursday that it was cutting 1,000 jobs to help plug a budget gap of 150 million pounds caused by a larger decline than expected in the number of households owning televisions, as viewers increasingly choose to watch content free online. The BBC is financed in part by a license fee system in which every British household with a television pays £145.50, or about $230, a year to the BBC. That helps generate about £3.7 billion for the corporation. Television owners 75 or older are exempt. The BBC said viewers were increasingly using their hand-held devices or going online to catch up on missed programs, suggesting that the BBC needed to update its business model for the digital age by extending the license fee to include digital services. The BBC director general, Tony Hall, was quoted by the BBC News website as saying that more than one million fewer people had a television set than had been forecast by the corporation in 2011, creating the shortfall. He said the organization faced a “difficult choice” because of the challenging economic environment, the BBC reported. “We’ve already significantly cut the costs of running the BBC, but in times of very tough choices we need to focus on what really matters — delivering outstanding programs and content for all our audiences,” he said in a statement. The reduction, which amounts to about 5 percent of BBC’s work force, comes as media companies across the globe, including The New York Times Company, are grappling with how to increase revenue and compel viewers or readers to pay for content. At the BBC, Lord Hall said the cost-cutting drive would include the elimination of senior management roles and the streamlining of staff in marketing, communication and human resources. The cuts should generate savings of £50 million, he said. The BBC has faced several challenges in recent years that have dented public confidence, including criticism over its handling of the allegations of sexual abuse against the television personality Jimmy Savile; attacks by conservative politicians against a perceived left-wing bias; and a debate about the future viability of the license fee system, whose revenues some critics have argued should be shared with other broadcasters.",

    "source": "Desperately Protecting A.I.G.’s House of Cards <eos> Next week, perhaps as early as Monday, the American International Group is going to report the largest quarterly loss in history. Rumors suggest it will be around $60 billion, which will affirm, yet again, A.I.G.’s sorry status as the most crippled of all the nation’s wounded financial institutions. The recent quarterly losses suffered by Merrill Lynch and Citigroup — “only” $15.4 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively — pale by comparison. At the same time A.I.G. reveals its loss, the federal government is also likely to announce — yet again! — a new plan to save A.I.G., the third since September. So far the government has thrown $150 billion at the company, in loans, investments and equity injections, to keep it afloat. It has softened the terms it set for the original $85 billion loan it made back in September. To ease the pressure even more, the Federal Reserve actually runs a facility that buys toxic assets that A.I.G. had insured. A.I.G. effectively has been nationalized, with the government owning a hair under 80 percent of the stock. Not that it’s worth very much; A.I.G. shares closed Friday at 42 cents. Donn Vickrey, who runs the independent research firm Gradient Analytics, predicts that A.I.G. is going to cost taxpayers at least $100 billion more before it finally stabilizes, by which time the company will almost surely have been broken into pieces, with the government owning large chunks of it. A quarter of a trillion dollars, if it comes to that, is an astounding amount of money to hand over to one company to prevent it from going bust. Yet the government feels it has no choice: because of A.I.G.’s dubious business practices during the housing bubble it pretty much has the world’s financial system by the throat. If we let A.I.G. fail, said Seamus P. McMahon, a banking expert at Booz & Company, other institutions, including pension funds and American and European banks “will face their own capital and liquidity crisis, and we could have a domino effect.” A bailout of A.I.G. is really a bailout of its trading partners — which essentially constitutes the entire Western banking system. I don’t doubt this bit of conventional wisdom; after the calamity that followed the fall of Lehman Brothers, which was far less enmeshed in the global financial system than A.I.G., who would dare allow the world’s biggest insurer to fail? Who would want to take that risk? But that doesn’t mean we should feel resigned about what is happening at A.I.G. In fact, we should be furious. More than even Citi or Merrill, A.I.G. is ground zero for the practices that led the financial system to ruin. “They were the worst of them all,” said Frank Partnoy, a law professor at the University of San Diego and a derivatives expert. Mr. Vickrey of Gradient Analytics said, “It was extreme hubris, fueled by greed.” Other firms used many of the same shady techniques as A.I.G., but none did them on such a broad scale and with such utter recklessness. And yet — and this is the part that should make your blood boil — the company is being kept alive precisely because it behaved so badly.  When you start asking around about how A.I.G. made money during the housing bubble, you hear the same two phrases again and again: “regulatory arbitrage” and “ratings arbitrage.” The word “arbitrage” usually means taking advantage of a price differential between two securities — a bond and stock of the same company, for instance — that are related in some way. When the word is used to describe A.I.G.’s actions, however, it means something entirely different. It means taking advantage of a loophole in the rules. A less polite but perhaps more accurate term would be “scam.” As a huge multinational insurance company, with a storied history and a reputation for being extremely well run, A.I.G. had one of the most precious prizes in all of business: an AAA rating, held by no more than a dozen or so companies in the United States. That meant ratings agencies believed its chance of defaulting was just about zero. It also meant it could borrow more cheaply than other companies with lower ratings. To be sure, most of A.I.G. operated the way it always had, like a normal, regulated insurance company. (Its insurance divisions remain profitable today.) But one division, its “financial practices” unit in London, was filled with go-go financial wizards who devised new and clever ways of taking advantage of Wall Street’s insatiable appetite for mortgage-backed securities. Unlike many of the Wall Street investment banks, A.I.G. didn’t specialize in pooling subprime mortgages into securities. Instead, it sold credit-default swaps . These exotic instruments acted as a form of insurance for the securities. In effect, A.I.G. was saying if, by some remote chance (ha!) those mortgage-backed securities suffered losses, the company would be on the hook for the losses. And because A.I.G. had that AAA rating, when it sprinkled its holy water over those mortgage-backed securities, suddenly they had AAA ratings too. That was the ratings arbitrage. “It was a way to exploit the triple A rating,” said Robert J. Arvanitis, a former A.I.G. executive who has since become a leading A.I.G. critic. Why would Wall Street and the banks go for this? Because it shifted the risk of default from themselves to A.I.G., and the AAA rating made the securities much easier to market. What was in it for A.I.G.? Lucrative fees, naturally. But it also saw the fees as risk-free money; surely it would never have to actually pay up. Like everyone else on Wall Street, A.I.G. operated on the belief that the underlying assets — housing — could only go up in price. That foolhardy belief, in turn, led A.I.G. to commit several other stupid mistakes. When a company insures against, say, floods or earthquakes, it has to put money in reserve in case a flood happens. That’s why, as a rule, insurance companies are usually overcapitalized, with low debt ratios. But because credit-default swaps were not regulated, and were not even categorized as a traditional insurance product, A.I.G. didn’t have to put anything aside for losses. And it didn’t. Its leverage was more akin to an investment bank than an insurance company. So when housing prices started falling, and losses started piling up, it had no way to pay them off. Not understanding the real risk, the company grievously mispriced it. Second, in many of its derivative contracts, A.I.G. included a provision that has since come back to haunt it. It agreed to something called “collateral triggers,” meaning that if certain events took place, like a ratings downgrade for either A.I.G. or the securities it was insuring, it would have to put up collateral against those securities. Again, the reasons it agreed to the collateral triggers was pure greed: it could get higher fees by including them. And again, it assumed that the triggers would never actually kick in and the provisions were therefore meaningless. Those collateral triggers have since cost A.I.G. many, many billions of dollars. Or, rather, they’ve cost American taxpayers billions. The regulatory arbitrage was even seamier. A huge part of the company’s credit-default swap business was devised, quite simply, to allow banks to make their balance sheets look safer than they really were. Under a misguided set of international rules that took hold toward the end of the 1990s, banks were allowed use their own internal risk measurements to set their capital requirements. The less risky the assets, obviously, the lower the regulatory capital requirement. How did banks get their risk measures low? It certainly wasn’t by owning less risky assets. Instead, they simply bought A.I.G.’s credit-default swaps. The swaps meant that the risk of loss was transferred to A.I.G., and the collateral triggers made the bank portfolios look absolutely risk-free. Which meant minimal capital requirements, which the banks all wanted so they could increase their leverage and buy yet more “risk-free” assets. This practice became especially rampant in Europe. That lack of capital is one of the reasons the European banks have been in such trouble since the crisis began.  At its peak, the A.I.G. credit-default business had a “notional value” of $450 billion, and as recently as September, it was still over $300 billion. (Notional value is the amount A.I.G. would owe if every one of its bets went to zero.) And unlike most Wall Street firms, it didn’t hedge its credit-default swaps; it bore the risk, which is what insurance companies do. It’s not as if this was some Enron-esque secret, either. Everybody knew the capital requirements were being gamed, including the regulators. Indeed, A.I.G. openly labeled that part of the business as “regulatory capital.” That is how they, and their customers, thought of it. There’s more, believe it or not. A.I.G. sold something called 2a-7 puts, which allowed money market funds to invest in risky bonds even though they are supposed to be holding only the safest commercial paper . How could they do this? A.I.G. agreed to buy back the bonds if they went bad. (Incredibly, the Securities and Exchange Commission went along with this.) A.I.G. had a securities lending program, in which it would lend securities to investors, like short-sellers, in return for cash collateral. What did it do with the money it received? Incredibly, it bought mortgage-backed securities. When the firms wanted their collateral back, it had sunk in value, thanks to A.I.G.’s foolish investment strategy. The practice has cost A.I.G. — oops, I mean American taxpayers — billions. Here’s what is most infuriating: Here we are now, fully aware of how these scams worked. Yet for all practical purposes, the government has to keep them going. Indeed, that may be the single most important reason it can’t let A.I.G. fail. If the company defaulted, hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of credit-default swaps would “blow up,” and all those European banks whose toxic assets are supposedly insured by A.I.G. would suddenly be sitting on immense losses. Their already shaky capital structures would be destroyed. A.I.G. helped create the illusion of regulatory capital with its swaps, and now the government has to actually back up those contracts with taxpayer money to keep the banks from collapsing. It would be funny if it weren’t so awful. I asked Mr. Arvanitis, the former A.I.G. executive, if the company viewed what it had done during the bubble as a form of gaming the system. “Oh no,” he said, “they never thought of it as abuse. They thought of themselves as satisfying their customers.” That’s either a remarkable example of the power of rationalization, or they were lying to themselves, figuring that when the house of cards finally fell, somebody else would have to clean it up. That would be us, the taxpayers.",

    "source": "Ryan Palmer Leads the Byron Nelson After ‘Hard Day of Golf’ <eos> Ryan Palmer sat down after finishing his third round Saturday and put his head down on the table. He was exhausted — and still leading — after a three-over 73 on a gusty day at the Byron Nelson Championship in Irving, Tex. Palmer, a Texas native who had made the cut only once in his first seven appearances at the tournament, has a one-stroke lead over Sergio García after a sun-soaked but brutal day for scoring at T.P.C. Four Seasons. “We chalked it up as a hard day of golf,” Palmer said. “If you had told me Thursday I was going to have a one-shot lead, I would have called you a liar and said, Whatever. But my bad round is out of the way, I think, and I still lead by one.” García shot a 74 while also making bogeys at the 16th and 18th holes, where he missed makable putts. “I could not shoot one shot higher than I did,” García said. “So if you look at it that way, and I’m only one shot behind Ryan, and I have tomorrow, I think it’s pretty positive.” The last three holes played into the wind, which was about 25 miles per hour with gusts near 40. Only 8 of 74 players shot under par Saturday, and there were no bogey-free rounds. “Obviously, the scores show how hard it was,” Palmer said. “Bad, hard day, that is for sure.” The best score was a 67 by Argon Atwal, who is tied with Ryuji Imada (70) for third place at three under. “You catch the wrong gust and you could be in serious trouble,” Atwal said. Gary Woodland and Matt Kuchar shot 68s and were tied with Joe Ogilvie (72) for fifth at two under. TWO TIED FOR LEAD IN ENGLAND The Italian teenager Matteo Manassero and second-ranked Luke Donald shared the lead in the BMW PGA Championship after three rounds in Virginia Water, England. They each shot a one-over 72, leaving them at five-under 208. Manassero had two birdies and three bogeys in an erratic front nine before making nine straight pars. Donald dropped five strokes heading into the turn but regained four on a flawless back nine. Top-ranked Lee Westwood and Fabrizio Zanotti of Paraguay shot 69s and are two strokes back. IRWIN SHARES LEAD Hale Irwin overcame a four-shot deficit to grab the lead, then frittered it away with a double bogey on the last hole to drop into a tie with Kiyoshi Murota at the Senior P.G.A. Championship in Louisville, Ky. A victory would make Irwin, who will be 66 on Friday, the senior tour’s oldest winner. Irwin, who shot a two-under 70, and Murota, who battled back pain to shoot a 74, were at nine-under 207 at Valhalla Golf Club. The Hall of Famer Tom Watson, the 2007 Senior P.G.A. champion, shot a 68 and was one shot back. YOUNG MAKES EIGHT BIRDIES Heather Bowie Young made eight birdies in a six-under-par 66 that gave her a two-shot lead at the L.P.G.A. Tour’s Brazil Cup at Itanhanga Golf Club in Rio de Janeiro. Young seized the lead by making five birdies on the front nine in the 30-player exhibition. Suzann Pettersen, who won last week’s match play event in Gladstone, N.J., was tied for second with Lindsey Wright at two strokes behind.",

    "source": "Florida Senate Committee Rejects Medicaid Expansion <eos> MIAMI — Rebuffing Gov. Rick Scott’s support of Medicaid expansion, a Florida Senate committee on Monday rejected the idea, all but ending the possibility that the state would add more poor people to Medicaid rolls. But the Senate panel debating the expansion proposed a compromise: to accept the federal money but use it to put low-income people into private insurance plans. Accepting the money would please the governor and a number of Floridians, while steering people away from Medicaid, which many lawmakers and residents view as troubled. The committee vote to reject a Medicaid expansion under President Obama’s health care overhaul was 7 to 4, with Democrats voting for the expansion. Last week, a Florida House committee voted to reject Medicaid expansion altogether, saying that the system was broken and that adding people to the rolls would cost taxpayers too much money in the long run. The House speaker, Will Weatherford, a Republican, said it was the wrong approach, calling it a “dangerous path.” From the start, Mr. Scott knew it would be difficult for the Florida Legislature to embrace Medicaid expansion, even for only three years, which is what he proposed. The governor had staked his political career on derailing what he calls “Obamacare,” and his abrupt reversal did not endear him to conservatives in Florida or in the Legislature. Last week, he made it clear he was not going to lobby the Legislature on Medicaid, preferring to use his influence to push through raises for teachers and eliminate a manufacturing sales tax. “I am confident that the Legislature will do the right thing and find a way to protect taxpayers and the uninsured in our state while the new health care law provides 100 percent funding,” Mr. Scott said in a statement Monday after the vote. A Senate committee will convene to develop a plan that would use federal dollars under the law to expand Florida Healthy Kids , a well-established, well-liked health care exchange for low-income children. The proposal would allow the one million uninsured adults who qualify under the health care law to join and choose among various insurance plans. They would pay on a sliding scale, depending on income. “I think it’s important for us to say no to having Washington tell us to expand our Medicaid program,” said Senator Joe Negron, the Republican chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, who made the Healthy Kids proposal. But, he said, the committee still hopes to address the larger problem. “We want to try to find a creative way to help people, empower people to have their own private health insurance but not put them into the Medicaid program,” he said. Democrats said they were pleased that the Senate panel chose to accept the money, even if it meant taking a different approach. “A rose, by any other name, is still a rose,” said Senator Audrey Gibson, a Democrat on the panel. “This move is long overdue and one the House would be wise to emulate.” It is unclear whether the Obama administration would accept such a proposal. Several states, including Arkansas, Indiana and Ohio, are exploring using private insurers to enroll uninsured patients. The administration recently agreed to a proposal by the Democratic governor of Arkansas, Mike Beebe, who sought to reject Medicaid expansion and use federal money to buy private health insurance for its uninsured residents who qualify. The Senate proposal would also have to clear the House, which is working on its own proposal and has taken a more conservative line.",

    "source": "HSN Joins With Univision to Reach the Hispanic Market <eos> HSN, the home shopping network, is turning its sights toward Hispanic consumers with the announcement of a new e-commerce partnership with Univision Communications that will begin on Thursday. The three-year partnership will take the form of a shopping portal on Univision.com called Boutique Univision that will feature a variety of products from HSN targeted at Hispanics. “This is the fastest-growing consumer group and they will be driving the U.S. economy over the next few decades,” said Bill Brand, the chief marketing and business development officer at HSN Inc. “We are able to reach this Hispanic consumer through the most trusted brand in their community, and that’s Univision. That’s an unprecedented opportunity for us.” The effort is not the first time HSN has tried to reach a Spanish-speaking audience. In 1998, the company created a Spanish language television show called “Home Shopping en Español” that ran through 2002 and aired in Mexico and Puerto Rico, as well as on Galavision, a Univision-owned network. In addition to increasing product sales, the goal is to expand the company’s reach with Hispanic consumers, which Mr. Brand said represent 10 percent of HSN’s customer base. According to data from comScore, Hispanics in the United States are slightly less active on e-commerce and retail websites than all consumers. While 84 percent of all American consumers visited a retail website in October, just 80 percent of Hispanics did. The product categories on the Boutique Univision will include electronics, fashion beauty, home décor and cookware from brands like Vince Camuto, Samsung, Apple, Curtis Stone and Lancôme. Each day the site will feature one product to be offered at a promotional discount. Tonia O’Connor, the president for content distribution and corporate business development at Univision, said the portal was not “just a pure translation for what exists for general market shoppers,” but instead was a “customized shopping experience” with products selected specifically for Hispanic customers. Image Boutique Univision, a shopping portal on Univision.com that will start Thursday, will feature a variety of products from HSN directed at Hispanics. “We’re trying to create a beautiful storefront that’s inviting and that welcomes the shoppers in,” Ms. O’Connor said. Promotion for the online boutique will begin on Thursday and feature Lesley Ann Machado, a host from HSN, on the popular Univision morning show “ Despierta América .” Ms. Machado and Maggie Jiménez from “Despierta America” will announce the new portal. HSN will then feature a live feed of the announcement during a segment on its network featuring the chef Lorena Garcia. On Thursday, Ms. Jiménez will be a guest on the HSN show “Beauty Report” where she will discuss the boutique and other beauty tips and products. The hosts will also use social media to promote the initiative throughout the day. Additional promotions include digital and radio ads and emails that Univision will send to its viewers. Univision has used its morning show to promote brands before. In 2012, the show featured a fall fashion segment sponsored by Target to promote the retailer’s collection by the designer Phillip Lim. Ms. O’Connor said the promotions for the products featured in the new boutique would be tasteful. “It’s not going to be an overt sales pitch in the middle of our morning show,” she said. “It will be a subtle approach done in a way that is informative and showcasing the product itself.” As brands and media companies find more ways to move beyond traditional forms of advertising and into product placement and integrations, the line between content and marketing are increasingly blurry. “We don’t intend for any of our shows to become a block of home shopping,” Ms. O’Connor said. “We are sensitive to the right level of integration into the show.” Silvia Galfo, the senior vice president for marketing at Lancôme, said reaching the Hispanic market was a “key priority” for the brand. “It’s our No. 1 diverse customer,” Ms. Galfo said. “These women are beauty savvy across all categories.” The company has done both qualitative and quantitative research on Hispanic women customers and found that the product categories they are most interested in are skin care products with an emphasis on correcting dark spots on the skin, eye makeup for creating dramatic eye looks and fragrances, Ms. Galfo said. The products featured in the new boutique will reflect those choices, including the perfume Tresor, eye shadows and mascara to help women create a “cat eye” look that Ms. Galfo said was popular among Hispanic women. “We really see the potential of this fastest-growing customer group,” she said. “We have to make sure that we talk to them in the right language.”",

    "source": "Plushenko, the Quad King, Is Back for More <eos> TALLINN, Estonia — Yet another gold medal was in his possession, and with a sly smile, Yevgeny Plushenko extended his right arm and let his hand tremble. The hand represented his rivals at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. “I’m going to take any result, but I think I did something already for figure skating, to come back and skate not bad and win,” he said after winning the European figure skating championship last month. “I know the other athletes, they understand right now they need something, and they start to shake right now, to shake a little bit.” After retiring from elite competition in 2006, Plushenko restricted his skating to television programs, his exhibition tour and the 2008 Eurovision song contest, which he helped his friend Dima Bilan win for Russia. Plushenko said that during those three years, he did not once attempt a quadruple jump, the element that had made him his sport’s dominant figure. But when Plushenko took to the ice here at the European championships, it was as if he had never been away as he opened with a clean quadruple toe loop-triple toe combination in the short program and in the free program. The quad was back in earnest, and so was Plushenko, just in time to try to defend the Olympic title he won in Turin, Italy, in 2006. “I respected him before, but I respect him even more now,” said Robin Wagner, the American coach who helped Sarah Hughes win the women’s Olympic title in 2002. “I don’t think people realize how difficult it is to come back at that level. It was already hard enough before the rule changes.” For singles skaters, there are ample reminders, both distant and recent, of the challenge: from the men’s stars Brian Boitano, Kurt Browning and Viktor Petrenko, who all failed to win an Olympic medal in 1994, to Sasha Cohen, who failed to qualify for the United States Olympic team this year. Even after multiple knee operations, Plushenko, 27, believes he is still in his physical prime, although he did not feel that way when he resumed serious training in June with his longtime coach, Aleksei Mishin, in St. Petersburg, Russia. For the first three months, Plushenko said, it was unbelievable. “It was too hard,” he said. “Wake up in the morning at 7, going to first practice, then off ice, then gym, then two hours’ break and then again practice on the ice and then again off ice, because I needed to lose 10 kilos.” (Ten kilograms is about 22 pounds.) “My muscles felt like stones all the time, because everything was in pain,” he said. “When I wake up in the morning, I needed 30 minutes to be able to walk.” He is trim and fit now, but there have been setbacks. He said he had twice had to have fluid drained from a cyst near his right Achilles’ tendon. He said he also had had painkilling injections in his left knee and planned to have minor meniscus surgery after the season. After practicing and landing some unprecedented jumps in training last year — including a quadruple toe-quadruple toe combination — he has scaled back his jumping in training. “I had problems, so now I do maximum three quadruples in practice,” he said. “Land or not land, no more.” But he says he is energized and content, and his wife of six months, Yana Rudkovskaya, agrees. “I understood that he really missed the life of a competitor,” Rudkovskaya said through an interpreter. “When he started competing again, there was a fire in his life. He is much happier.” Plushenko’s first marriage, to Maria Ermak, ended in divorce after less than three years in 2008. He and Ermak have a 3-year-old son together. Plushenko met Rudkovskaya, a 35-year-old fashion entrepreneur and mother of two sons, through the music business. Rudkovskaya runs a chain of beauty salons in Russia, but she is also the producer for Bilan, one of the most popular singers in Russia. Rudkovskaya, who was in Tallinn to watch Plushenko, was one of the forces behind his comeback. “My wife brought me back to this sport,” Plushenko said. “She told me, ‘Yevgeny, before we were married, I know you have all titles and were Olympic champion and a silver medalist in the Olympics, but you know, now you can be two times Olympic champion.’ “And I was like: ‘Yana! Come on! It’s not possible, because I didn’t skate for three and a half years, and I had a lot of surgeries, and I’m 27 years old.’ ” Plushenko made it clear that his comeback was not just for his new bride. After watching Jeffrey Buttle and Evan Lysacek win the last two world championships without completing a quad, Plushenko was aware there was an opportunity, as well as a financial opportunity. But his comeback was also about returning to what he does best after several years of driving fast cars and testing alternate professions, which included becoming a member of St. Petersburg’s parliament. “I’m in the government, still in the government actually, but it’s something that’s not mine, you know?” he said. “I need some more adrenaline, need this great atmosphere like we have in competition. You come to the ice and you are alone, and everybody is watching you, and you need to perform. It’s hard, but it’s great.” And to hear Plushenko tell it, anything beats politics. “Dirty, dirty thing,” he said. “Show business is dirty, but politics is unbelievable. You can talk like this with the people, and they are going to turn and say behind your back: ‘Bam. Bam. Bam.’ Not good things. I saw this, and, of course, I hated it. We have in figure skating this situation, too, but in politics, it’s — wow.” That last word also applied to his poised performance in Tallinn. “I think in some areas of skating, he’s even better than in Turin,” said Mishin, Plushenko’s coach. “In Turin, he was more a boy. Now he’s more a man.” Plushenko underscored his jumping prowess in the skate-and-giggle exhibition program here by completing two triple axels, a jump that the silver medalist, Stéphane Lambiel of Switzerland, could not do in the regular competition. Some analysts consider Plushenko a solid favorite for a gold medal in a deep men’s field that includes Lysacek, the reigning world champion; Daisuke Takahashi of Japan; and Patrick Chan of Canada. Plushenko has not done two quads in a program yet, but he insists that is part of his plan for Vancouver. “I thought that Plushenko was strong, really strong, right here,” said the former French skating star Philippe Candeloro, pointing to his head. But there is an alternative view to his gold medal prospects, one that says Plushenko’s artistic limitations could trip him up along with his relative weaknesses in some of the skills that are observed and scored more thoroughly in the contemporary scoring system. Lambiel, despite a free program with two major errors, received higher scores for program components than Plushenko, who still seems hardwired to get manic when the time comes to get artistic, gesticulating as if less were definitely not more. “There are better skaters than him, and they can have choreography that is better than him,” said the young Czech skater Michal Brezina, who finished fourth in Tallinn. “But when he’s on the ice and he does every jump like this,” Brezina said, snapping his fingers metronomically, “then what can you say? Nobody can beat him, because if he’s doing two quads, one with the combination with the triple and then two triple axels, he has more points than anybody.”",

    "source": "Gonzaga Hears Cheers That Used to Be Theirs <eos> SALT LAKE CITY — The N.C.A.A. tournament unfolded here as if in some sort of parallel universe: the conversation dominated by Gonzaga, the spotlight stolen by Harvard. The Zags, long darlings of college basketball’s postseason, entered this year ranked among the favorites, stumbled against a No. 16 seed in Southern and withstood a neutral crowd turned obviously — and loudly — in favor of their overmatched opponent. That used to happen for the Zags, not to them. Harvard, meanwhile, captured its first-ever win in the tournament, a victory that slid the Crimson into the darling role once occupied by Gonzaga and others. Harvard, its team, its athletic department and its campus filled with future rulers of the world, had become an underdog — this, specifically, was in basketball, if in little else. Image Siyani Chambers, left, and Laurent Rivard after Harvard’s victory Thursday at Salt Lake City. Credit Harry How/Getty Images For Matt Santangelo, the Gonzaga guard for the beginning of its run, the radio analyst who watched both teams play on Thursday, it was an odd juxtaposition. As he watched the Zags cling for their tournament life against the Jaguars, then watched the Crimson dismantle New Mexico, he identified more with Harvard, less with his alma mater. “The Harvards, all the upsets, that’s exactly who we were,” Santangelo said. “I mean, that was the first time I’ve ever been at a G.U. game where the neutral fan rooted against G.U. Like the building blew up a couple times, and it was not in our favor.” So, he is asked, you felt a lot like Duke? “Basically,” Santangelo responded. Santangelo played on the 1998-99 team that shined a national spotlight on Gonzaga basketball, that made an N.C.A.A. regional final and started the run of consecutive tournament appearances, a run with no end in sight. He points to two demarcation lines: everything that happened before and after 1999, and everything that happened before and after forward Adam Morrison arrived in 2003. For those post-1999 teams, “everything was new and fresh,” Santangelo said. “After Adam, that expectation was set. Now you’re the big dog, the big fish.” Image Kelly Olynyk, a 7-footer for top-seeded and top-ranked Gonzaga. Credit Streeter Lecka/Getty Images This season, then, was a natural extension, the next step in Gonzaga’s basketball evolution. The first No. 1 ranking in program history. The first No. 1 seed in program history. The first time the Zags were forced to defend whether they deserved a top seed in the first place, the vitriol higher in volume, more intense. Gonzaga, once lovable, once the buster of brackets, now felt, as Santangelo admitted, a little bit the way those Duke teams always felt. That was especially acute on Thursday, when Southern kept the game close, withstood the expected Gonzaga knockout blow and made another run. The crowd, save for the Zags loyalists, screamed for the historic upset, screamed against the Zags. “It’s not a position we’ve been in a lot,” guard Mike Hart said. “It was weird.” In the locker room afterward, Coach Mark Few reminded his players that nothing in this tournament would come easy, that “the longer this thing goes, you’re going to see pretty much everybody in the whole arena slide over to the other side.” He told his players it did not matter whether they missed an easy shot, or blew an assignment — they needed to move on. Santangelo hoped Gonzaga would embrace this newfound role, to play like a tournament favorite. The Zags struggled in the first half of the first game after they obtained their first No. 1 ranking, same as in their first game as a No. 1 seed. Image Wesley Saunders, left, and New Mexico’s Alex Kirk during 14th-seeded Harvard’s win on Thursday. Credit George Frey/Associated Press “There are two ways to go about it,” he said. “Either ‘We’re going to play at our level, and if you don’t come to our level, we’re going to blow you out of the gym.’ Or ‘We’re angry. Yes, we got the votes, but there’s a lot of scrutiny. We’re going to show you guys.’ ” Life was much easier as an underdog. Just ask Harvard. The Crimson took a victory lap on Friday, even as their next game loomed. The players answered questions about why they went to Harvard in the first place, their hardest classes, whether they considered themselves nerds. One reporter asked guard Christian Webster what he thought of the story line elicited from Harvard’s upset: that the cute, smart kids had prevailed, revenge of the brainiest. “I don’t know about us being that cute,” he deadpanned. “But it has been overwhelming.” The Harvard players all said they went there because they believed in the vision of Tommy Amaker, the coach. They clinched the Ivy League title on the final weekend of the regular season, with wins over Columbia and Cornell. They overcame the loss of two star players snared in a widespread academic scandal, one that Amaker called “very unfortunate” but labeled a “universitywide situation” and “not a basketball or athletics deal.” Anyway, as this parallel universe played out, the bracket in the West Region opened up with upset after upset after upset. Harvard had taken out the third seed in New Mexico, but then on Friday, fourth-seeded Kansas State lost, and so did fifth-seeded Wisconsin. That left No. 6 Arizona, Harvard’s opponent Saturday, as the highest remaining seed other than the top two, Gonzaga and Ohio State. Image Earlier, Jameel Grace of Southern drove against Elias Harris and David Stockton (11) of Gonzaga. Credit Streeter Lecka/Getty Images Santangelo said the Zags’ victories in the 1999 run did produce a carry-over effect. They gave Gonzaga more confidence as it moved forward. He did not believe the current Bulldogs would be as susceptible to any carry-over, though. Too much talent. Too much size. “Fourteen years I’ve been in the N.C.A.A. tournament,” the assistant Tommy Lloyd said. “I don’t know how many times we’ve played unbelievable in the first game. Thursday and Friday everybody is like, oh, the Zags, they’re for real, they’re going to go to the Final Four. And then we lose on Saturday.” Lloyd chose to focus on the way Gonzaga’s first game ended, with a surge back ahead, more proof of a team he called “the best in the country in the last four minutes this season.” Gonzaga, he said, “did not limp out of there.” It made the plays it needed to. Same as Harvard. Perhaps Gonzaga needed to shake off the rust from its long break after the West Coast Conference tournament. Perhaps it needed to acclimate to its new status among the favorites. “This is where you want to be,” Lloyd said. “I don’t think you say, ‘I don’t want to be 30-2. I’d rather be 24-8 with a chip on our shoulder.’ If the crowd comes with the territory, if we’re big, bad Gonzaga, that’s fine by me. You want to survive. You want to advance.” In this parallel universe, with Gonzaga as the powerhouse and Harvard in the Gonzaga role, that was enough. For both of them.",

    "source": "A ‘Safe Haven’ Looks Less Secure <eos> With a flight to quality last year pushing up Treasury bond prices and risky loans looking like losses waiting to happen, banks plowed money into government bonds. And until about mid-May, when prices of 10-year securities topped 100 cents on the dollar, that looked like a good bet. Now, however, this safe haven does not look so secure. A rebound in risk appetite and worries about America’s credit rating have drained some air from the Treasury market bubble. A 10-year bond now fetches only a little over 95 cents on the dollar. That may not seem like much of a drop, but if you think of banks leveraging up their positions, it could result in some nasty losses. How much so? American depository institutions hold some $581 billion in various types of government obligations on reserve with the central bank, according to Federal Reserve statistics. Of course, the cost of financing these positions has also plummeted. The London interbank offered rate for three-month dollar borrowings is now a mere two-thirds of a percentage point. And a steeper yield curve is a boon for banks looking to earn their way out of trouble through fat net interest margins. But one could argue that Libor is being artificially depressed as a result of intervention by the United States government to prop up bank credit. If the government were to withdraw those measures — say, by pulling its borrowing guarantees, its liberal discount window collateral requirements or other programs — Libor could easily rise to a level appropriate for the industry’s average single-A to double-A credit. That was over 5 percent in 2006, for example. Should that happen, and if longer rates were also to struggle higher, banks would run the risk of losing money on their hordes of Treasuries, just when their plummeting prices make them hardest to unload. If so, this port in the storm could turn out to be quite choppy. Seeking Simple Rules The government’s plan to get bad assets off bank balance sheets always carried the risk that banks could game it. But the Public Private Investment Program won’t work if Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation set overly complicated rules, whether on avoiding bank conflicts or in any other part of the plan. So they need to settle for simplicity — which means imperfection. The Treasury’s plan involves the government subsidizing buyers of banks’ bad assets by offering cheap nonrecourse leverage. The idea is to give investors a chance to make money and to get illiquid markets moving and help increase asset prices toward the levels that banks are holding them, thereby minimizing further losses if they offload them. It is clear banks should not be buyers and sellers of the same assets. That would make it too easy to artificially inflate asset values and transfer remaining losses to American taxpayers. But industry groups are lobbying for banks to be allowed to participate, in a general sense, as buyers under the program as well as sellers. Yet having banks buy each other’s bad assets runs the risk of a similar artificial result. After all, a “you buy mine and I’ll buy yours” attitude among banks helped sustain the structuring and sale of questionable securitized products for longer than might otherwise have occurred. But banning banks that could be sellers from participating as buyers sounds both impractical and potentially damaging to the program. That is because banks are significant participants in all kinds of markets through their in-house investment desks and asset management affiliates, and excluding all their tentacles would reduce investor interest as well as being a logistical nightmare. The answer could be some simple rules, bearing in mind that most investors in the Public Private Investment Program are expected to be pooled together in funds run by asset managers. Banks could (and should) be banned from having any material interest in any pool buying their own assets. They could be restricted to a modest (say 10 percent) interest in any pool buying assets from other banks. There may be other options. But whatever solution the Treasury and the F.D.I.C. devises needs to be straightforward. Some gaming of the system could still occur, and taxpayer-supported banks could make money out of program, too. That might be galling to some, but it could be the price of the program’s success. After all, as the American Bankers Association, led by Edward L. Yingling, noted in a comment letter to the F.D.I.C., it would be somewhat odd “to hamper a program designed to benefit banks because of a concern that banks would benefit.”",

    "source": "Ex-Libya Intelligence Chief Captured in Mauritania <eos> TRIPOLI, Libya — Abdullah el-Senussi, the former intelligence chief and brother-in-law of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, was arrested Saturday at an airport in Mauritania, the authorities there said, in the most significant capture of a former official of the Qaddafi government since the apprehension of the dictator’s son Seif al-Islam by Libyan fighters in November. The International Criminal Court has indicted Mr. Senussi, Seif al-Islam and Colonel Qaddafi on accusations of crimes against humanity committed during the government’s attempts to crush the rebellion last year that ultimately ousted the Libyan leader. Colonel Qaddafi was killed by Libyan fighters shortly after his capture in October. During his years as intelligence chief, Mr. Senussi presided over the surveillance, detention, torture and assassination of probably thousands of Libyans. Aside from Colonel Qaddafi himself, Mr. Senussi was the most reviled figure in the former government. After the fall of Tripoli, journalists were able to walk through his headquarters, including his own grand corner office, the fitness facility used by his men, the tiny cells scrawled with the desperate prayers of the inmates who had been housed there, and larger rooms used for torture and beatings. Besides being wanted by the international court, Mr. Senussi was also sought for arrest by France, where he and five other Libyans were sentenced in absentia to life in prison for the 1989 bombing of a passenger airplane over Niger that killed all 170 people, many of them French. Libyans also believe he was responsible for the brutal 1996 crackdown on a riot at Abu Salim prison in Tripoli that left 1,200 dead. A demonstration last year by the families of the dead became the spark that ignited the Libyan uprising. It was unclear on Saturday what Mauritania planned to do with Mr. Senussi. France — which announced that it helped in the arrest, according to news reports — Libya and the International Criminal Court had all either asked to take custody of him or said they planned to. Libya’s interim government said in a statement that it was prepared to receive Mr. Senussi and guarantee him a free trial. But the Libyan justice system was always plagued with corruption and favoritism under Colonel Qaddafi, and the interim authorities have acknowledged that they are still working to rebuild it on a firmer foundation. The fate of Seif al-Islam remains unclear. Libyan fighters from the Western town of Zintan continue to hold him captive, and have refused to turn him over to Libya’s interim Justice Ministry. It is unclear whether Libyan authorities would hand him over for trial at the International Criminal Court if they took him into custody. Since the fall of Tripoli last August, Libyan fighters have repeatedly claimed, without proof, that they had captured Mr. Senussi. But officials of Libya’s interim government had never confirmed his capture. Instead, rumors of his whereabouts swirled around Tripoli, with one militia-leader-turned politician even boasting that he personally held Mr. Senussi in his custody. Former Qaddafi government figures, speaking on the condition of anonymity for their own safety, have said that Mr. Senussi was in fact alive and well, living in Africa. Officials of Mauritania said Saturday that they had arrested Mr. Senussi debarking from a flight from Casablanca, Morocco, according to news reports. They said he was carrying a fake Malian passport. Many senior figures from the former Qaddafi government fled or attempted to flee over Libya’s porous southern border into other African nations. Colonel Qaddafi had cultivated close ties to the tribal groups that live on both sides of those borders. Three other members of the Qaddafi family who played less important roles in the government than Seif also escaped into neighboring countries. Colonel Qaddafi’s son Mohammed and daughter Aisha escaped into Algeria and are believed to remain there. His son Saadi is in Niger, effectively under house arrest.",

    "source": "A Boy Full of Quirks Learns to Curb His Aggression <eos> When Jaren Aponte, 4, wants to show someone affection, he seeks out an ear. “He has a specific tic,” his mother, Mary Viera, said. “He’ll grab somebody’s ear, rub it, and also rub his own ear. That’s him telling you ‘I like you.’ ” Jaren’s method of demonstrating fondness is not always understood, or reciprocated, by his classmates. If his grip is too tight or he tugs too hard, it causes physical irritation and reminds his mother of Jaren’s aggressive behavior, which has been curbed. At age 2, Jaren had yet to start speaking, showed weak motor skills and threw frequent tantrums. Ms. Viera, 41, who was armed with the knowledge she gained from rearing two other children — her daughter, Deileen Simmons, 24, and her son Jaden Arroyo, 9 — knew that something was wrong with him developmentally. Specialists concluded that Jaren had a sensory disorder, though no specific condition has been diagnosed. Ms. Viera started reading books about children with conditions similar to Jaren’s, and the more she learned, the more sense she was able to make of so many of her son’s quirky behaviors. “He gets overloaded,” she said. “The way he processes things is affected. It could be auditory, it could be visual, it could be smell. There are certain noises that he doesn’t like. He doesn’t like crowds.” Her son also has adverse reactions to touching certain things, like finger-paint and glue, and his sensitive taste buds have made him a picky eater. The biggest revelation from her research had been the connection between Jaren’s disorder and his aversion to public transportation. “My worst nightmare was getting on the bus or the train,” Ms. Viera said. “He would throw a tantrum from the moment we got on to the moment we got off.” She said that on numerous occasions, after she and her family had returned home from such a trip, she retreated to the bathroom to cry, in private, before composing herself. “When you have a child like this, you can do one thing to calm him down, or you can do 100 things that won’t calm him down,” she said. Since September 2011, Jaren has been enrolled in the Head Start Program at Public School 15, near his home in the Bronx. The program is financed by the Educational Alliance , a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. “His speech has gotten better,” Ms. Viera said. “Socially, he’s better. If he wanted a toy or if he had a toy and somebody wanted to take it, he’d threaten them with fists.” Now, she said, Jaren is learning how to interact better with others, and he takes his boxer’s stance less frequently. His special needs, including complications caused by his asthma, meant Ms. Viera, who used to work full time at the Children’s Place, a clothing store in Manhattan, had to reduce her schedule to 10 hours a week. Her monthly income is $355. She receives $600 a month in food stamps and about $750 a month from Jaren’s father, who lives with her and the children. In February 2012, after three years on the waiting list of the New York City Housing Authority, the family received housing, with a monthly rent of $752. Unable to afford a dresser and bed for Jaren, Ms. Viera contacted the Ed Alliance, which used $800 in Neediest Cases money to help her buy furniture. For herself, college is now on Ms. Viera’s radar; it is something she has often contemplated. Over the summer, she took college preparatory courses at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, and she hopes to attend the City University of New York. Her goal is to study early childhood education, inspired by the research she did to help her understand her son’s challenges. “I just got interested in going to school to help other kids,” she said. “There’s a lot of kids who have problems.” The pursuit of higher education might also prove to be a motivating distraction. “You have to be in my shoes to see what I go through every day,” she said. “It’s not easy. The only thing that gets me out of bed is saying: ‘If I’m not going to do it, who’s going to do it?’ ”",

    "source": "Uncertainty Clouds New Super Rugby Franchises <eos> WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Super Rugby’s bold new era is due to kick off in less than three months, but there is a growing concern that at least two of the new teams could be more of a liability than an asset to the new-look Southern Hemisphere competition. Next year the number of teams will increase to 18 from 15, with new teams in Argentina, Japan and South Africa joining the existing ones in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Argentina’s Los Jaguares have made steady progress in their efforts to be ready when the season starts Feb. 26. They have a stadium deal in place in Buenos Aires, and they unveiled their coaching staff Wednesday, with Raúl Pérez as head coach. Of the 30 players signed so far, 22 played for Argentina at the Rugby World Cup, including their inspirational captain, Agustín Creevy, who will have the same role for Los Jaguares. But while the Argentines are on track for a February start, the same cannot be said for Japan’s Sunwolves or the Southern Kings in South Africa. The Sunwolves, who will play home games in both Tokyo and Singapore, have stadiums lined up in both cities. And while the Sunwolves have the business side nailed down, they have not announced a single player signing with only 10 weeks to go. At least five of Japan’s World Cup stars — Fumiaki Tanaka (Highlanders), Michael Leitch (Chiefs), Male Sa’u (Blues), Hendrik Tui and Ayumu Goromaru (both Queensland Reds) — have chosen to play at other Super Rugby teams in New Zealand and Australia. The Sunwolves also have no coach. Japan’s former coach, Eddie Jones, walked away from the franchise to join the Stormers before taking the England job, while the former Australia coach Robbie Deans and ex-Canterbury and New Zealand Under-20s coach Rob Penney — both currently coaching in Japan’s Top League — have ruled themselves out of contention. Former Hurricanes coach Mark Hammett is the latest to be linked to the position . The delay of such a critical appointment as coach is causing consternation at Sanzar, the governing body that oversees Super Rugby. “The biggest worry is that they have yet to appoint a coach,” Steve Tew, the chief executive of the New Zealand Rugby Union, said this week. “We are told that will be resolved before Christmas, and clearly that’s already too late.” The Southern Kings, who played in Super Rugby in 2013 before they were replaced by the Lions franchise for 2014, are also drawing concerns. The South African Rugby Union took over the management of the cash-strapped franchise from the Eastern Province Rugby Union last month after players and staff were owed up to four months’ salary. Several players have walked out, with hooker Michael van Vuuren threatening court action over the unpaid wages, while the assistant coach Carlos Spencer also left. Coach Brent Janse van Rensburg quit two weeks after being appointed and was replaced by Deon Davids, who has no Super Rugby experience. An initial roster of 20 players was only announced last Sunday and contains just a few players who have played Super Rugby, including lock Steven Sykes, flyhalf Elgar Watts and prop Schalk Ferreira. Despite all that, Jurie Roux, the chief executive of S.A.R.U., is bullish about the progress made. “There has been a lot of overheated speculation about all manner of things, but we have not lost sight of our responsibility,” Roux said in a statement on Sunday. “Our only desire has been to rescue the Southern Kings from the parlous state in which they found themselves and put together a competitive squad to represent the people of the Eastern Cape with pride in Super Rugby.” But whatever progress Roux declares the Southern Kings have made, they and the Sunwolves are well behind the other teams, who have already begun work for the coming season, including strength and conditioning and strategy. Aside from the team problems, there are also fears that the complicated nature of the revamped competition will turn off fans. The new structure moves from a three-conference system of five teams per country to four conferences split into two unevenly sized groups. In the Australasian group, the Australian and New Zealand conferences will stay as they are, with five teams each. In the South Africa group, there will be two conferences of four teams each. In the first conference are the South African teams the Bulls, Stormers and Cheetahs, along with the Sunwolves. In the second, South African teams the Kings, Lions and Sharks are joined by Los Jaguares. The difference in conference size means different schedule setups for the four-team and five-team conferences. But all will play a 15-game schedule and have two bye weekends before the playoffs start with the quarterfinals in July. The final is scheduled for Aug. 6. The playoffs will include the four conference champions, the three next-highest-ranked teams from the Australasian group and the next highest-ranked team from the South Africa group. “We are faced with a competition structure that is not as simple as we would like,” admitted Tew. “But it is not as confusing as some people are making it out to be. I think once it gets under way, people will understand it better. “Clearly we do not need to throw any more travel into the mix, and we’ve got a limited window. I think we’ve done the best job we could given all those circumstances. “Is it perfect? Clearly not. Will we continue to work on it as it evolves? Yes.” Tew hopes the Jan. 1 arrival of the new Sanzar chief executive, Andy Marinos, will prevent similar problems during any future expansion. Marinos played Super Rugby and has held several positions in S.A.R.U., including most recently the post of general manager of commercial and marketing. This latest competition restructure was partly as a result of wanting to keep South Africa in Super Rugby, which meant agreeing to S.A.R.U. demands for a sixth team. “He will lead the conversations that we need to have to make sure any future expansion is part of a very carefully thought out strategic framework, which frankly we haven’t had in the past because we’ve kind of had to wait every five years for South Africa to recommit,” Tew said. “Not ideal, but that’s just the way it’s been.”",

    "source": "Ogden Mills Phipps: A King of the Sport He Helped Make Better <eos> Dinny Phipps was as much a part of the landscape of the Oklahoma training track at Saratoga Race Course as the oak trees that Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons planted nearly 100 years ago and continue to shade the family’s barn. Most August mornings, Phipps sat out front in a golf cart and talked horses with jockeys and exercise riders, clockers and fellow owners. Behind him, his grandchildren darted between and behind impeccably bred thoroughbreds, their moms and dads keeping a watchful but never worried eye on them. After all, they, too, had once treated the shedrow as their summer playground. The smell of bacon wafted from the kitchen that looked out on the courtyard. The morning usually ended there with three generations of Phippses sitting down for breakfast. When the family returns to its barn at the finest racetrack in America, a seat at that table will be empty and a big hole in the heart of American horse racing will be apparent. Ogden Mills Phipps died on Wednesday at 75. Dinny was as old school as his given name. His ancestors were attached to the Carnegie steel empire. The family’s Bessemer Trust, established with that original fortune, now manages more than $88 billion for some of the world’s wealthiest people. It was thoroughbreds, however, that quickened his blood. Phipps was a survivor of racing’s golden age, and one of things that he was most proud of was how his family had successfully handed down its love of horses through the generations. The Phippses have spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years following a blueprint that rewards patience. Image Orb gave Phipps his only Kentucky Derby win, in 2013. Credit David J. Phillip/Associated Press Dinny Phipps bred horses to race them — a shockingly quaint notion in an era when unproven colts and fillies are paraded through an auction ring and often fetch millions of dollars. He didn’t hurry still-developing 2-year-olds to the racetrack or retire his colts to stallion duty as soon as they won a couple of big races. Horses as old as 4 might run their first race in the family’s traditional black silks and cherry jockey cap and continue to run at 6 or 7. Phipps was a big man with a poker face and was given to laconic pronouncements. “Pigs get fed, hogs get slaughtered,” he often said about investing. “We are about the fillies: They provide consistency over generations,” he said of the family’s breeding strategy. But Phipps also was a warm conversationalist whose eyes twinkled when he told how, in the 1940s, when he was too young to be legally allowed on the racetrack, his father, Ogden, got him a seat on the starting gate at Saratoga every afternoon the family had a horse running. He also laughed at how his family’s mistakes remained part of thoroughbred racing lore. In 1936, Gladys Mills Phipps sold an underperforming 3-year-old who became a Depression-era hero by the name of Seabiscuit. In 1969, the family won a coin toss with Penny Chenery but chose to wait a year for a son or daughter of its Bold Ruler, passing up the chance to own Secretariat, the 1973 Triple Crown champion. Still, his family raised and raced champions in staggering numbers. Among them was the undefeated Personal Ensign, who caught the Kentucky Derby-winning filly Winning Colors at the wire of the 1988 Breeders’ Cup Distaff in her 13th and final race. He won his first and only Kentucky Derby in 2013 with a colt named Orb, who became dear to him not because he was ultra-accomplished, but, rather, because he was owned in partnership with his cousin Stuart Janney III and prompted an outpouring of good wishes from the public. “So many people were happy for us, and it has been very moving,” he said in the days after the race. The biggest legacy he left to the sport, however, was a result of his 32-year run as chairman of the Jockey Club, a company that started out as a breed registry, but one he transformed into a technology, media and research conglomerate. Its offshoots have poured tens of millions of dollars back into making the sport safer and more humane. It didn’t always make Phipps the most popular man in the sport, especially when he pushed for stricter drug rules and stiffer punishment for cheaters. It speaks to the sport’s fundamental problem that horse trainers and some owners vilified Phipps for wanting thoroughbreds to be drug-free and to be treated and cherished like the wonderful athletes that they are during their careers as well as after they left the track. “Quite simply, I see it as a way of giving back to a sport that has provided me with so much enjoyment,” he told the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities. “That was probably passed on to me from my dad, and I try to instill that sense of responsibility and commitment in my kids.” For Christmas, his daughter Daisy gave her father a wall hanging with halter plates featuring the names of the 50 Grade I winners who raced for the family stable. He was deeply moved and even more tickled that she had left room for the names of 22 future Grade I winners. His family clearly has accepted the challenge, and will continue to summer in Saratoga.",

    "source": "Swim-Off for Roster Spot Takes Toll on Teammates <eos> CHARLOTTE, N.C. — For nine months, Cullen Jones and Josh Schneider have been training side by side for a 22-second duel. Their 50-meter freestyle swim-off Thursday is the sport’s version of musical chairs: when the clock stops, one of them will not have a seat on the plane to the world championships in Shanghai. The race, which will take place at Mecklenburg County Aquatic Center on the first night of a USA Swimming Grand Prix meet, has drawn enormous interest in swimming circles, the buzz similar to the buildup for a boxing title bout. Seldom do swimmers, used to racing in heats of six or eight, compete head to head like gladiators in a ring. And rarely do such unique backgrounds converge in the pool. Jones and Schneider are teammates at SwimMAC Carolina but are otherwise as different as fresh and salt water. Jones, 27, is an Olympian and American record-holder with a wealth of racing experience. An African-American, he is used to being stared at on the pool deck because of the color of his skin. Schneider, 23, is a greenhorn who can almost count his total number of 50-meter long course races on both hands and toes. A former football player, he draws stares on the pool deck because of his inflated biceps. They have in common the edgy mien that separates sprinters from other swimmers, and as their high-stakes showdown draws nearer, the tension between them has gone from simmering to close to a full boil. Seven days before the race, Jones and Schneider were talking trash to each other at practice. “But they weren’t joking,” said another teammate, Nick Brunelli. “They meant it.” The swimmers’ coaches, David Marsh and Peter Verhoef, both described the situation as awkward. It is a real trial for Marsh, whose organizational oversight at the United States senior nationals last August set off the series of events that led to the swim-off. He neglected to scratch Schneider from the 100 butterfly, an event the swimmer had no intention of racing, which automatically disqualified Schneider from the 50 freestyle, the other event he was entered in that day. Schneider filed a protest and was allowed to compete in the 50. A race that requires laser focus because of its high technical difficulty took place under a cloud of confusion, with Jones and Schneider tying for second place, in 21.97, behind the winner, Nathan Adrian, at 21.70. Jones’s American record, set in 2009, is 21.40. A swim-off for the second and final world championship berth normally would have been held within days of the original race, but Schneider was sidelined after breaking his hand powering to the finish in his next event, the 100-meter freestyle. Jones agreed to a swim-off to save Schneider from having to go through a legal process to have his time validated, and the sprinters settled on the May showdown. The long buildup for the shortest of Olympic aquatic events has exacted a toll on both participants. “At this point it’s like, ‘Dude, let’s just get this over with,’ ” said Jones, who added, “There’s so much pressure, so much anxiety, because of the stakes and because it’s a teammate you’re having to race.” Jones spoke at the pool where the two will race. In an interview later in the day before a dry-land workout at a downtown Y.M.C.A., Schneider said, “I like the attention and I’m excited, but I’m ready for it to be over.” Their coaches lately have tried to defuse the tension by keeping Jones and Schneider apart whenever possible. On Friday, six days before the race, Schneider swam a tuneup race while Jones practiced in the water with the team. The next day, Jones competed in a tuneup race and Schneider swam at practice. “Unfortunately, it’s created a situation there where they each feel a certain dislike for the other person,” Verhoef said, adding, “Ideally, I’d like them to come out of this with a hungry attitude, a feeling of let’s get back to work and push each other to be the top two in the world.” Jones has been to the summit, winning an Olympic gold medal in 2008 as a member of the United States’ 400-meter freestyle relay. In the Olympic final in Beijing, he swam the third leg, giving way to Jason Lezak, whose amazing finish propelled the United States team to a world record and an upset of France in one of the most memorable races of the Games. Jones, who was born in the Bronx and raised in New Jersey, became the second African-American to hold or share a swimming world record. He lowered the American record in the 50 before the post-Olympic wave he was riding crashed. Last year he felt the pull of the world beyond the pool and found himself adrift. “I just kind of wanted to have that social life I never had,” he said. “At nationals last year, I didn’t feel like I was in the best shape. Tying with Josh was a big-time wake-up call.” Jones said he agreed to the swim-off out of a sense of fairness. “Josh and I did tie,” he said. “I feel like I paid my karma upfront.” At the Grand Prix meet here last year, Schneider edged Jones for his first significant long-course victory in the 50-meter freestyle. If Jones does not win the swim-off, he will lose a substantial amount of money from his sponsors, which include Nike. It already has cost him, Jones said, because he is paid less if he is not a member of the United States national A team, and that group is composed of those who have qualified for the world championships July 24 to 31. “When I made the decision it was ‘fair’s fair,’ ” Jones said. “But I won’t do it again.” He fell silent for a few seconds. “Yeah, I won’t do it again.” When Jones arrived on the national scene as a collegian at North Carolina State, he was hailed as a new breed of swimmer: a natural athlete who might have followed in the footsteps of his father, Roland, who played college basketball. Schneider represents swimming’s next archetype: the all-around great athlete who might have excelled in any sport. At Cincinnati’s Taylor High School, Schneider earned letters in swimming, track and field, golf and football, where he played at wide receiver and tight end. He won multiple Big East championship titles at the University of Cincinnati and added the N.C.A.A. crown in the 50-yard freestyle as a senior in 2010. “My freshman year of college,” Schneider said, “I said I think I’m done with swimming. I want to go back to football. Just talking to coaches and my family, I realized that’d be a dumb move. In football I’d most likely be a Joe Schmo. The reality of my getting to the N.F.L. is really slim. In swimming I feel like I can be in the Olympics.” Schneider said he took the same mentality to the starting blocks that he did to the line of scrimmage. “In the 50 free you have to dig deep into the innermost part of you and unlock that aggression and release it,” he said. “It’s like every down, hut-one, hut-two, go.” He came to SwimMAC Carolina last year as a 6-foot-4 piece of clay to be molded by Marsh and Verhoef, who have overhauled his stroke. Schneider is confident he will prevail in the swim-off. “I’ve put in a lot more work than Cullen has,” he said last week. “Because he misses practices. I just feel like I want it more.” Jones said he was confident his experience would prevail in the end. “Having someone who swims with me who watches what I do because I’m the older swimmer has made me more professional in a lot of ways,” he said, referring to Schneider. There can be only one winner Thursday, but Marsh sees an outcome benefiting both swimmers. “At the end of the day I think they’ll both be exponentially better for having gone through this experience,” he said, “assuming they use it to move forward.”",

    "source": "2 Baghdad Attacks Attributed to Teenagers Kill 11 Others <eos> BAGHDAD — Two suicide bombers described as teenagers carried out attacks Wednesday in suburban Baghdad as the prime minister went to the northern city of Mosul to encourage Iraqi soldiers fighting in a new offensive to rid that area of Sunni Islamic extremists. The Mosul operation follows two other offensives, in Basra and the Sadr City district of Baghdad, that the government has carried out in recent months; the other two offensives focused on Shiite militias. Iraqi and American security forces believe that Mosul is the last urban stronghold of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, which American intelligence says is a homegrown militant group led by foreigners. The Iraqi Army began the offensive over the weekend and is being aided by American troops. There has long been support in Mosul for the Sunni insurgency because many former members of Saddam Hussein’s security forces live there. “The goal of this operation is to clean Mosul of the terrorist and criminal groups,” said Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who was accompanied by the ministers of interior and defense. “The operation will open a new page for civilians in Mosul, and the security forces should do everything to make this operation successful just as they are doing in Baghdad and Basra.” Basra has recently settled into relative calm, although it remains unclear if the Shiite militias are finished fighting or simply planning to resume the battle later. Clashes are still going on in Sadr City, although the past few days have been quieter since a cease-fire agreement was reached. The more damaging of the suicide bomb attacks on Wednesday occurred west of Baghdad about 5 p.m. in Abu Ghraib. It killed at least 10 people and wounded 50, some of them seriously, according to spokesmen for the Falluja and Jordanian hospitals, both in Falluja. By nightfall mosques in Falluja were calling people to donate blood, and police cars were ferrying donors to the hospitals. The bomber’s victims had been mourning the death of Taha al-Zobaie, who was killed two days ago, said Abu Mustapha, a relative who had shrapnel wounds and who would give only his nickname. The Zobaie tribe has opposed Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. “He was a child about 15 years old, and he was crying,” Abu Mustapha said, describing the bomber. “I don’t think he exploded himself because I did not see him move his hands. I think someone exploded him by remote control.” The suicide bomb attack south of Baghdad occurred near Yusufiya, a town that was once heavily dominated by extremists connected to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. The bomber, who was female, killed an Iraqi Army captain and wounded seven Iraqi soldiers, the American military said. Iraqis in the area described the bomber as being 8 to 12 years old, but an American military spokesman said the bomber appeared to be 16 to 18 years old. The bomber waited four hours for the captain to return to the company’s headquarters, telling soldiers there that she needed to talk to him, according to an Iraqi officer who was in the same brigade as the captain. He said Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia had put a price on the captain’s head. In Baghdad, the convoy of one of the leaders of the Iraqi Islamic Party was attacked by a car bomb in the predominantly Sunni neighborhood of Yarmouk. The leader, Ayad al-Sammaraie, was not in the convoy, but three of his bodyguards were killed and 23 people were wounded, according to the Ministry of Interior. Marine Charged in Iraq Shooting CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (AP) — Camp Pendleton’s commanding general has ordered a marine to be tried for murder in the killing of an unarmed detainee in Falluja, Iraq. Sgt. Jermaine Nelson, of New York, is among three marines accused of shooting unarmed captives in November 2004. Sergeant Nelsa, 26, is charged with unpremeditated murder and dereliction of duty. He told investigators in March 2007 that his squad leader had demanded help shooting four detainees after guns were found in the house where the Iraqis were held. Sergeant Nelson’s attorney, Joseph Low, has said he obeyed what he perceived as an order. Sergeant Nelson faces life in prison if convicted.",

    "source": "Drug Makers Raising Prices Before Reform <eos> Even as drug makers promise to support Washington’s health care overhaul by shaving $8 billion a year off the nation’s drug costs after the legislation takes effect, the industry has been raising its prices at the fastest rate in years. In the last year, the industry has raised the wholesale prices of brand-name prescription drugs by about 9 percent, according to industry analysts. That will add more than $10 billion to the nation’s drug bill, which is on track to exceed $300 billion this year. By at least one analysis, it is the highest annual rate of inflation for drug prices since 1992. The drug trend is distinctly at odds with the direction of the Consumer Price Index , which has fallen by 1.3 percent in the last year. Drug makers say they have valid business reasons for the price increases. Critics say the industry is trying to establish a higher price base before Congress passes legislation that tries to curb drug spending in coming years. “When we have major legislation anticipated, we see a run-up in price increases,” says Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota . He has analyzed drug pricing for AARP , the advocacy group for seniors that supports the House health care legislation that the drug industry opposes. A Harvard health economist, Joseph P. Newhouse, said he found a similar pattern of unusual price increases after Congress added drug benefits to Medicare a few years ago, giving tens of millions of older Americans federally subsidized drug insurance . Just as the program was taking effect in 2006, the drug industry raised prices by the widest margin in a half-dozen years. “They try to maximize their profits,” Mr. Newhouse said. But drug companies say they are having to raise prices to maintain the profits necessary to invest in research and development of new drugs as the patents on many of their most popular drugs are set to expire over the next few years. “Price adjustments for our products have no connection to health care reform ,” said Ron Rogers, a spokesman for Merck , which raised its prices about 8.9 percent in the last year, according to a stock analyst’s report. This year’s increases mean the average annual cost for a brand-name prescription drug that is taken daily would be more than $2,000 — $200 higher than last year, Professor Schondelmeyer said. And this means that the cost of many popular drugs has risen even faster. Merck, for example, now sells daily 10-milligram pills of Singulair, the blockbuster asthma drug, at a wholesale price of $1,330 a year — $147 more than last year. Singulair is now selling at retail, on drugstore.com , for nearly $1,478 a year. The drug companies “can charge what they want — it’s not fair,” Eric White, the 42-year-old owner of a small jewelry store in Queens , said as he left a pharmacy recently. Despite having drug insurance, Mr. White says he now pays $110 a month out of pocket for two brand-name allergy medicines, even as he has cut prices in his jewelry store by at least 40 percent to keep customers coming through the door. He shook his head. “What can I do?” he said. “I need my medicines.” The drug industry has actively opposed some of the cost-cutting provisions in the House legislation, which passed Nov. 7 and aims to cut drug spending by about $14 billion a year over a decade. But the drug makers have been proudly citing the agreement they reached with the White House and the Senate Finance Committee chairman to trim $8 billion a year — $80 billion over 10 years — from the nation’s drug bill by giving rebates to older Americans and the government. That provision is likely to be part of the legislation that will reach the Senate floor in coming weeks. But this year’s price increases would effectively cancel out the savings from at least the first year of the Senate Finance agreement. And some critics say the surge in drug prices could change the dynamics of the entire 10-year deal. “It makes it much easier for the drug companies to pony up the $80 billion because they’ll be making more money,” said Steven D. Findlay, senior health care analyst with the advocacy group Consumers Union . Name-brand prices have risen even as prices of widely used generic drugs have fallen by about 9 percent in the last year, Professor Schondelmeyer said. But name brands account for 78 percent of total prescription drug spending in this country. And as long as a name-brand drug still has patent protection it faces no price competition from generics. Ken Johnson , senior vice president of the industry association — the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America — criticized the analysis Professor Schondelmeyer had conducted for AARP, saying it was politically motivated. “In AARP’s skewed view of the world, medicines are always looked at as a cost and never seen as a savings — even though medicines often reduce unnecessary hospitalization, help avoid costly medical procedures and increase productivity through better prevention and management of chronic diseases,” he said. But Professor Schondelmeyer’s analysis — which found prices for the name-brand drugs most widely used by the Medicare population rising by 9.3 percent in the last year, the fastest rate since 1992 — is in line with the findings of a leading Wall Street analyst, too. The report was released on Monday. Catherine J. Arnold, a drug industry analyst at Credit Suisse , said her latest study of the nation’s eight biggest pharmaceutical companies showed markedly similar results: list prices rising an average of 8.7 percent in the 12 months ending Sept. 30 — the highest rate of growth since at least 2004. As does Professor Schondelmeyer, Ms. Arnold based her price calculations on reported wholesale prices and a formula that puts more emphasis on each company’s best-selling drugs. Ms. Arnold said the prospect of cost containment under health care reform, as well as the tougher business environment, entered into the decisions of manufacturers to raise prices this year. The industry stands to gain about 30 million customers with drug insurance from the legislation pending in Congress. But the industry also faces the prospect of tougher negotiations from both public and private buyers as the government tries to squeeze savings out of the health system. “If you’re going to take price increases,” Ms. Arnold said, “here and now might be the place to do that, because the next year and the year after that might be tough.” Mr. Johnson did not dispute the Credit Suisse study or deny Ms. Arnold’s finding that American drug makers have raised prices at the fastest rate in five years. He said both studies were incomplete by failing to include rebates that drug makers give distributors. But Ms. Arnold, Professor Schondelmeyer and a 2007 Congressional study of Medicare said the rebates often accrue to the middlemen, not consumers, and higher manufacturer prices lead to higher retail prices. And the drug industry’s own major consulting firm, IMS Health , has also reported a significant run-up in prices. Back in April, IMS predicted that United States drug sales might actually decline this year. Billy Tauzin , president of the industry’s trade association, highlighted the gloomy prediction in a June 1 letter to President Obama shortly before striking the deal to cut drug costs by $80 billion. In negotiating the deal, the drug makers argued that they could not afford to give up more than that. But in October, IMS made an unusual change in the middle of its forecasting cycle, saying it now believed United States sales would grow at least 4.5 percent in 2009 — or $21 billion more than expected six months earlier. A major reason, IMS said, was higher-than-expected price increases for drugs in the United States.",

    "source": "The Rangers’ Normally Stingy Defense Rests <eos> WASHINGTON — The Rangers ’ wild 5-4 overtime loss Wednesday night to the Capitals would have been stunning even if the Rangers had not beaten the Devils, 1-0, three days earlier. The Rangers, who have treated goals like rare gold bars this season, twice battled back from third-period deficits against the Capitals, only to watch their typically stingy defense get shredded by an even more impressive display of offense by Washington. And for one last slice of agony, the Capitals won a game of two-on-one rushes, with the best one of all in overtime. Defenseman Mike Green raced up the ice after a Rangers turnover and fired the winner past Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist with 1 minute 19 seconds left. “It was a very entertaining game,” Washington goalie Olaf Kolzig said. “The only thing missing was a shootout.” This was enough of a shootout for the Rangers’ tastes. They have given up as many as five goals only twice this season. “That’s a team that can score goals,” Rangers center Scott Gomez said. “We did what we had to do. We don’t want to give up five goals a game and leave Hank out there to dry, but we’ll take the point. We’ve got to work on some stuff. We were way too sloppy. And that was everyone.” The Rangers (16-12-3) suffered their fourth loss in the last five games, a stretch that makes the victory over the Devils on Sunday seem like an anomaly. The Capitals, meanwhile, have enjoyed a resurgence since firing Glen Hanlon as coach Nov. 22. They have lifted their record to 12-17-2, going 6-3-1 since Bruce Boudreau took over. In the first two meetings this season, both losses, the Capitals managed only one goal against the Rangers. But by the end of the second period Wednesday, they had two goals by forward Joe Motzko, who was playing in Hershey, Pa., last week. “I’m just happy to get on the board any way I can,” said Motzko, who had scored only one previous goal in the N.H.L. and has spent most of this season in the minors. “It’s a special night for me.” The Rangers started the game by taking a 2-0 lead in the first on goals by Gomez and forward Martin Straka. But the Capitals got one back in the first on Motzko’s first goal. From there, the Capitals built on their momentum. Motzko scored again in the second and the star forward Alex Ovechkin scored off a deflection of a shot by Green to take a 3-2 lead early in the third. The Rangers tied the score at 3-3 with Straka’s second goal, but the Capitals scored almost immediately on a long shot by defenseman Jeff Schultz. The Rangers tied the score again on a goal by Brendan Shanahan at 12:43 of the third. When the game went to overtime, the Rangers earned a point, but it was little consolation. “We weren’t very smart,” Rangers Coach Tom Renney said. “We handled the puck poorly, we managed it poorly. We had disjointed line changes, we had defensemen caught out for two-minute shifts because we couldn’t get out of our end. We weren’t very bright tonight.” The final indignity came when Shanahan got his skate stuck in a rut and fell while taking a pass from center Chris Drury in the Capitals’ zone. Washington center Brooks Laich collected the puck and set off on the game-winning two-on-one. “We weren’t happy with some of the chances we gave up when we had full control in our end,” Shanahan said. “We turned the puck over, and that’s the way it ended up in our net.” The nets had an awfully busy night. SLAP SHOTS The Rangers made defenseman Marek Malik a healthy scratch. ...Capitals center Michael Nylander, who played the last two seasons for the Rangers, missed the game, his third in a row, with an injury the Capitals have refused to describe. They said he could return early next week.",

    "source": "European Students’ Use of ‘Smart Drugs’ Is Said to Rise <eos> PARIS — Under heavy pressure to excel, significant numbers of European university students are using cognitive enhancers, so-called smart drugs, to keep up with academic demands, recent studies show. A lack of long-term research makes it difficult to gauge whether the use of such stimulants, with the aim of improving concentration and memory, is on the rise — and if so, to what degree — says Boris Quednow, an assistant professor and psychologist at the Psychiatric Hospital of the University of Zurich. “As no longitudinal data has been produced yet, we do not know if there really is an overall increase” in smart drug use, Mr. Quednow said in an interview. “However, it is my impression from discussions with students over the last years that consumption has likely increased.” Student drug use for recreational purposes is nothing new. But substance use for competitive purposes is another matter. A Swiss study published last November, based on a survey of 6,275 students at universities in Zurich and Basel between December 2012 and January 2013, found that one in seven reported using some form of neuro- or cognitive enhancer in the months leading up to their exams. In May this year a survey carried out by a national British student newspaper, The Tab, found that one in five students reported having used Modafinil, a medically approved treatment for narcolepsy and other sleep disorders, to increase their wakefulness while studying for their exams. In an interview, an undergraduate at the University of Geneva, who asked to be identified only as Andrea to protect herself against possible disciplinary action, said she had used smart drugs to keep up with her revision work — and with other students who were using them. “You are competing with students on smart drugs who are smarter than you anyway,” Andrea said. “You almost need to take them to be on a level playing field.” The difficulty of tracking the scale of use is compounded by the absence of any official, commonly accepted definition of cognitive enhancers. Larissa Maier, one of the authors of the Swiss study, said it aimed to survey “the use of prescription drugs, illegal drugs, or alcohol for the purpose of cognitive performance enhancement or for the purpose of increased psychological well-being in academic or work-related contexts.” Students from the universities of Zurich, Basel and ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, were questioned on their knowledge and use of substances to enhance mood or cognitive function. The data obtained showed that 13.8 percent of respondents had used some form of cognitive enhancement in the months leading to their exams. Substances used, the study found, included alcohol, the most commonly reported, by 5.6 percent of respondents; methylphenidate — sold under several trade names, including Ritalin — reported by 4.1 percent; sedatives (2.7 percent); beta blockers (1.2 percent); cannabis (2.5 percent); amphetamines (0.4 percent), and cocaine (0.2 percent). The lack of an agreed and shared definition makes it difficult to compare data internationally — the inclusion of alcohol in the Swiss study for example differentiates it from most American and British studies. Excluding alcohol would cut the headline figure in the Swiss survey to about 8 percent from nearly 14 percent. Still, the study stirred an ethical and medical debate about academic doping. The short term negative effects of most drugs used for cognitive enhancement have been widely studied. Side effects may include insomnia, anxiety, sleeping disorders, headaches, restlessness, cardiac arrhythmia, irritability, aggressive behavior and psychosis. There may also be a risk of dependency. To date, however, scientific data is lacking on their long-term effects on cognitive skills. “Currently there are still no long term studies of the effects of ‘smart drugs’ on healthy people” said Barbara Sahakian, professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Cambridge. “We know the brain continues to develop, what we do not know is how prolonged use of cognitive enhancers affects the chemicals in the brain.” If smart drug use is growing, that may be at least partly a result of their wide availability on the Internet, with online distributors offering 100 milligram and 200 milligram Modafinil tablets at prices ranging from under $1 to a few dollars each, depending on quantity and manufacturer. The Internet may also be partly responsible for increased use in another way, contributing to an information overload that raises student stress levels, Ms. Maier suggested. “The development of the media and Internet offers new ways of learning and new options for research,” she said. “From an abundance of information, students need to learn to focus on the essentials. This uncertainty regarding the required knowledge leads, together with high time pressure, to a helplessness which some students try to overcome with neuroenhancement.” For his part, Mr. Quednow said he placed some responsibility on media coverage of the issue. “The media hype around this topic is complicit in the growing use of cognitive enhancers, as many newspaper articles suggest that they might be effective,” he said. In fact, that effectiveness is by no means proved. “A ‘smart drug,’ which actually makes people smarter and has no side effects, does not yet exist” Ms. Maier said. Ethical issues surrounding the use of smart drugs are as complicated as the medical ones, with some students and professors arguing that their use by healthy individuals amounts to a form of cheating, and advocating the introduction of mandatory pre-exam drug tests. At Paris Descartes University, a first year medical student who gave his name only as Thomas and asked not to be identified because of peer group pressures, criticized the use of smart drugs by some other students on his course. “If someone on smart drugs gets a better grade it does not mean that they are naturally smarter, but that they are able to not sleep and hence revise more,” he said. “Their decreased need for sleep makes them superior to others, and thus gives them an unfair advantage.” Yet some researchers say that the use of cognitive enhancers does not necessarily benefit learning. “An increase in performance of a specific cognitive domain after the use of prescription drugs in healthy individuals often goes along with a decrease in performance of other cognitive domains,” Ms. Maier noted. Mr. Quednow agreed. “It has been consistently shown that the improvement of focused attention and working memory normally goes along with a decrease of flexible attention and long-term memory,” he said. “Thus, stimulants are less useful for learning or for complex tasks which require flexible adaptation.” Still, that message carries little weight with a generation heading into a European job market where youth unemployment is stubbornly over 20 percent. “Using smart drugs is not a habit — it is doing what you need to do to get the work done,” said Andrea, the Geneva university student. “The universities want results,” she said, “so the ends justify the means.”",

    "source": "Revival by Steven Stamkos Puts Lightning in East Finals <eos> TAMPA, Fla. — So much for all those questions about what has happened to Steven Stamkos in the N.H.L. playoffs. Stamkos, a two-time Maurice Richard Trophy winner, and the Tampa Bay Lightning are headed to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in four years after Tuesday night’s 4-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens ended their second-round series in six games. Stamkos failed to score in Tampa Bay’s opening-round matchup against Detroit. He had three goals against the Canadiens, who fought off elimination in Games 4 and 5. The Lightning will face the Rangers, who defeated the Washington Capitals, 2-1, in overtime in Game 7 of their second-round series on Wednesday night. The Lightning are one stage away from the Stanley Cup final for the first time since 2011, when they lost to the Boston Bruins in seven games. Tampa Bay won its only title in 2004. “It’s exciting,” Stamkos said. “I’ve always talked about 2011 was the most fun I’ve ever had playing this game. We’re getting right on that right now. Obviously, I want a little better result this time.” After watching Tampa Bay’s series lead shrink to 3-2, Stamkos urged his teammates to not play scared in Game 6. The Lightning responded with their best game of the series, and maybe of the playoffs. “We were talking about this game like it was Game 7,” Stamkos said. “We clogged it up good in the third period. It was as good a defensive period as we’ve played.” Of the five Canadian-based teams in the postseason, Montreal was the last to be eliminated. The Canadiens, in 1993, were the last team from Canada to win the Cup. Nikita Kucherov had two goals and an assist for Tampa Bay on Tuesday, finishing with six goals in the series. Ondrej Palat had a goal and an assist in the clincher, while Ben Bishop stopped 18 shots to outperform Montreal goaltender Carey Price. “Our goalie continues to step up in big situations,” Lightning Coach Jon Cooper said. “The longer the series goes, Ben just gets better and better.” The Lightning finished the Canadiens despite playing without forward Ryan Callahan, who had an emergency appendectomy on Monday night. Cooper has not ruled a playoff return by Callahan. “We miss him out there for sure, but we had his name up on the board before the game as a little inspiration,” Stamkos said. Tampa Bay is headed to the conference finals just a year after being swept by Montreal in the opening round. “Last year, we were a young group; I think half the team didn’t play a playoff game” before facing the Canadiens, Kucherov said. “This year we are more mature, and we have more confidence.”",

    "source": "Building Schools Out of Clicks, Not Bricks <eos> CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND — This past year has been a time of signs and wonders for the open educational resources movement, which pushes for free public access to educational materials. The first sign came from California, where a Stanford professor, Sebastian Thrun , decided to offer his introductory course in artificial intelligence for free online. Thanks in part to an article in The New York Times, enrollment for the class topped 160,000. And suddenly a movement that had spent a decade struggling to get the world’s attention found itself at the top of policy agendas. Unesco began its own open resources platform in November. In the United States, support is building for moves to require the recipients of public funds to make their research freely available. Governments around the world began to realize that it was cheaper to invest in “clicks instead of bricks.” The phrase was coined by John Daniel, a keynote speaker at the movement’s annual conference at Queens College Cambridge last week, in an atmosphere that at times seemed more like a revival meeting than a sober gathering of academics from 21 countries. Eko Indrajit from Indonesia explained that in a country with 19 million people of college age but where the universities can only accommodate 5 million — and where there are only 3,000 Ph.D.’s in the entire country — putting the best courses on the Internet was the quickest way to expand capacity without sacrificing quality. “We don’t believe in invisible hands,” Dr. Indrajit said. “We believe that success can be designed.” One theme heard repeatedly during the three-day meeting was the opportunity created by the world financial crisis. Cable Green, director of global learning at Creative Commons , said that policy at the state level in the United States was swinging decisively in favor of open access partly because of the skyrocketing cost of textbooks. “Textbooks cost more than tuition in many community colleges,” he said. “That can’t be right.” “Digital technology makes sharing a lot easier and cheaper,” said Nick Pearce of Durham University in Britain. Dr. Pearce, who teaches an anthropology course he described as “Sex, Death and Monkeys,” cited the rapid growth of the Pinterest Web site as an example of “the way social media allows you to treat ideas as objects.” Although initially favored by young women for sharing photos and fashion ideas, the site, which now ranks third in popularity behind Facebook and Twitter, is starting to be used in education, he said. A decade ago there were only a handful of courses available online — all of them from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Today there are more than 21,000, with more being added every week, according to Anka Mulder, president of the Open Course Ware Consortium , which hosted the conference along with Open University in Britain. “We are now on every continent except Antarctica,” she said, adding that students everywhere now live in a digital world. “My kids meet their friends online just as easily as their friends around the corner. But it has to become a lot easier, and more interesting, for students to meet online.” “At first a lot of professors didn’t trust virtual education,” said Sergio Martinez, from the University of Cantabria . With 120 courses now online, the university, though one of the smallest in Spain, gets more than 96,000 visitors a month to its Web site from all over the Spanish-speaking world. The international reach of the movement was underlined by Dr. Daniel, who said that initial concerns that the traffic would all be from richer countries to poorer ones have not been borne out. “Instead we see a course on tropical medicine from Nkrumah University in Ghana being adapted by the University of Michigan,” he said in an interview after his speech. Bakary Diallo, rector of the African Virtual University , based in Nairobi, said that when his institution began in 1997 “we hoped that African countries would take up our material.” That has indeed happened, but of the 197 countries where his students live, “Brazil is the first country, and the U.S.A. is the second.” The university, which offers a blend of online and face-to-face teaching, produces courses in English, French and Portuguese, and recently received a $15.6 million grant from the African Development Bank to expand its operations. Yet its education foundation course for teachers “is incredibly popular in Brazil. We don’t understand why,” Dr. Diallo said. Although the delegates were united in their enthusiasm for the future of online learning, there were sharp divisions around issues like the future of teaching, copyright, private education providers and the importance of credentials and university credits in motivating and rewarding students. “You don’t need a teacher for learning,” said Rory McGreal from Athabasca, the Canadian open university, arguing that most teachers “learn a lot on their own.” Rebecca Kahn from Peer2Peer University , which “organizes learning outside of institutional walls,” said her organization was “never going to have a school of medicine. We’re never going to have a school of engineering. But we can do some things better than a traditional university. We can adapt faster.” The role of open resources in enabling universities to adapt was the message of Steve Carson from M.I.T. Traditionally, universities performed three functions, he said: “providing content to students, learning activities, and assessment and certification.” The Internet’s ability to provide more and better content faster and more cheaply meant these functions “have become disaggregated,” Mr. Carson said. But he suggested they may be about to come back together in a different form. The issue of credentials, which was hardly on the agenda a few years ago, now surfaced in numerous discussions. Peer2Peer offers what it calls “digital badges” for completed work, while M.I.T.’s MITx Web site awards online “certificates”; but neither give out credit or degrees. However, credits can be earned through the online OER University , while the State University of New York’s Empire State College offers credit for prior learning. “It’s nice to talk about education for everyone, but the need for degrees still exists,” said Ellen Murphy of the State University of New York . The lack of agreement did not bother Mary Lou Forward, executive director of the Open Course Ware Consortium. “This is a very collaborative movement,” she said. “Open means open. There’s room at the table for all players.”",

    "source": "Climate Pact Is Signed by 3 States and a Partner <eos> The leaders of three Pacific Coast states and British Columbia have announced a broad alliance to combat climate change, including new joint steps to raise the cost of greenhouse gas pollution, promote zero-emission vehicles and push for the use of cleaner-burning fuels in transportation. The governors of California, Oregon and Washington and the premier of British Columbia said the compact could simultaneously reduce carbon emissions and create new clean-energy jobs in a region of 53 million people that is equivalent to the fifth-largest economy in the world. But while California and British Columbia have already taken steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it was unclear whether legislatures in Oregon and Washington could be persuaded to endorse the plan. Legislators in both states refused in 2009 to approve market-based plans to reduce carbon pollution. Meeting in San Francisco on Monday, the three governors and British Columbia’s environment minister pledged to harmonize their existing targets to reduce carbon pollution by 2050. The governors of Oregon and Washington said they would work toward setting limits on carbon in fuels; California has already done so. Other initiatives in the pact would further integrate the region’s electricity grid, standardize energy-efficiency requirements for appliances and streamline the approval of clean-energy projects. Carrying out those and other steps in the region, with its $2.8 trillion annual economy, could lead industries to adopt them nationwide, said Ellen Hanak, an economist and senior fellow at the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. California’s fuel-efficiency standards, for example, have largely been adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency nationwide. Automakers are already selling vehicles nationally with fuel-saving technologies developed for California’s vast market, she said. “Our generation has an opportunity to lead on the world stage,” said British Columbia’s premier, Christy Clark, who spoke via a broadcast link from Victoria. “This agreement signals we are ready to innovate and work together to achieve a healthy, strong and secure future.” California already mandates a 10 percent reduction by 2020 in the carbon content of fuels like diesel and gasoline, which account for more than two-fifths of the state’s greenhouse gas pollution. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently upheld the legality of the standard, part of climate-change legislation that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger promoted in 2007. California also has a cap-and-trade program in which major businesses, utilities, and oil and natural gas suppliers whose carbon-dioxide emissions exceed set levels have to buy emissions rights from those who emit less. British Columbia taxes carbon pollution. But Oregon and Washington’s Democratic governors are likely to find it tougher to enact similar measures. The Senates in both states are narrowly split between Democrats and Republicans, who have generally opposed carbon-reduction measures as too costly to consumers and burdensome for businesses. Some rural- and suburban-district Democrats have been skittish about supporting them as well, said William Lunch, a political science professor at Oregon State University. “If it requires legislative approval, it’s not inconceivable,” he said, referring to carbon-reduction initiatives, “as long as it’s not defined as involving revenue increases.” Anything else, he said, “is not going to happen.” Washington’s governor, Jay Inslee, has convened a bipartisan group of legislators to work on climate-change measures and favors California-style curbs on carbon-dioxide emissions. Oregon’s governor, John Kitzhaber, has endorsed placing a price on carbon emissions, but his 10-year energy strategy, released last December, did not mention such programs.",

    "source": "AT&T Fourth-Quarter Earnings Hurt by Pensions and Storm <eos> Over the holiday season, AT&T sold a record number of smartphones. But its quarterly earnings took a hit from pension costs and Hurricane Sandy. Despite the setbacks, AT&T’s business had a strong fourth quarter. It sold more smartphones than its main competitor, Verizon Wireless. It also added many new contract subscribers and increased the revenue that it gets from mobile data, the fees that people pay to use the Internet on its network. “We had an excellent 2012,” said Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive, in a statement. “Looking ahead,” he added, “our key growth platforms — mobile data, U-verse and strategic business services — all have good momentum with a lot of headroom.” On Thursday, AT&T reported a loss in the fourth quarter of $3.9 billion, or 68 cents a share, up from a loss of $6.7 billion, or $1.12 a share, from the same quarter a year earlier. The company said revenue was essentially flat at $32.6 billion. Its adjusted per-share earnings were 44 cents a share, excluding pension costs, the impact of Hurricane Sandy and the sale of its advertising units. Wall Street analysts had expected 45 cents a share on earnings of $32.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. The company, based in Dallas, said that it sold 10.2 million smartphones over the quarter, the most ever sold by any American carrier. A majority of those smartphones were iPhones: AT&T sold 8.6 million iPhones, in contrast to Verizon Wireless’s 6.2 million iPhones. AT&T did not, however, beat Verizon in an important metric for carriers: the number of new contract subscribers, who are the most valuable type of customer. AT&T gained 780,000 new contract subscribers over the quarter, compared with Verizon’s 2.1 million. In the wireless industry, subscription growth is crucial as carriers joust for the few remaining people who do not already own cellphones. Image AT&T reported a fourth-quarter loss of $3.9 billion, up from $6.7 billion a year before, on flat revenue of $32.6 billion. Credit Matt Rourke/Associated Press The iPhone, the most popular smartphone in the world, has been an important weapon for carriers to get new subscribers. Although AT&T still leads as the nation’s top seller of iPhones, Verizon has been increasing its iPhone sales every quarter, and it is getting close to catching up, said Chetan Sharma, an independent mobile analyst. “There’s always been this attachment in consumers’ minds that AT&T is the brand for iPhone,” Mr. Sharma said. “I think that’s starting to even out in the marketplace.” Similar to Verizon, AT&T last summer started offering shared data plans , which allow customers to share a single pool of data across multiple devices, including smartphones, tablets and computers. It said on the earnings call that it already had 6.6 million subscribers on these plans, about a quarter of whom are opting for plans with at least 10 gigabytes. Thanks in part to these new shared data plans, revenue from mobile data grew 14.7 percent over the quarter, to $6.8 billion, up from $5.9 billion last year. AT&T’s success with shared data plans is good news for the company, because they help to pry customers off flat-rate, unlimited data plans so that they eventually pay more for data, said Jan Dawson, an analyst with Ovum, a research firm. Indeed, AT&T said more than 15 percent of shared data plan customers were switching from unlimited data plans. AT&T also saw a rise in customers for U-verse, its digital phone, television and high-speed Internet service for households. It added 609,000 U-verse customers over the quarter, bringing the total number of subscribers to about 7.7 million. The carrier has big plans this year to attract more customers. It is in the process of a major wireless network expansion . It said late last year that it would invest an extra $14 billion to expand its wireless and broadband services through 2015. It expects that its fourth-generation network technology, called LTE, will cover 300 million people by the end of next year. Beyond making upgrades to its wireless network, AT&T has plans to offer new services that might create new revenue streams. In March, it will begin selling its new wireless home security system, Digital Life, which will allow people to use tablets or phones to monitor their homes from afar. If a burglar trips a motion sensor in the house, for example, a user can receive a text message, then call the police. Ralph de la Vega, chief executive of AT&T Mobility, has said that he believes home security will be a big opportunity to increase revenue, because only 20 percent of American homes have security systems, leaving millions of homeowners as potential buyers. AT&T’s Mr. Stephenson said he was excited about the “vibrant options” for phones set to arrive in the coming year, including devices with Research in Motion’s new BlackBerry 10 system . “I’m very optimistic about BlackBerry 10,” Mr. Stephenson said. “I hope that it’s as good as it appears to be.”",

    "source": "Lawmakers to Consider E.U.-Wide Consumer Code <eos> BERLIN — The European Commission will introduce a proposal Tuesday to streamline consumer sales rules and protections across the 27-nation bloc, which supporters say could generate €26 billion a year in new cross-border sales. The commissioner who will make the proposal, Viviane Reding, said a common sales law would eliminate buyer uncertainty and unnecessary legal costs for merchants, who typically spend €10,000 or more to adapt their sales contracts to each E.U. country’s national laws. The guidelines would be optional. Both the consumer and the merchant would have to choose to make the transaction under the code instead of a country’s existing rules. “The optional Common European Sales Law will help kick-start the single market, Europe’s engine for economic growth,” Mrs. Reding said in a statement provided by her office. “It will provide firms with an easy and cheap way to expand their business to new markets in Europe while giving consumers better deals and a high level of protection.” The proposal, which requires approval from the European Parliament and Council of Ministers, has generated controversy in Brussels, where a coalition of national consumer groups and legal societies, which advise businesses and consumers on the vagaries of national laws, has formed to block the proposal. Ursula Pachl, the deputy director general of the European Consumers’ Organization, a group in Brussels representing national and local consumer associations, said an optional sales contract could undermine pro-consumer legal regimes that are already in place in much of Scandinavia and in countries like Britain and Portugal. Ms. Pachl, who is an E.U. contract lawyer, said her organization was concerned that the proposed protections would be watered down in the legislative process, even excising the provision that allows consumers to opt out of the contract. “Businesses will be discouraged from using the new, tougher, stringent requirements because of extra costs,” to adapt to the new regulations, Ms. Pachl said during an interview. “The protections will never reach out to consumers because businesses won’t choose to apply it. To make it attractive to businesses, they will lower the standard and undercut existing consumer rights.” The harmonized sales contract would be available to European businesses and also to merchants from the United States and elsewhere doing business with E.U. customers. The proposal has attracted an array of supporters, including large European companies like Nokia, and groups like Britain’s Federation of Small Businesses. On June 8, the European Parliament voted 521 to 145, with eight abstentions, in favor of a nonbinding resolution supporting an optional, E.U.-wide contract regime. Poland, which holds the E.U.’s revolving presidency through December, has made the proposal one of its priorities. Mrs. Reding plans to present her proposal, the details of which were obtained by the International Herald Tribune, on Tuesday after the measure has been translated into the Union’s 23 official languages. She will also present the results of a commission survey suggesting that 73 percent of E.U. businesses are willing to use a common sales contract. Consumer contract laws in the European Union differ from country to country, with individual members applying their own rules to issues like product returns, refunds and exchanges. Those differences, and the costs of overcoming them, have limited cross-border trade primarily to multinational companies with the legal staffs to negotiate the maze, Mrs. Reding has argued. In Europe last year, three million consumers attempted to buy products in the Union but were refused because merchants were unwilling to sell outside of their domestic markets, the commission said. In the commission survey, two-thirds of consumers said they avoided cross-border purchases because they believed foreign laws were too weak. In 2010, only 9.3 percent of E.U. businesses sold products across the internal borders of the bloc, the commission said. In submissions to the commission this year, Nokia testified that its costs of clarifying legal questions for selling products or services in individual E.U. countries varied from “a few thousand euros to several tens of thousands of euros or more,” depending on the complexities of the issues involved. “With a common sales law, Nokia could launch its consumer-targeted online activities more quickly and at a lower cost,” according to Nokia’s submission. Mark C. Hilgard, a lawyer in Frankfurt who is chairman of the corporate and business law committee of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany, said there were still unanswered questions regarding the proposal. Foremost, he said, were questions of whether the level of protection was rigorous enough, and which courts would have jurisdiction in cases of cross-border disputes. “In theory, the idea of a common E.U. sales contract regime is great, but legally, it is not simple at all to bring this about,” Mr. Hilgard, a lawyer with the firm Mayer Brown, said. “We don’t know yet how high the standard will be, and there are other, many other, questions that need to be answered before we could take a position on it.” The proposal has raised eyebrows in Brussels because, by making the regime optional, Mrs. Reding would circumvent the daunting, time-consuming legislative process required in pushing through harmonized laws for the European single market, which in the past has allowed individual nations or groups of nations to wield a veto over significant measures. In an interview this year, Mrs. Reding said she had chosen to pursue an optional, parallel E.U. contract law regime because it would have taken a decade to get all 27 E.U. nations to agree legislatively on a common set of binding rules. “We are taking a very innovative approach,” Mrs. Reding said, “instead of setting aside national laws.” She added that she “wanted to find a solution that respects national legal traditions, while still propelling our internal market forward.”",

    "source": "G.O.P. Hopefuls, Light on Experience, Try to Build Foreign Credentials <eos> WASHINGTON — Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky likes to note that he didn’t have a foreign policy three and a half years ago, when he was a full-time ophthalmologist. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was an appellate lawyer in Houston before he was elected in 2012, a job that put him in front of judges, not world leaders. Gov. Bobby Jindal has little reason to worry that a foreign crisis is going to rock Louisiana. So when Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state and current Stanford professor, visited him last year they spoke mostly about education reform. As President Obama prepared his strategy for combating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which he will announce on Wednesday , there was no shortage of condemnation from Republicans like Mr. Paul, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Jindal, who are considering running for president in 2016. Yet they, like almost every Republican who might try to succeed Mr. Obama, have a common résumé gap: foreign policy experience. In fact, several of them will have to confront an especially glaring paradox. Like Mr. Obama when he first ran for president, they are relatively young first-term senators, with limited experience beyond the country’s borders. If the world’s unstable regions continue to dominate headlines in the next two years, some Republicans say they worry that their party’s nominee could have trouble persuading Americans to elect someone untested in international affairs. “The potential for some unforeseen events is clearly going to create a great deal of unease,” said Richard G. Lugar, the former Republican senator from Indiana who led the Foreign Relations Committee twice, in the late 1980s and the mid-2000s. With so much unrest, Mr. Lugar said, Americans will inevitably ask themselves, “What if one of these Republicans became president? Would it be any better? Are they any better prepared?” “And at the moment,” he added, “the answer is probably not.” Unlike when the elder George Bush and John McCain won the Republican nomination in part because voters put trust in their foreign policy experience, the 2016 field is likely to be dominated by candidates who lack that background — senators who have been in office just a few years and governors who have had no exposure to the complexities of war and diplomacy. Republican senators like Mr. Paul, 51, Mr. Cruz, 43, and Marco Rubio of Florida, also 43, could have an awkward case when arguing that they are better suited to address the world’s problems than Mr. Obama was when he was first elected. And while senators can point to their time in Washington as educational, the Republican governors who are weighing a White House bid, like Mr. Jindal and Chris Christie of New Jersey, have had limited global exposure. “We have just seen an incompetent senator as president, from the Republican point of view,” said Elliott Abrams, who served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush and is now with the Council on Foreign Relations. “And that argues for someone with significant executive experience,” like a governor, he added. “But those people are by definition not going to have foreign policy experience.” While unstable international conditions would seem to boost Hillary Rodham Clinton, who served as Mr. Obama’s secretary of state, if Americans still associate her with the policies of an administration they view with growing disapproval, Mrs. Clinton could find her tenure as Mr. Obama’s chief diplomat a liability. “She does not want to totally identify herself with Obama foreign policy,” said Lee H. Hamilton, the Democratic former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence Committees. “On the other hand, it’s not credible to totally separate herself.” Image Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is among the potential candidates who have sought advice from conservative thinkers. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Still, voters tend to look to their own economic prospects rather than to conflicts thousands of miles away. Even in presidential elections when foreign involvement was central, including in 1980, during the Iranian hostage crisis, the percentage of people who named international affairs as the most important issue facing the country has been outnumbered by those who cited economic concerns in Gallup polls. In a CNN/ORC International poll conducted Sept. 5 through 7, just 7 percent of respondents said the situation in Iraq and Syria was the most pressing concern facing the country today, compared with 30 percent who identified the economy as the top concern — by far the most common response. International inexperience has not prevented Republicans or Democrats from winning. Ronald Reagan, who as a former California governor had a limited background in foreign policy, defeated Jimmy Carter. (A badly deteriorated economy was even more important to voters that year.) Mr. Reagan’s pick of Mr. Bush, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and ambassador to the United Nations, helped balance the ticket. In 1992, Mr. Bush found out painfully that his credentials, which by then included winning the Persian Gulf war, did not sway voters who wanted a new direction on the economy and elected Bill Clinton. George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, persuaded voters in 2000 to overlook his foreign policy shortcomings by surrounding himself with respected hands like Dick Cheney, a former defense secretary, and Ms. Rice. The leading Republican contenders for the 2016 nomination are, to varying degrees, building their portfolios with high-profile speeches and the hiring of staff members versed in world affairs. Mr. Paul has taken pains to distance himself from the more isolationist views of his father, Ron. In an opinion article published by Time last week, with the headline, “ I Am Not an Isolationist ,” he argued for destroying Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria. Mr. Rubio, who is one of only two Republican senators to serve on the Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, is planning a major foreign policy speech this month. His schedule, advisers said, has included meetings with foreign dignitaries, including the former leader of the Syrian opposition coalition, Ahmad al-Jarba. Mr. Cruz has wooed leading conservative thinkers like William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard. Mr. Jindal has positioned himself as aggressively hawkish, particularly with regard to Syria. In an opinion piece published last month on the website of Fox News, he wrote of the people who beheaded James Foley, the captured photographer: “ How about we offer these people death instead of justice? ” Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Mr. Christie have been courting Republican elder statesmen. Mr. Perry has met with George P. Shultz, Mr. Reagan’s secretary of state. And Mr. Christie has met with Henry Kissinger. But conservatives acknowledge that candidates in the 2016 field have a long way to go in convincing voters they can be trusted on the world stage. “It’s not about, ‘I spent three hours with Henry Kissinger and now I’m ready to be president,’ ” said James Jay Carafano, vice president of foreign and defense policy studies for the Heritage Foundation. Mr. Carafano has met with almost all the 2016 contenders. “It really is about doing your homework,” he said. “In some ways, it’s a voyage of self-discovery.”",

    "source": "Foam and Frustration in the Air as Lakers Fall to Cavaliers <eos> LOS ANGELES — As the exasperation mounted, so did the technical fouls, and one by one the Lakers began collecting them. Then one by one, and soon by the dozens, foam souvenirs began raining down on the court, joined by the odd water bottle. What began as a festive day, with the Lakers taking their place in the N.B.A.’s marquee Christmas Day event, ended with an abundance of frustration — with themselves and the officials — in a 102-87 thumping by the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday. “That was not a very nice way to spend Christmas Day, to tell you the truth,” said Lakers Coach Phil Jackson, whose viewpoint was echoed by much of the capacity crowd. The Lakers entered the day not only as the defending N.B.A. champions, but also as the owners of the best record in the league. They had won 15 of 16 games since Pau Gasol returned from a hamstring injury. But the Cavaliers, with myriad questions — not the least of which is whether LeBron James will leave town next summer — pushed them around for most of the afternoon. Cleveland got 28 points from point guard Mo Williams and 26 from James, but it was the Cavaliers’ willingness to get physical that separated them from the Lakers. Cleveland jumped to a 20-point lead in the second quarter, and when the Lakers’ comeback went nowhere in the second half, they began to bicker with the Cavaliers and the officials. Lamar Odom drew two technicals, earning an ejection, and Kobe Bryant got one for a dismissive wave after being called for a foul following complaints about earlier no-calls. Derek Fisher earned a technical foul for leveling Williams with a shoulder, and the Lakers’ bench got another when Jackson did not make a substitution in a timely manner. After two of the calls, the usually well-mannered Lakers crowd tossed down foam souvenirs that had been given out. “That said everything you need to know about the refereeing,” Lakers center Andrew Bynum said. Bryant scored 35 points, but shot 11 of 32 and got little help from his teammates. Gasol and Bynum never gave the Lakers any inside presence and Odom had 6 points and 5 rebounds before his exit. “You don’t want to lay an egg on Christmas,” Odom said. “But we did. We just didn’t compete as hard as they did. We are a lot tougher than that, mentally and physically.” The Cavaliers had looked to Friday’s game as a significant test. Other than a win at Orlando, they had shown few signs that they were ready to challenge the Celtics, or even the Magic, for supremacy in the Eastern Conference. “It wasn’t about sending a message to them,” James said. “It was about sending a message to ourselves and seeing how we match up with the best team in the N.B.A. at this point.” The league placed the Cavaliers and the Lakers on their center stage because James and Bryant are considered the two best players and biggest stars in the game. The Cavaliers also brought along Shaquille O’Neal. There was a time when Christmas Day belonged to O’Neal. The league and the networks built the holiday around O’Neal’s jolly giant persona, whether he was playing for the Lakers or, later, against them. On Friday, O’Neal was a bit player. His feud with his former teammate Bryant has waned. They were all smiles while sharing the M.V.P. award at last season’s All-Star Game, and O’Neal is averaging a career-low 10.2 points this season. He was all smiles Thursday when he handed out Christmas presents to 150 children at a Boys and Girls Club in South Central Los Angeles. But Shaq-a-Claus was not so benevolent on Friday. He leveled Fisher with a pick, floored Gasol, who was on his way to a layup, and knocked down Bryant on a drive to the basket — all in the first quarter. “That’s how big guys play,” O’Neal said of his foul on Gasol. “I don’t get anything at Christmas. I’m Santa.” O’Neal finished with modest totals of 11 points and 7 rebounds in 21 minutes, but his biggest contribution might have been making the lane a no-fly zone for the Lakers. “He definitely had a presence in the game,” Jackson said. “I do know that he was a factor on Kobe.” The question that will only be answered in May — whether O’Neal can solve the Cavaliers’ problems in the playoffs with a pick-and-roll — was made moot for a day. The loss did not seem to raise many questions for the Lakers. They quickly acknowledged that the Cavaliers played with more energy than they did, but there have been far fewer of these moments this season than there were last — or during last season’s playoffs. “They played harder than we did,” Bryant said. “It’s as simple as that.” One of the few Lakers who did not give in to frustration was, perhaps surprisingly, Ron Artest. He made James work before fouling out, which was when the foam started flying. Artest will forever be linked with the game at Detroit in which fans threw objects on the court and he charged into the stands to fight several of them . After soaking his feet in a bucket of ice, he was asked what he thought of the crowd’s reaction. “I don’t know,” Artest said with a laugh, one of the few the Lakers could afford.",

    "source": "Swiss Back Away From Deal to Give Names of Wealthy UBS Clients to U.S. <eos> The Swiss government on Wednesday backed off an agreement with the United States that required it to hand over the names of wealthy American clients of the Swiss bank UBS who were suspected of tax evasion. The announcement, which came after two Swiss courts ruled that the disclosure of client names would be illegal because it would violate the country’s secrecy laws, threatened to open a new front in the investigation into UBS by the Justice Department. While the Swiss cabinet, known as the Swiss Federal Council, said in a statement that it would continue talks with the United States on the matter, it said there was a risk that the United States would resume civil proceedings filed against UBS in a Florida court last year. That case sought to force UBS to disclose the names of 52,000 wealthy American clients suspected of tax evasion through UBS’s private bank. That lawsuit was suspended in August when the Swiss government, acting on behalf of UBS during months of intense negotiations, promised to hand over 4,450 UBS client names. The Swiss cabinet said it might put the disclosure of the names up for approval before the Swiss Parliament — but only if it received detailed information from the Internal Revenue Service on how many UBS clients had come forward under a voluntary disclosure program that ended in November. That program brought in 14,700 clients from many banks, including UBS. That could allow the Swiss to avoid having to identify people who had already come forward. I.R.S. officials said Wednesday that Switzerland needed to hew to the August deal. “We expect the Swiss government to continue to honor the terms of the agreement,” the agency said in a statement. The Justice Department declined to comment. “The Swiss right now need to do their Swiss thing — they’re trying to find a creative way to get this thing done,” said a top American government official who was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter. “Even in the light of the Swiss Administrative Court’s ruling, we will try to comply with the provisions of the treaty,” Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, the Swiss justice minister, said after a meeting of the Swiss cabinet. The Swiss cabinet said it was not contesting Switzerland’s disclosure of 250 names to the Justice Department in February. That move was part of a deal that helped UBS avoid indictment and instead pay a $780 million fine and admit to criminal wrongdoing with its offshore private banking services sold to Americans. “An exchange of information with the U.S. authorities is only possible in about 250 cases,” the cabinet said. Finma, the Swiss regulatory agency, said in February that not turning over the 250 names could have harmed UBS and the global economy. The Swiss did not explain how the disclosure of the 250 names was not deemed to be a breach of Swiss privacy laws while disclosure of the 4,450 was. At issue is what Cono Namorato, a partner at the Washington law firm Caplin & Drysdale, said was “a very, very different definition of fraud” by the Swiss — one that distinguishes between tax evasion, or simply not paying taxes, which is not regarded as a crime, and tax fraud, which is regarded as a crime but involves ill-gotten gains from activities like money laundering or the deliberate falsification of documents. Kevin E. Packman, a tax lawyer at Holland & Knight in Miami, said that the Swiss courts “have put UBS and, to some extent, the Swiss government in an uncomfortable position. I suspect that if the courts don’t cooperate with the government to find a solution, things are going to get really ugly for UBS.” In a statement, UBS said that it “welcomes the fact that the Swiss Federal Council is pursuing a dialogue with the U.S. authorities.” “UBS’s new management will fully support the search for a solution,” it added. “As before, we will fulfill all our commitments under the agreement.” Peter J. Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University Law School in Detroit and a former Justice Department criminal fraud investigator, said that with the original August deal, “the Swiss tried to pull a fast one on their own country. They really haven’t changed their underlying bank secrecy laws, and their courts, and now their government, are saying, ‘You can’t just do that.’ The Swiss government is in a really bad situation. They have to confront the issue of bank secrecy — what do they want, what are they willing to live with.”",

    "source": "New Factor in Campus Sexual Assault Cases: Counsel for the Accused <eos> As the Columbia University student tells it, the encounter was harmless fun: A female freshman invited him into her suite bathroom, got a condom, took off her clothes and had sex with him. But as that young woman later described it to university officials, the encounter was not consensual. The university suspended him for a year. He felt the outcome was unjust, but he did not know what to do about it. His lawyer, Andrew Miltenberg of Manhattan, did. Invoking Title IX, the federal gender-equality statute that is typically used to protect the rights of female students, he sued Columbia , saying his client had been “discriminated against on the basis of his male sex.” At a moment when students who have been sexually assaulted are finding new ways to make their voices heard, and as college officials across the country are rushing to meet new government standards, a specialized class of lawyers is raising its voice, too. They are speaking out on behalf of the students they describe as most vulnerable: not those who might be subjected to sexual assault, but those who have been accused of it. To do so, they have appropriated the legal tools most commonly used to fight sexual misconduct and turned them against the prosecution, confronting higher education’s whole approach to the issue, which they describe as a civil rights disaster. “Everyone’s first blush when you think about this is: It’s sort of an ugly position to take,” Mr. Miltenberg said of defending the accused students. “My own family members have said to me: ‘What are you doing? You’re 49 years old. You have a successful business litigation practice. Why would you jump into this?’ ” Image \"Most of the time I’m looking to seal the records or have this redacted upon graduation so it doesn’t follow them around for the rest of their lives,\" said Andrew Miltenberg, a Manhattan lawyer who is critical of college sexual assault policies. Credit Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times He said he felt compelled to get involved when he saw how colleges handled accused students. “You’ve got factual statements made that you’re not necessarily allowed to review and you’re certainly not allowed to have copies of,” he said. “You may or may not be able to present your witnesses. You probably don’t have the chance to cross-examine.” To women’s rights activists, objections like those may have an oddly familiar ring. For decades, activists have argued that campus policies were biased against accusers, who are typically women; that the officials who run the investigations lacked training; that assailants were absolved far too easily. (One recent study determined that among students found by their colleges to have committed sexual assault, fewer than one-third were expelled.) Now, defense lawyers are denouncing inconsistent standards and inadequate training, but they arrive at the opposite conclusion: The system is biased, the lawyers say, against men. Last month, 28 members of the Harvard Law School faculty published an op-ed criticizing Harvard’s sexual misconduct policies for “the absence of any adequate opportunity to discover the facts charged and to confront witnesses and present a defense at an adversary hearing,” for exceeding the parameters of Title IX and for “the failure to ensure adequate representation for the accused.” Harvard defended those policies as “an expert, neutral, fair, and objective mechanism” but said it would continue to review them. During the 12-month period it most recently tracked, the federal Education Department received 96 Title IX complaints related to sexual violence. In the previous period, that number was 32. The department does not track how many were lodged by women and how many by men. A database maintained by a group called A Voice for Male Students counted 11 lawsuits this year in which male students “wrongly accused of sex crimes found themselves hustled through a vague and misshapen adjudication process with slipshod checks and balances and Kafkaesque standards of evidence.” A group of 30 or so lawyers from across the country participate in a running email discussion about how to approach these issues; 20 or so gathered in Washington last month to share their experiences. A similar number recently stepped into the political arena when they signed a letter denouncing the Campus Accountability and Safety Act proposed by Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri; the measure is intended to help universities address sexual misconduct more effectively. “By presuming that all accusers are in fact ‘victims,’ ” the letter said, “the proposed legislation does a grave disservice to those accused of serious sexual offenses.” Image Faculty members at Harvard Law School have been critical of Harvard’s sexual misconduct policies. Credit Gretchen Ertl for The New York Times Members of this small but fast-growing legal specialty say the problem dates to 2011, when the Education Department advised colleges to take sexual assault more seriously and to lower the burden of proof for people bringing complaints. Since then, a White House task force has issued new guidelines and the Office of Civil Rights has released the names of more than 85 colleges that are under investigation for not doing enough. Faced with all that political pressure, said Joshua Adam Engel , a lawyer in Mason, Ohio, colleges are panicking. So are students. Since the beginning of the current semester, when a senior named Emma Sulkowicz began carrying her dormitory mattress as a public protest against the way Columbia had handled her sexual misconduct complaint, Mr. Miltenberg said, he gets a call from a new male Columbia student more or less weekly. The client who sued the university for discrimination argued that his suspension amounted to “a rush to judgment, pandering to the political climate on campus” and pressure from women’s groups. Columbia has sought to have the lawsuit dismissed , saying it failed to prove anti-male bias. “That argument proceeds from both a misapprehension about the nature of university disciplinary proceedings — which are not criminal prosecutions — and a misunderstanding about Columbia’s definition of sexual misconduct — which is intended to protect students not only from forcible rape, but also from unreasonable pressure to accede to sexual advances,” Columbia’s lawyers wrote in a filing last month. Colby Bruno, senior legal counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center , said the growing involvement of lawyers could be beneficial. But too often, she said, defense lawyers enter the campus proceedings “shouting from the rooftops about things that aren’t relevant to the matter at hand.” Those include due process, a set of regulations that private colleges are not required to observe, and the right to avoid self-incrimination, which applies only to people facing criminal prosecution. “It’s when the decision-makers aren’t equipped to handle attorneys that the decision-makers start getting pushed around, policies start getting changed, and that is where a school can get in real trouble with Title IX,” Ms. Bruno said. Lawyers for the accused, Mr. Miltenberg said, are not always seeking to have judgments overturned. “Most of the time I’m looking to seal the records or have this redacted upon graduation so it doesn’t follow them around for the rest of their lives,” he said. But success does not come cheaply. Litigating a case through a trial could cost $100,000, he said. Judith Grossman, a lawyer — and a feminist, she made a point of adding — got involved in the cause when her son successfully fought an accusation of sexual misconduct. “I think that there is no question that there is an issue of sexual assault in this country, on campus and off campus, but this is not the first issue in our country where a bumper sticker approach has been applied to a nuanced problem,” Ms. Grossman said. The alternative, however, is not so easy to identify. Mr. Miltenberg said he thought colleges should leave the investigation of serious crimes to the police. But the judicial system moves slowly, he acknowledged, and if a daughter of his were assaulted he would not want her sharing a campus with her accused assailant for years as the case inched toward trial. At Columbia, which recently became one of the few colleges to offer free legal help to both accusers and the accused, Suzanne B. Goldberg , a special adviser to the university’s president on sexual assault prevention and response, observed that “lawyers can help protect the rights of accused students.” But, she said, “they come at a potential cost” to what is set up to be an educational experience. “There is no cost-free solution,” she said.",

    "source": "High Corporate Profits Could Reduce Risk in Junk Bonds <eos> AT a time of ridiculously low interest rates, some income-starved investors have been drawn to high-yield bonds , a risky but often misunderstood asset class that can add a bit of stability as well as punch to a portfolio. High-yield — often called junk — bonds paid about 8.34 percentage points more than United States Treasury issues of comparable maturity, on average, on Sept. 30. Although that is well under the double-digit point premiums that prevailed at market bottoms during the last decade, specialists say that this may still be a profitable time to consider high-yield mutual funds , which are particularly appropriate for tax-sheltered accounts. “I think the market is attractive,” said William J. Morgan, senior high-yield portfolio manager for J. P. Morgan Asset Management. Junk bonds were trading as if almost 9 percent of issues will default over the coming year, Mr. Morgan observed, even as Moody’s Investors Service projects that only 1 percent to 2 percent will do so. “I see high-yield as offering pretty decent value here,” agreed Matt Eagan, co-manager of the Loomis Sayles Bond fund, which invests up to 35 percent of assets in lower-rated securities. Mr. Eagan noted that despite weak economic growth, American companies are enjoying hefty profits, indicating that they cannot only handle interest and principal payments on their bonds but also can take advantage of today’s low interest rates should they need to refinance. “The default rate is likely to remain low,” he said, and is quite unlikely to rise much above 5 percent even if the economy skids back into recession . Default rates peaked at more than 10 percent after the 2008 meltdown, in the early 2000s and in the early 1990s. Investors who cringe at the idea of buying low-quality debt — the BBB rating is generally considered the border with investment -grade bonds — should recognize that it can act as a kind of stabilizing portfolio ballast, some specialists maintain. “A certain mix of higher-quality and high-yield bonds lowers volatility while boosting and smoothing returns,” Mr. Morgan said. Major companies, not just start-ups or fringe telecoms, are now among the biggest issuers of high-yield — the likes of Ford Motor Credit, the CIT Group, the Hospital Corporation of America, Ally Bank and Sprint Nextel. Still, the market for high-yield bonds is highly volatile and subject to periodic bouts of illiquidity like the one that occurred in August. That is when the fund category, which had been posting double-digit returns during the preceding 12 months, suffered its biggest monthly loss — 4.37 percent — since 2008, according to Morningstar. (The high-yield market had a lesser skid in the second half of September.) PRICES slumped after Standard & Poor’s, citing the political stalemate after a rancorous Congressional debt-ceiling debate, cut the United States’ credit rating. High-yield investors are very attuned to talk of defaults, but the market also suffered from the European financial turmoil and even the effects of the Japanese tsunami. “The market had a mass anxiety attack, as all risk assets did,” said Mark Vaselkiv, manager of the T. Rowe Price High Yield fund. The performance of high-yield bonds, unlike that of investment-grade issues, is very sensitive to the stock market and the economy. Good times indicate that borrowers have a greater ability to service debt, which is far more important to high-yield buyers than the rising interest rates that typically accompany faster growth and that depress the prices of better-quality bonds. The risk of rising rates, in fact, is limited for high-yield bonds because they almost always come due in 5 to 10 years, compared with 30 years or more for most other corporate bonds. Moreover, their high interest rates provide a cushion against falling prices in a rate upswing. “High-yield will outperform when interest rates go up,” Mr. Morgan said. Many specialists say the only sensible way for ordinary investors to buy high-yield debt is through mutual funds — both to obtain essential diversification and to avoid being victimized by wide gaps between buying and selling prices in a market that may have relatively little activity. Retail investors in individual bonds are taking big risks, partly because of the likelihood of unfavorable execution of orders, Mr. Vaselkiv said. Jeff Tjornehoj, a senior research analyst at Lipper, said that one excellent fund was Fidelity Capital and Income , because of consistent long-term performance, tax efficiency and annual expenses of a reasonable 0.76 percent. It returned 7 percent, annualized, in the five years through Sept. 30 but lost 10.8 percent in the quarter, according to Morningstar. Some 43 percent of its portfolio is in bonds rated B, and 12 percent are rated CCC or below; 17 percent of the fund is invested in stocks. He said the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate fund has been a high-quality “middle of the road” performer with a portfolio averaging a B rating. It returned 3.7 percent in the quarter , while charging just 0.25 percent in expenses, according to Morningstar. But there is substantial variation among the more than 500 high-yield funds, with some embracing bonds rated CCC or even lower, as well as common and preferred stocks, convertibles or even derivatives . The unwary may find the junk market downright treacherous, Mr. Tjornehoj cautioned. “The investor must accept greater volatility and a real risk of loss,” he said, pointing to the Oppenheimer Champion Income fund, which lost about four-fifths of its value in 2008 because of heavy losses on credit default swaps and mortgage -backed securities. Potential buyers should at least check a fund’s portfolio to make sure it isn’t committed to more low-quality risk than they want and isn’t overly concentrated in certain industries. Good credit analysis by fund managers should uncover issues that are candidates for a ratings upgrade. Zane E. Brown, a fixed-income strategist at Lord Abbett, noted that gambling, leisure and automotive companies are frequent high-yield borrowers, which could lead to unbalanced fund portfolios if such companies are overrepresented. He now frowns on the bonds of home builders and companies in the paper, publishing and printing industries because, he says, their prospects are generally poor. While defaults are the biggest hazard in the junk market, analysts also try to predict how much can be salvaged when they occur. The average recovery has run at 44 percent, Mr. Morgan said. ALTHOUGH many high-yield managers include a wide variety of securities in their portfolios, Mr. Brown sticks closely to corporate bonds. He avoids foreign government bonds because they are harder to analyze and are subject to sudden political change. Investors should beware of funds offering the very highest current returns, experts also said. Not only might their holdings be of very low quality, but the managers may be paying premium prices, thereby returning some principal in the guise of interest, Mr. Eagan said. With these cautions, high-yield may be appealing these days — though not the screaming bargain it proved to be when market liquidity evaporated in 2008. But Mr. Vaselkiv issued a caveat: This market may be good “as long as we don’t go into a double-dip recession,” he said. “It’s really a bet on the U.S. economy.”",

    "source": "Benjamin Rhodes, Obama’s Voice, Helps Shape Policy <eos> WASHINGTON — As President Obama prepares to visit Israel next week, he is turning, as he often does, to Benjamin J. Rhodes, a 35-year-old deputy national security adviser with a soft voice, strong opinions and a reputation around the White House as the man who channels Mr. Obama on foreign policy. Mr. Rhodes is drafting the address to the Israeli people the president plans to give in Jerusalem, but his influence extends beyond what either his title or speechwriting duties suggest. Drawing on personal ties and a philosophical kinship with Mr. Obama that go back to the 2008 campaign, Mr. Rhodes helped prod his boss to take a more activist policy toward Egypt and Libya when those countries erupted in 2011. Now that influence is being put to the test again on the issue of Syria, where the president has so far resisted more than modest American involvement. After two years of civil war that have left 70,000 people dead, Mr. Rhodes, his friends and colleagues said, is deeply frustrated by a policy that is not working, and has become a strong advocate for more aggressive efforts to support the Syrian opposition. Administration officials note that Mr. Rhodes is not alone in his frustration over Syria, pointing out that Mr. Obama, too, is searching for an American response that ends the humanitarian tragedy, while not enmeshing the United States in a sectarian conflict that many in the White House say bears unsettling similarities to Iraq. Three former officials of the administration — Hillary Rodham Clinton, Robert Gates and David Petraeus — favored arming the opposition, a position Mr. Rhodes did not initially support. “It’s hard for Ben in the same way it’s hard for the president,” said Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, who worked closely with Mr. Rhodes in his previous job as the principal deputy national security adviser. “He cares about people. You can’t see what’s happening in Syria and not be torn by it. At the same time, he’s very realistic.” Normally, the anguish of a White House deputy would matter little to the direction of American foreign policy. But Mr. Rhodes has had a knack for making himself felt, not just in the way the president expresses his policies but in how he formulates them. Two years ago, when protesters thronged Tahrir Square in Cairo, Mr. Rhodes urged Mr. Obama to withdraw three decades of American support for President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. A few months later, Mr. Rhodes was among those agitating for the president to back a NATO military intervention in Libya to head off a slaughter by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. “He became, first in the speechwriting process, and later, in the heat of the Arab Spring, a central figure,” said Michael A. McFaul, who worked with Mr. Rhodes in the National Security Council and is now the American ambassador to Russia. Samantha Power, another former National Security Council colleague who joined him in advocating intervention in Libya, said: “He has a very high batting average in terms of prognostication. I don’t understand where Ben gets his ‘old man’ wisdom.” Remarkably, Mr. Rhodes seems to have amassed his influence without rankling older and more seasoned advisers — a testament, colleagues say, to a diplomatic style not always common to members of Mr. Obama’s inner circle. Mr. Rhodes has exerted influence outside the Middle East as well. In 2011, he worked with Jacob J. Sullivan, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, to persuade Mr. Obama to engage with the military rulers of Myanmar, formerly Burma, after gaining the endorsement of the pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. “The person behind the scenes who played the largest role in the opening to Burma and the engagement with Aung San Suu Kyi was Ben Rhodes,” said Kurt M. Campbell, a former assistant secretary of state who led the negotiations with the Myanmar government. Engineering a shift in Mr. Obama’s Syria policy is probably more difficult than persuading him to reach out to Myanmar, officials said, given the complexities of Syria, the volatility of its neighborhood, the grinding nature of the conflict, and the president’s deep aversion to getting entangled in another military conflict in the Middle East. Not only is the United States limiting its support of the Free Syrian Army to food rations and medical supplies, the White House has designated one of the main Sunni insurgent groups, al-Nusra front, as a terrorist organization — a policy that alienated many Syrians because of the group’s effectiveness in fighting President Bashar al-Assad. Colleagues say Mr. Rhodes opposed that decision, which was pushed by intelligence advisers. He also favors equipping the rebels with more robust nonlethal gear and training that would help them in their fight against Mr. Assad’s government, a position shared by Britain and other allies. Mr. Rhodes declined to comment in detail on his role in policy deliberations, saying “my main job, which has always been my job, is to be the person who represents the president’s view on these issues.” In many ways, Mr. Rhodes is an improbable choice for a job at the heart of the national security apparatus. An aspiring writer from Manhattan, he has an unfinished novel in a drawer, “Oasis of Love,” about a woman who joins a megachurch in Houston, breaking her boyfriend’s heart. The son of a conservative-leaning Episcopalian father from Texas and a more liberal Jewish mother from New York, Mr. Rhodes grew up in a home where even sports loyalties were divided: he and his mother are ardent Mets fans; his father and his older brother, David, root for the Yankees. “No one in that house agreed on anything,” said David Rhodes, who is now the president of CBS News. Benjamin Rhodes, who worked briefly for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani’s re-election campaign in 1997, was living a writer’s life in Queens on Sept. 11, 2001, when he watched from the Brooklyn waterfront as the World Trade Center towers collapsed. The trauma of that experience, he said, led him to move to Washington in 2002. Mr. Rhodes went to work for a Democratic foreign-policy elder, former Representative Lee Hamilton, helping draft the 9/11 Commission report as well as the Iraq Study Group report. That report was a template for the anti-Iraq war positions taken by Barack Obama, then a senator, whose campaign Mr. Rhodes joined as a speechwriter in 2008. At the White House, Mr. Rhodes first came to prominence after he wrote Mr. Obama’s landmark address to the Muslim world in Cairo in June 2009. The speech was notable for Mr. Obama’s assertion that governments should “reflect the will of the people,” prefiguring his policy in dealing with Mr. Mubarak and Colonel Qaddafi. In writing Mr. Obama’s speech next week, Mr. Rhodes is likely to focus on America’s unshakable support for Israel. But if history is any guide, he will slip in a reference to Syria’s democratic future. “Ben always holds on to the pen,” Mr. McFaul said. “Because of his close personal relationship with the president, Ben can always make policy through the speeches and statements made by President Obama.”",

    "source": "An Alarm Is Blaring: Time to Buy <eos> MARKET timing — trying to jump into or out of the stock market just before rallies and declines — is notoriously difficult. Most investors would probably be better off sticking with a buy-and-hold strategy. Nevertheless, anyone trying to beat the odds may be interested in a market indicator with an excellent track record — and it has just flashed a buy signal. Of course, it is just one signpost, so proceed with caution. But it may help shift the weight of market evidence toward the bulls. Called the Recession Buy Indicator, it was devised by Norman Fosback, who was editor of Mutual Funds magazine in the 1990s and the author in the mid-1970s of the popular investment textbook “Stock Market Logic.” He currently edits Fosback’s Fund Forecaster, an investment newsletter. The indicator is based on the notion that it is darkest just before the dawn — that when the economic news becomes bad enough, the stock market’s likely subsequent direction is up. Because the stock market is forward-looking, Mr. Fosback said in the most recent issue of his newsletter, it “has little use for yesterday’s, or even today’s, crises.” “The focus,” he added, “is always on the future — how will business be six months, or a year or two, from now?” When the economy appears to be on tenuous ground, as it does today, he said, “stock investors looking well out to the future are able to perceive the seeds of the next economic expansion.” It is one thing to appreciate this market cycle from a conceptual point of view, but quite another to come up with a market-timing system based on it. Mr. Fosback’s indicator focuses on the four business barometers that together make up the federal government’s index of coincident economic indicators. These four focus on industrial production, manufacturing and trade sales, nonfarm payrolls and personal income. The Recession Buy Indicator is triggered when — as is the case today — each of these four gauges is below its level of six months earlier. On such occasions, Mr. Fosback considers the economy to be in a recession or very close to it. He came up with this indicator in 1979, and since then it has set off four buy signals (not counting the current one). On average over the 12 months following those signals, according to his research, the average stock on the New York Stock Exchange had a total return of 37 percent. And in the three years after such a signal, the average gain was 106 percent. These gains are triple the stock market’s long-term average. (Mr. Fosback has also backtested this indicator to the late 1940s, the earliest period for which data on the coincident economic indicators were available, and it performed just as well from then until the late ’70s as it did in more recent decades.) NOT everyone draws the conclusions that Mr. Fosback does. Ned Davis Research, an institutional research firm based in Venice, Fla., has extensively studied the stock market’s performance during and after United States recessions since World War II. Like Mr. Fosback, the firm’s analysts found that the stock market typically hit bottom six months after a recession began, and that at such times the stock market was a “table-pounding buy.” But, in an interview, Ed Clissold, the firm’s senior global analyst, cautioned that this conclusion was based on an average, and that on some past occasions the stock market’s actual bottom came much later. That is one reason, he said, that his firm doesn’t mechanically issue a buy signal six months after the economy begins to turn downward. Instead, it prefers to await confirmation from a number of its other indicators that a bottom has been formed. In the current market, that confirmation has not yet come, he said, and his firm has a policy of not trying to predict when it will. The advantages of not automatically jumping into the market six months into a recession were clear the last time the Recession Buy Indicator flashed: in February 2001, a year and a half before the low of the 2000-2 bear market. In his latest newsletter, Mr. Fosback acknowledged that this particular signal was “the poorest performing of the 10 signals” since World War II. Even so, he argued, the average stock was still higher three years later. He agreed that many people might be wary of plunging into the market when the economic news is so bad. But, he added, his indicator is a classic illustration of the virtues of contrary opinion: “When everything seems gloomy, it’s time for the smart money to buy.”",

    "source": "Massachusetts Acting to Extend Abortion Buffer <eos> BOSTON, Nov. 8 — The Massachusetts legislature gave final approval Thursday to a bill that requires protesters to stand at least 35 feet from clinics that offer abortions. The bill, which Gov. Deval L. Patrick is expected to sign next week, will be the nation’s strictest state law establishing fixed zones that protesters cannot enter around those reproductive health clinics that offer abortions. The current law, enacted in 2000, says protesters cannot go within 6 feet of a person in an 18-foot zone outside a clinic’s doors. The authorities said it was difficult to enforce. The bill passed the Senate unanimously on Thursday and the House in a 122-to-28 vote. Ten reproductive health clinics in the state offer abortions. The bill does not apply to hospitals . “The basic goal of the bill is to make sure patients and staff can enter reproductive health facilities without being obstructed, intimidated and harassed,” said Representative Carl M. Sciortino Jr., a Democrat who is one of the bill’s sponsors. “Current law is completely unenforceable and did not protect patients and staff the way it intended.” Opponents of the new bill say it violates free speech rights. “There’s no question there will be litigation,” said Marie Sturgis, the executive director of Massachusetts Citizens for Life. “This certainly clashes with First Amendment rights, and is something we should all be concerned about.” The state’s Supreme Judicial Court upheld the constitutionality of buffer zones in 2001 after the current law was challenged. Proponents say the zones are meant to protect patients and staff members from unwanted attention. “We’re trying to have a very small, but important, zone of safety for patients and staff who are entering these facilities,” said Kelly O’Bryan, the political director for Naral Pro-Choice Massachusetts. “We’re not trying to silence them at all.” The call for buffer zones started in 1994 after John C. Salvi III killed two women and wounded five other people at two abortion clinics in Brookline, Mass. Colorado and Montana have buffer zone laws similar to the current Massachusetts law, and many cities and towns have similar ordinances. The country’s largest fixed buffer zone, 36 feet, is in effect in Melbourne, Fla.",

    "source": "At Midterm, Every Campaign Is About Obama <eos> Texas Democrats are trying to put together a ticket to run against the Republicans in 2014. But Texas Republicans don’t care whose names appear on the other ballot; they already know the name of the candidate they’re running against: Barack Obama. For Texas officeholders from Attorney General Greg Abbott and United States Senator John Cornyn down to your local Republican sheriff, the president is the guy on the other side. Lately, that conservative opposition has collected around House and Senate debate about repealing the federal Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. But the antipathy toward the president has animated Texas Republican politics for several years now, driving a huge change in the partisan makeup of the Texas House in 2010 and focusing Republican candidates on a common foe. Primary elections are five months off. Candidates are raising money and traveling the state, although they can’t officially file for office until November. But the campaign against Mr. Obama is well under way. This is not a new thing, but it imperils incumbent Democrats on the local and state level (and in the case of the latter, their ranks are already thin) and increases the difficulty for Democrats trying to battle their way into state offices held by Republicans for nearly two decades. Texas chooses its state officeholders in nonpresidential years. Fewer voters turn out in those elections, and those who do take part often use the opportunity to send midterm love letters to sitting presidents. An anti-Obama wave helped Republicans gain a supermajority in the Texas House in 2010. Midterm elections during Bill Clinton’s presidency also featured backlashes. Ann Richards fell to George W. Bush in 1994. Four years later, Republicans swept the statewide executive branch offices for the first time in a modern Texas election. Jimmy Carter — the last Democratic presidential candidate who carried Texas, in 1976 — saw those same voters turn around two years later and elect their first Republican governor since Reconstruction. Voters share their anger with Republicans too. Ronald Reagan’s first midterm election in 1982 was accompanied by a Democratic sweep of statewide offices, including the ouster of Gov. Bill Clements, elected in Mr. Carter’s midterm. (He won back the office in 1986, when Reagan was receiving decent marks from Texas voters.) In 1990, the Republicans thought they might have a sweep of their own, but the voters gave their fellow Texan George H. W. Bush a Hallmark card with Ann Richards’s (Democratic) face on it. Two Republican newcomers made it into office that year — Kay Bailey Hutchison as state treasurer and Rick Perry as agriculture commissioner — but the rest of the executive office candidates were washed away. Midterm beneficiaries are often the candidates from the party that doesn’t hold the White House. If the federal government is unpopular, and it often is, candidates from the party on the outs in Washington have extra ammunition. Texas voters give the president mixed grades on job performance, with 43 percent saying he is doing a good job and 50 percent disapproving of the job he’s doing, according to a June University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll. A look inside those numbers reveals the polarizing effect Mr. Obama has: nearly 84 percent of Democrats gave the president high marks, and 90 percent of Republicans gave him low marks. But you do not need a poll to see it. Just look at what the candidates are saying. Republicans in Texas are loudly distancing themselves from the president and his signature program, and as soon as their opponents from the Democratic side line up, they’ll be working hard to handcuff those Democrats to a president they believe is unpopular with Texas voters. If Mr. Obama is popular a year from now, as candidates close on the 2014 general election, Democrats will be begging him to visit Texas and to appear onstage with them. If his numbers then look like his numbers today, Republicans will be begging him to appear onstage with those same Democrats. That’s the political part of the president’s job — to be the personification of his party, for better and for worse. Right now, at least in Texas, Mr. Obama figures into the calculations of every Democrat trying to decide whether to challenge a Republican, particularly at the statewide level. Their Republican opponents are counting on him.",

    "source": "Officials in Guatemala Urge Residents to Leave Settlement Hit by a Landslide <eos> SANTA CATARINA PINULA, Guatemala — From the roof of his house, Julio René Barillas can see the gash in the mountainside where the earth gave way and buried the houses below. He heard the deafening noise and saw the landslide swallow up the neighborhood just 100 yards away. “They never had a chance,” said Mr. Barillas, 61, an evangelical pastor. “There was nothing they could do.” But he said he would not leave, though it was clear that his own house was in peril. Below and above it, trees had been uprooted and the land itself seemed prepared to crumble at any moment. “This is our house. Our family’s house,” Mr. Barillas said on Monday. “I have faith nothing will happen.” Four days after a landslide destroyed the concrete block settlement of El Cambray II, burying hundreds of people, officials armed with maps moved through the neighboring streets, knocking on doors, taking count and noting the risks. In the wake of one of Guatemala’s worst natural disasters in years, officials at the National Coordination for Disaster Reduction said they would try to persuade the families living on the unstable land around the collapsed hillside to move. Sergio Cabañas, who is in charge of the recovery effort for the agency, said that a crack had appeared in the crown of the hill above the village. Six small landslides had been detected in the area. Manuel Pocasangre, a spokesman for the Santa Catarina Pinula city government, said, “It’s impossible to say why these people stay.” “Maybe they think they will get more land,” he added. “Maybe they think they won’t get a better opportunity.” The death toll stood at 152 on Monday, with 300 missing. With no hope of finding survivors, teams used backhoes and bulldozers to move the tons of earth that buried the neighborhood. The intermittent rain and the erosion caused by the rising Pinula River posed a threat to the recovery teams. A new temporary morgue was set up, and the Red Cross sent out an appeal for dry ice. Above, the town center of this gritty suburb of Guatemala City was hushed, the crowds of mourners and others that had packed the streets a day earlier had disappeared. Funeral processions made their way in and out of the town cemetery where workers had made space for new crypts. As the disaster preparedness teams zigzagged through a small settlement of about 15 houses, families who thought they would stay became rattled. Many people approached, asking for advice, although there was little to be had. But some decided not to leave until they were forced to do so. “I’ve lived here all my life,” said Fabia Alonzo, 23. “We couldn’t get this house elsewhere.” Her husband’s grandmother, Gregoria García, 85, explained the problem echoed by many families here. “I really don’t know where we’d go,” she said. “We’re poor.” Mr. Barillas, the pastor, also vowed to stay. “I have my fruit trees and I leave a simple, peaceful life,” he said. “Where would I go?”",

    "source": "Portugal, Missing Deadline for Novo Banco Sale, Turns to Second Bidder <eos> MADRID — Portugal is having trouble selling the bank salvaged from the wreckage of one of the country’s biggest private lenders. The Portuguese central bank on Tuesday missed its own deadline for selling Novo Banco, the salvaged entity, after talks with the leading bidder faltered. The Bank of Portugal did not identify the bidder, but it has been widely reported to be a Chinese insurance and asset management company. The central bank said that it would begin negotiations with a second bidder, which the Portuguese news media have identified as the American private equity firm Apollo Global Management. The firm declined to comment on Tuesday. The auction of Novo Banco is meant to complete Portugal’s restructuring and rescue of Banco Espírito Santo, which required a state-led bailout in August 2014 of 4.9 billion euros, or $5.5 billion at current exchange rates. The rescue occurred after the bank was forced to disclose unsustainable losses linked to loans it had made to other companies in the Espírito Santo family business empire. Under the bailout, the Portuguese authorities decided to break up the bank and transfer the healthy assets to a new entity, Novo Banco. The plan was to then auction Novo Banco to private investors and to recover as much of the cost of the bailout as possible. Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho, who is seeking re-election on Oct. 4, has indicated that his coalition government wanted to complete the sale of Novo Banco as soon as possible. Image As part of a bailout of Banco Espírito Santo, the Portuguese authorities decided to break up the bank and transfer the healthy assets to a new entity, Novo Banco. Credit Hugo Correia/Reuters Banco Espírito Santo was at the heart of a complex web of family-owned companies with investments that stretched from mining projects in Angola to hotels in Portugal. The bank, led by Ricardo Espírito Santo Silva Salgado , executive chairman and the great-grandson of the founder of the family business, was increasingly used as a lender of last resort for other companies in the conglomerate. That also helped the group and its subsidiaries mask their financial problems and issue more debt to other investors. As the family group’s problems mounted, Mr. Salgado stepped down in July 2014 and was then arrested and ordered to post bail of €3 million, as part of a separate money laundering and tax evasion investigation. He was subsequently put under house arrest, pending a trial. Separately, the central bank has accused Mr. Salgado and other officials of his bank of mismanagement and concealing information when they sold debt to investors without disclosing existing losses. This summer, the Portuguese central bank made a short list of three bidders for Novo Banco, without identifying them. It then entered into exclusive talks with the highest bidder, with a view to closing the deal by the end of August. When the central bank made that list, the Portuguese news media, citing officials and bankers involved in the auction, said that a Chinese company, the Anbang Insurance Group, had made the highest offer, followed by Apollo Global Management. Fosun International, another Chinese insurance and asset management company, was reported to have been third. The collapse of Banco Espírito Santo was a blow not only to Portugal’s banking sector but also to the reputation of the government and the central bank, because it occurred only months after the country emerged from a €78 billion, three-year international bailout program. Portugal, Greece and Ireland were among the countries hit hardest in the eurozone’s sovereign debt crisis . The continued difficulties of Novo Banco, linked to the investments and unchecked lending activities of Banco Espiríto Santo, have been seen as an impediment to Portugal’s securing a high auction price for the institution. On Monday evening, Novo Banco reported a first-half loss of almost €252 million, mostly because of the cost of writing off interest payments from big corporate loans inherited from Banco Espiríto Santo. Novo Banco also had to state provisions for the loss of value in some of its telecommunications holdings.",

    "source": "Fewer Latino Immigrants Sending Money Home <eos> In a sign that the economic downturn is hitting hard among Latino immigrants, more than three million of them stopped sending money to families in their home countries during the last two years, the Inter-American Development Bank said on Wednesday. Growing numbers of Latino immigrants are also considering giving up their foothold in the United States and returning home in response to a slump in low-wage jobs and the crackdown on illegal immigration , the bank reported in a survey of 5,000 immigrants from Latin America. The survey found that only half of the 18.9 million Latino immigrants in this country now send money regularly to relatives in their home countries, compared with 73 percent two years ago. “The major dynamic that is holding them back from sending money is fear,” said Sergio Bendixen, a Miami-based pollster who conducted the survey. “They don’t know whether they won’t be able to get a job anymore.” With fewer people sending money home, money transfers to some Latin American countries have started to decline, reversing five years of often spectacular growth. In the first quarter of this year, transfers to Mexico dropped 2.9 percent from the first quarter of 2007, Mexico’s central bank reported on Wednesday, the first significant decline since Mexico began tracking the transfers in 1995. For Latin America as a whole, the amount of the money transfers, which are known as remittances, remained virtually flat over the last two years, the development bank reported. It estimated total remittances to the region at $45.9 billion in 2008, an increase of $500 million over 2006. That contrasts with the period from 2001 to 2006, when the amount of remittances to the region tripled, to $45 billion from $15 billion, according to figures from the development bank, a multilateral organization based in Washington that finances development projects in Latin America. Total remittances did not drop more sharply in the last two years because those immigrants who continued to send money sent larger amounts more frequently, the bank’s survey found. “The longstanding pattern of increasing numbers of Latin American immigrants sending increasing amounts of money back home has stopped,” said Donald F. Terry, the general manager of the Multilateral Investment Fund at the development bank and the official in charge of the survey. The survey was conducted in Spanish from Feb. 9 to 23, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 1 percentage point. With lower income and less job security, Latino immigrants said they were spending or saving their money here rather than sending it to support children, spouses and parents at home. Latino immigrants said life had become more difficult for them here. Of those interviewed, 81 percent said it is harder to find a good-paying job. Almost 40 percent said they were earning less this year than the previous year. The largest group of immigrants in the survey — 18 percent — worked in construction, which has been especially hard hit in the slowdown. As a result of the difficulties, among immigrants who had been here less than five years, 49 percent said they were thinking of returning home, while 41 percent said they planned to remain in the United States. Over all, slightly under one-third of the immigrants said they were thinking of leaving this country. In 2001, the last time a similar survey asked a comparable question, about 20 percent of Latino immigrants said they were thinking of going home, said Mr. Bendixen, who conducted that survey as well. However, Mr. Bendixen said that immigrant workers who participated in focus groups as part of the survey said they were not ready to leave the United States quite yet. Before taking the drastic step of moving back home, immigrants said they were taking jobs at lower wages or sometimes working two jobs to try to maintain their income, he said. “These are resourceful people who will do whatever job is available,” Mr. Bendixen said. The economic pressure appears to have fallen equally on illegal immigrants and those authorized to be in the United States. Of the immigrants interviewed in the survey, 47 percent said they did not have legal status. The others were legal immigrants and American citizens. A large majority of those surveyed — legal and illegal — said they experienced increasing hostility as a result of efforts to curb illegal immigration and punish employers who hire unauthorized immigrant workers. In the survey, 61 percent of Latinos who were American citizens and 66 percent of those who were legal immigrants said discrimination had become a major problem for them. In an interview in Phoenix on Wednesday, Yolanda, a 45-year-old illegal immigrant from Mexico who did not participate in the survey, said that she had started to think of going home, after 13 years in the United States. Before November, she was sending at least $400 a month to Mexico City to support her three children. This year she can manage only $300 every two months, she said. Yolanda, who asked that her last name not be published because of her immigration status, said her trouble stemmed from the crackdown on hiring of illegal immigrants, fewer jobs and higher prices. “We can’t keep up with expenses and also send money,” she said in Spanish. “If you can’t even eat, what’s the point? This is the worst it’s been, because we’ve never not had enough for food and our bills.” Mexico, which received $24.7 billion in remittances last year, will be hardest hit by the decrease. The majority of the families of an estimated 3.2 million immigrants who will no longer receive transfers are in Mexico, Mr. Terry, the bank official, said.",

    "source": "Drone Strikes in Yemen Said to Set a Dangerous Precedent <eos> WASHINGTON — An investigation of American drone strikes in Yemen concludes that the Obama administration has not followed its own rules to avoid civilian casualties and is setting a dangerous example for other countries that want to use unmanned aircraft against terrorists. The study , by the Open Society Justice Initiative , a legal advocacy group based in New York, was released on Monday at a time when Yemen has been engulfed in violence and American drone strikes have been slowed or halted. But its observations about the performance of American counterterrorism strikes from 2012 to 2014 remain relevant for assessing a novel weapons system that the United States has used in several countries and has now approved for export to a limited number of allies. Despite promises of greater openness about drone strikes, the Obama administration has continued to guard their secrecy closely and says nothing publicly about strike targets and results. The resulting information vacuum has been partly filled by independent studies by groups like the Open Society Justice Initiative, which worked with the Mwatana Organization for Human Rights , a Yemeni group that interviewed witnesses. In May 2013, in a long-planned speech on the targeted killing of terrorists , President Obama described a rigorous standard that he said guided all drone strikes. “Before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured — the highest standard we can set,” he said. Mr. Obama said that some civilian casualties were unavoidable, adding, “For me, and those in my chain of command, those deaths will haunt us as long as we live.” But the new report questions how careful the strikes have been, based on the analysis of nine strikes in Yemen, where strikes are carried out by both the C.I.A. and the military’s Joint Special Operations Command. Each of those strikes killed civilians, the study found, with a total of 26 civilians killed, including five children, and 13 others injured. “We’ve found evidence that President Obama’s standard is not being met on the ground,” said Amrit Singh, a senior legal officer at the Open Society Justice Initiative and a primary author of the report. “There’s a real question about whether the near-certainty standard is being applied in practice.” Asked about the report’s findings, a National Security Council spokesman, Ned Price, said that he was “not in a position to comment on specific cases” because of secrecy rules, but that the standard Mr. Obama described in 2013 was still in place. “In those rare instances in which it appears noncombatants may have been killed or injured, after-action reviews have been conducted to determine why,” he said, adding that condolence payments were sometimes given to those injured and families of those killed. Mr. Price said administration officials “continue to work diligently toward” the goal of greater transparency. The military announced strikes against Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria, as well as recent strikes in Somalia, but no information has been released on strikes in Pakistan or Yemen. The Open Society report also questions whether the administration is acting on its stated policy of always capturing terrorists when “feasible” rather than killing them. In two of the strikes it studied, the researchers quoted witnesses as saying the targeted individuals, who had been identified by American intelligence as members of Al Qaeda, could easily have been arrested by the Yemeni authorities. Saudi-Backed Forces Gain Momentum Annotated maps showing the Houthi rebels’ drive south, U.S. airstrikes and historical divisions. An American official, speaking about the classified operations on the condition of anonymity, said that in some cases a foreign government “only has the most tenuous reach into parts of its territory” and that capture operations “would pose profound risks to our forces.” But the official noted that foreign partners often capture and imprison terrorism suspects based on American intelligence. Drones loaded with Hellfire missiles and other munitions were first used by the United States in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and became an integral part of the American wars there and in Iraq. There were sporadic strikes against militants in Pakistan until mid-2008, when President George W. Bush sharply escalated the drone campaign there. Mr. Obama stepped up strikes in Pakistan further and expanded them to Yemen and Somalia early in his presidency. The pace of strikes has slowed, however, and is well below the peak in 2010 in Pakistan and 2012 in Yemen. Advocates of drone strikes argue that they are particularly suited for pursuing small groups of terrorists and that they kill far fewer civilians than conventional airstrikes or ground troops. American officials often assert that accounts of civilian deaths by independent groups are exaggerated, but they rarely give their own account of who was killed. “This program has no public disclosure about who’s being killed and why, and there’s no public accountability,” Ms. Singh, the report’s author, said. “If you insulate a program with secrecy, you prevent information that could correct it from coming to light.” In the most recent strike analyzed by the Open Society report, in April 2014, two drones fired on a Toyota Land Cruiser outside the town of Bayda. The report concludes that the men in the Land Cruiser, all of whom were killed, were indeed Qaeda fighters. But shrapnel from the strike hit 12 laborers in a Toyota Hilux just ahead of the Land Cruiser. Four of them were killed and five more injured, the report found, based on interviews with survivors. Based on negotiations between tribal leaders and the Yemeni government, the government paid about $55,000 in compensation and 30 Kalashnikov rifles, costs that Yemeni officials have said are generally covered by the United States. Another strike in the same province in September 2012, the report found, killed 12 people and injured two others as they rode a truck home after selling their wares in a town market. The victims included a pregnant woman and her 10-year-old daughter, as well as 15- and 17-year-old boys. The researchers found no evidence of Qaeda connections among those killed. Local news reports said the intended target was a local Qaeda leader who was not present. Again, the government compensated the affected families with cash and weapons. But the fear of strikes from the drones that regularly patrolled the skies lingered. “We live in constant fear,” the report quoted an anonymous survivor as saying. “There is no assurance that we would not be the next targets.” The brother of one of those killed was quoted as declaring, “The U.S. government should come to the region to see what targets it has hit.” Ms. Singh said, “The voices of these individuals have not been heard by the U.S. government, because no one is going over to Yemen and asking what happened.” The C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan, said at his confirmation hearing in 2013 that he believed that the United States should publicly acknowledge unintended civilian deaths in counterterrorism strikes. But it has never happened. For years, arms experts have been concerned about the example set by the United States for other countries as armed drones proliferate. Drones have been used to fire missiles by Israel and Britain as well as by the United States, but many other countries are seeking to develop or buy them. In February, in response to pressure from arms manufacturers and many countries, the Obama administration announced rules governing the export of armed drones. A State Department fact sheet said the rules required “all sales and transfers to include agreement to principles for proper use.”",

    "source": "For Federer, His Ranking and His Age Are Nothing but Numbers <eos> TORONTO — Roger Federer arrived at the Rogers Cup under unfamiliar circumstances. It marked his first tournament since Wimbledon, since turning 29, since hiring Paul Annacone as his new coach. This is also the first tournament since November 2003 in which Federer entered as the third seed. But Federer disagreed Monday with the notion of his imminent decline. “Being ranked No. 3 in the world is something I haven’t been in a very long time,” he said. “So it gives me motivation and a drive to come forward again.” All great athletes, even Federer, get older. Federer himself acknowledges he is no longer the player who captured 11 of 16 Grand Slam championships from 2004 to 2007. He knows, as well as anyone, that the last player 29 or older to win at a Grand Slam was Andre Agassi, at 32, at the 2003 Australian Open. Federer has not won a singles title since the Australian Open. And after 23 straight appearances in Grand Slam semifinals, he fell in — gasp — the quarterfinals at the French Open and Wimbledon. For most players, those results in one calendar year of Grand Slam tournaments — a title and two quarterfinal appearances — would constitute progress. But Federer is not most players, never has been. Practice time has been an issue. The lung infection he had in February kept Federer off the court, and he struggled through back and leg injuries during Wimbledon. Federer said he did not watch the Wimbledon final while it was happening, instead heading with his family on a luxury cruise through the Mediterranean. When they returned, he brought Annacone on board as another coach. Federer respected the work that Annacone did with Pete Sampras and Tim Henman. “The goal has always been for me to improve, and I won’t just be happy playing the same way for years and years and years,” he said. The last time he entered a tournament as the No. 3 seed was in Houston in 2003. He won that tournament, beating Agassi in the final, which boosted him one spot in the rankings, which preceded his long reign at No. 1. The top seeds here receive a bye into the second round, in which Federer will face the veteran Juan Ignacio Chela. Looming is a potential quarterfinal matchup with Tomas Berdych, who knocked Federer out of Wimbledon before losing to Rafael Nadal in the final . The field here includes 16 of the top 20 ranked players. Federer insisted he remained unconcerned with numbers — particularly 29 and 3. He said he never noticed he had fallen in the rankings until he glanced at them one day and saw his name third. “It doesn’t change my life,” he said. But there is no doubt that his life is changing, be it the first birthday of his twin girls recently, or his tennis struggles of the past seven months. Here, with a new coach in the fold, he will begin another comeback.",

    "source": "Food Cart Offerings Are Exotic and Affordable <eos> BY 11 a.m. most weekdays, lunchtime aromas are already wafting up Cedar Street opposite Yale New Haven Hospital . And we’re not talking hot dogs. Oh, you can find franks and fries and other American basics, but they are in the minority on this block, where an international lineup of food carts offers specialties from Africa, Europe, the far, near and Middle East and South and Central America — all at prices that rarely run more than $5 or $6 (cash only) for a huge serving. Think Latino arepas, Korean bibimbap and boolgogi, Middle Eastern falafel, Ethiopian injera and spicy lentils, Indian chicken tiki masala, Pad Thai and Japanese teppanyaki. There are soups, sushi (cooked or vegetable only — no raw fish), several versions of burritos, halal-certified meat and loads of vegetarian dishes. “It’s a way to explore without spending a whole lot of money,” said Karyn Bailey, a social worker in an autism clinic, who says she has been coming to the carts once a week for the last 10 years, trying new foods. “I like the variety and the price is right.” This day it is Moroccan food, her first time at a relatively new cart called Mediterranean. There are more than 150 food carts licensed in New Haven, but the largest concentrations (nearly three dozen) are outside the hospital and the Yale School of Medicine They are well known to members of the medical community, who throng into the streets, rain or shine, year-round, to wait on lunch lines that can be 20 deep, but unknown in other parts of town. Maggie Wei, her customary large red bandana wrapped around her forehead, buzzes around the diminutive kitchen in her enclosed pushcart — at 12 years, it is the oldest of three Peking Edo carts she and her husband own here. “My cart’s pretty much like an international spot,” said Ms. Wei, who is Taiwanese. “This is Singapore noodles and that’s a Taiwanese miso soup, Malaysia-style curry chicken, barbecued pork, and I have a grilled chicken,” she said pointing out a few. “I also do a lot of vegetables. So today I have a mustard greens with ginger.” But Ms. Wei did not have to ask Masaaki Torii, who works in the nearby neurobiology lab, what he wanted. He has been a daily customer for five years, and she knows his usual is rice noodle soup with barbecued pork; for his wife, Mr. Torii gets white rice with a ground pork stew with tofu, hard-boiled egg and spicy sauce. As far as anyone can remember, the hospital cart community started more than 20 years ago, but it has increased so rapidly in the last few years that the city agencies responsible for licensing carts have decided on rules requiring, among other things, that carts be at least 15 feet from one another and that locations be assigned to vendors based on how long they have been operating there. The regulations, expected to go into effect on May 1, are aimed at easing sidewalk congestion and minimizing the scramble for prime spots nearest the hospital. “What we’re trying to do here is to do something about the chaos over there,” said Andy Rizzo, a buildings official and fan of cart cuisine who did two similar reconfigurations for smaller groups of carts near the Peabody Museum and at Long Wharf. “We need to do something about traffic, the sidewalk issues — God forbid someone in a wheelchair has to get down the street.” Vendors pay $200 a year for a vending permit, and $280 to the Health Department for a yearly license and inspection. All but the most basic vendors must take a one-day class. Cart food must be prepared on the cart or in a commercial kitchen. Those who also operate restaurants typically bring prepared food to a cart equipped to keep it at a proper temperature. At Chinese Food Healthy Way, a hospital-street cart for 14 years, Melissa Chang serves dozens of dishes that originated in her family’s restaurant, China Garden. David Jadney, a sales representative who calls on the hospital twice a week, orders General Tso’s chicken with brown rice and doesn’t have to tell Ms. Chang to go easy on the hot sauce. “Two drops,” she says. Mr. Jadney said his visits always include lunch at the carts. “I work with folks that work in New York City and they call on Columbia, Mount Sinai, and when they come here they say this is so much better than New York,” he said. “The varieties, the prices — they say this is just great.” Once you are in the vicinity, the sizzling aromas are hard to resist. Many vendors have mini-kitchens with propane-fueled grills and griddles for stir-frying Asian noodles, toasting arepas or frying eggs for the Korean bibimbap, a rice and meat dish with egg on top. Jon’s Lunch, one of the oldest carts, serves sausage-and-pepper and cheese steak subs among its mainly American food offerings. Jon Roy, the owner, buys meat fresh each morning and arrives around 8:30 a.m. to start slow-cooking a large pot of it for his sloppy Joes. “Everything’s speed out here,” he said throwing huge sausage pieces onto the griddle. “People only have a certain amount of time.” In a line at Tijuana Taco Company, 16 people deep, customers take the wait in stride as a lone cart operator prepares each burrito individually. “These are super burritos. The corn relish that he puts in there is really terrific,” said Rick Shiffman, a professor of pediatrics. “You know what’s amazing? They write nothing down. They take about 10 orders. They get them all right. I don’t know how they do it.” Suzette Franco-Camacho and her husband, Arturo, started the Taco Company carts in 1996 before they opened any of their highly rated restaurants (Roomba, Bespoke, Sabor — all now closed or sold) or made plans to open two new ones. Ms. Franco-Camacho admitted that the carts added another obligation to the already tough restaurant business, but that she and her husband felt a loyalty to customers. “Personally I think the carts are awesome,” she said. “The whole culture of cart food — it makes food accessible to people who can’t afford to come down to the restaurant.” “It all just brings the level of food up,” she added. “If your street food is good, your brick and mortar food had better be good.”",

    "source": "Timeline Provides Details for a Grisly Crime Against a Teacher <eos> DANVERS, Mass. — On the morning of Oct. 22, Philip Chism, a 14-year-old student and soccer player, took a ski mask, gloves, multiple changes of clothes and a box-cutter with him to school, according to the police. Mr. Chism was later seen in surveillance videos from cameras at Danvers High School putting on the gloves and pulling the hood of a sweatshirt over his head as he followed his math teacher, Colleen Ritzer, 24, into a school bathroom, the police said in court papers released Friday. Shortly thereafter, the video showed him rolling a recycling bin into the bathroom and leaving, this time wearing a white T-shirt and a black mask. By the end of the day, Ms. Ritzer had been raped, and stabbed multiple times. Her throat was slit. Her body had been dumped into nearby woods; next to it was a folded, handwritten note saying, “I hate you all.” Mr. Chism has been indicted on charges of murder, aggravated rape and armed robbery. He is to be arraigned in Essex Superior Court on Dec. 4. The court papers provide a timeline and details of a gruesome crime that has shaken this quiet suburb, about 20 miles north of Boston. And they offer a few clues about Mr. Chism’s life: his parents had been undergoing what his mother called a “stressful” divorce, for example. But they do not address the central question of why a young man like Mr. Chism, who apparently showed no outward signs of trouble or aggression, might have mutilated, raped and murdered his teacher, who was beloved by most of her students and went out of her way to help them. Image Philip Chism, with officers at his arraignment last month, may have planned the killing of his math teacher, Colleen Ritzer, based on what he took to school, a state trooper has said. Credit Pool photo by Patrick Whittemore Dr. Eugene Beresin, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in adolescent psychiatry at the Clay Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, said such cases were “off-the-charts rare.” “I personally have never seen anything like this in the hundreds of cases I’ve had and the thousands of cases I’ve supervised,” he said. He has not been involved in the case and is not privy to any information that might help connect the dots here, and he said it was hard for him to make any sense of it. “Most kids who commit violent acts have a history, a history of something, of impulsivity, of mood disorders, or of abuse and neglect,” Dr. Beresin said. “I see kids every day who have witnessed the most horrifying sexual and physical abuse, for example, or have been abused themselves, but they don’t do this.” Any number of internal factors, such as a percolating psychosis or a neurological condition, or external factors, such as abuse, could be involved, he said. It is also possible, he added, that a motive may never be discerned. Robert C. LaBarge Jr., a state trooper, wrote in the court papers released Friday that he believed Mr. Chism “planned the crime” because he went to school “armed with a box-cutter, a balaclava/ski mask, gloves” and several changes of clothes. Mr. Chism was a student in Ms. Ritzer’s last-period class that day. An unidentified student told the police that after class, she was in Ms. Ritzer’s classroom and saw the teacher and Mr. Chism there talking about China. The student said that Ms. Ritzer then mentioned Tennessee, the state Mr. Chism left a few months before with his mother, and that Mr. Chism “became visibly upset.” She said that at first, Ms. Ritzer did not seem aware that Mr. Chism was upset but then realized he was and changed the subject. Image The body of Ms. Ritzer, 24, was found in the woods near the school where she taught math. Credit Lawrence Eagle-Tribune, via Associated Press The unidentified student also said “she observed Philip apparently talking to himself in the classroom,” the court papers said. The video cameras — now a staple in newly built schools like this one — showed Ms. Ritzer walking out of her classroom and down a hallway toward a women’s bathroom at 2:54 p.m. At the same time, Mr. Chism walked into the hallway, then ducked back into the classroom. He then emerged from the classroom with a hood over his head and went into the same bathroom, pulling on the gloves. At 3:07, he left the bathroom with a hood over his head. He went outside to the student parking lot and came back in the building at 3:09 wearing a white T-shirt. He went back to the classroom and emerged at 3:11 with a red hooded sweatshirt over his head and returned to the bathroom at 3:16 with a recycling bin. At 3:22, he emerged in a white T-shirt and a black mask, pulling the bin and heading toward an elevator and then outside. Video picked him up coming back into the school at 4:00. By 4:04, he was seen wearing a black shirt and glasses and carrying a pair of jeans. A minute later, he went back to the original bathroom, then left the school a minute after that. After the police were notified that both student and teacher were missing, they conducted a search. At 12:30 the next morning, the police found Mr. Chism walking on a nearby highway. He had a knife and a bloodstained box-cutter, they said. Asked where the blood came from, Mr. Chism said, “The girl,” according to the court papers. They also found Ms. Ritzer’s credit cards, driver’s license and underwear in his backpack, they said, then placed him under arrest and charged him with murder, to which he later pleaded not guilty. At that point, the police went to look for her body. They found it, half-naked, near the school, covered with leaves and debris. A recycling bin was nearby, as were blood-soaked gloves. Trooper LaBarge wrote that he was seeking warrants to search Mr. Chism’s apartment, where he lived with his mother and two sisters, and his computers. He said that based on prior experience, he knew that people involved in violent crimes “often will have an obsession and this obsession can include Internet searches for their victims and sexual-fetish-based Internet inquiries.” He also said he expected to find “documents describing planning the crime, the defendant’s mental status, and any nexus for the reason the defendant expressed his hate for everyone as described in the note found adjacent to the victim’s body.” The results of those searches have not been made public.",

    "source": "British Grandmother Sentenced to Death for Smuggling Cocaine Into Bali <eos> JAKARTA, Indonesia — An Indonesian court sentenced a 56-year-old British woman to death on Tuesday for smuggling $2.5 million worth of cocaine onto the island of Bali, a decision that went far beyond the prosecutors’ recommendation of 15 years in prison. In May, according to investigators, customs officials at Bali’s airport discovered 8.4 pounds of cocaine hidden in the lining of the travel bag carried by the woman, Lindsay June Sandiford. A grandmother, she said she was forced to take the drugs into the country by a gang that had threatened to hurt one of her children. Dismissing the prosecutors’ call for a prison term, judges at the Denpasar District Court decided on death after finding that Ms. Sandiford, by ferrying in the drugs, had damaged the image of Bali as a tourism destination and weakened the government’s drug prevention program. Television footage showed Ms. Sandiford sobbing. She is expected to appeal. The British Embassy said, “Britain remains strongly opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances.” Image Lindsay Sandiford was arrested at the Bali airport last May after cocaine was found in her suitcase. Credit Made Nagi/European Pressphoto Agency Indonesia, known for its tough treatment of people who commit drug offenses and other crimes, has put five foreigners to death in drug cases since 1998. Forty foreigners are on death row for drug and other offenses. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has granted clemency to four prisoners on death row for narcotics crimes. Some analysts said the judges might have been motivated to issue the harshest possible sentence in the Sandiford case because the president’s decision to reduce the sentences of 19 drug convicts in October stirred a public backlash. “It’s possible that could have influenced the thinking of the judges,” David McRae, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Australia, said in an e-mail. “On the other hand, it’s not unheard-of for sentences to exceed, even significantly exceed, the prosecutor’s sentencing request.” Douglas Ramage, an analyst with Bower Group Asia, said the sentence was in keeping with Indonesian precedent. “Foreigners and Indonesians alike have been regularly sentenced to the death penalty, so in a sense, Lindsay was not treated appreciably different than others who have come before Indonesian courts on drug trafficking charges,” he said. A Briton accused of serving as Ms. Sandiford’s accomplice, Anthony Pounder, is expected to be sentenced on Wednesday.",

    "source": "Postseason Pressure a Pleasure to La Russa <eos> ST. LOUIS — In the last few days, Tony La Russa , the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals , has repeatedly invoked the word fun to describe the happenings around his team during its unlikely run to the playoffs. That may seem uncharacteristic coming from a manager who has come to be known as something of a stone-faced thinker. But it also seems to reveal something about his character. The Cardinals’ division series with the Philadelphia Phillies has turned into another opportunity for La Russa, who seems to derive atypical satisfaction from the thick heat of competition, to flourish in his own idiosyncratic manner. “In a kind of perverse way, it’s fun to compete against the Phillies, because you’re seeing the best,” La Russa said of the series, now tied at 1-1. “There’s nobody better.” Over his 33 years leading three different clubs, La Russa has amassed 2,728 victories, 2 World Series championships and a reputation as one who helped popularize a tinkering style of managing. His players mostly insist that La Russa’s public persona does not match his private demeanor. “He’s totally different from the inside than he is from the outside looking in,” Lance Berkman said. “I know what I thought of him when I played against him, and I know what I think about him now, and it’s just totally different than you would expect.” Berkman added, “He’s not an overbearing guy.” There remains plenty of evidence otherwise. The Cardinals’ win over the Phillies in Game 2 on Sunday, for instance, seemed a quintessential La Russa performance, full of subtle calculation and bold action. In the second inning, La Russa went onto the field to talk to his struggling starter, Chris Carpenter, and lingered there in what appeared to be a predetermined ploy to draw Jerry Meals, the home plate umpire, to the mound. La Russa acknowledged Monday that he said a few words to Meals while on the field, but played down the significance. “I didn’t go very far at all, not at all, because you can get ejected,” La Russa said. He was substantially more verbose, though, in a live midgame interview broadcast on national television, during which he criticized Meals’s umpiring in a game in which the Cardinals were trying to rally against the formidable Cliff Lee. Almost unprompted, La Russa said: “Well, what I would add is — it’ll get me in trouble, but I’ll do it, anyway — is they’re pitching to two different strike zones. And against a good club, or any club, that’s not an advantage you want to give.” General Manager John Mozeliak said Monday afternoon that the team had received a call from the commissioner’s office on Sunday night, but that he was unaware of any fines or reprimands. Whether La Russa’s message to Meals had any effect is unclear. More tangible was the manner in which La Russa tiptoed through the final six innings of the game, pulling off a high-wire act that yielded a vital victory for the Cardinals, who were behind by 4-0 after two innings. After pulling Carpenter for a pinch-hitter in the top of the fourth, La Russa passed on using a long reliever, though he had Jake Westbrook available, and used six pitchers to close out the game. In the eighth inning, he used four relievers to face four batters, hopping in and out of the dugout each time to a round of loud boos from the Philadelphia crowd. “Every manager’s got their own style, and his has obviously worked for him,” said Marc Rzepczynski, who entered the game in the seventh. “With his style, you know he will use the pen, you know he’s not afraid to throw us out there in any situation, and late in the game, offensively as well, he’s willing to do anything.” La Russa, who turns 67 on Tuesday, has declined to discuss his plans when his current contract expires at the end of the year. Wherever he ends up, he is likely to remain a man in perpetual motion, looking for his idea of fun. “I just think he’s passionate about the game,” Berkman said. “You can tell that he really lives and dies by the competition.”",

    "source": "Lindsey Vonn Misses Gate as Maria Riesch Wins Women’s Slalom <eos> WHISTLER, British Columbia — Lindsey Vonn completed her last race of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics with shoulders slumped, slowly sliding sideways on the snow after missing a gate in the women’s slalom Friday. It was a far cry from the Vonn who had been a streaking blur nine days earlier in the downhill, when she crossed the finish line with arms raised, the first American woman to win the event . Within minutes, though, Vonn had absorbed her slalom slip-up and stood at the finish area again, smiling broadly as snowflakes settled in her hair and goggles. It had been a whirlwind two weeks — if not six months — for Vonn, and when she removed her skis and walked to a quiet area beneath the massive Olympic scoreboard, her emotions were a mix of pride, reflection and relief. “I’m happy with everything I’ve done here,” she said. “Maybe a little more broken and bruised than when I came here, but I’m happy. Things happened here that I’ll remember forever.” Most surprising, she was already talking about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. And beyond. “I will most definitely be back for the next Olympics,” she said. “It’s not that far off. I heard a rumor that Denver might try to get the 2018 Olympics, and if that happens, maybe I’ll be a five-time Olympian.” Vonn , 25, won a bronze medal in the super-G at these Games to go with her gold medal in the downhill. She had the lead halfway through the super combined, but charging after a second gold, she crashed and fell. The results were similar in the slalom, won by Maria Riesch of Germany, and in Wednesday’s giant slalom, when she broke her pinkie while slamming into a fence. Both events have been a struggle for Vonn all winter, especially after a Feb. 2 shin injury wiped out nearly all of her training. “I have learned so much in the last few months and even the last two weeks,” Vonn said. “I feel like I’ve grown up 10 years. There is no way to know how you will react when you stand in the start house of an Olympic race and you know that millions of people are watching and expecting you to win. “But at the end of the day, I learned it’s just a race. I handled the pressure and that’s going to be very useful next time. I know I can do it again.” Vonn said her finger injury had no effect on her skiing Friday, and she long ago tired of talking about the injury to her right shin that had been such prominent news on the eve of the Olympics. “There were some crazy moments here, but there were plenty of cool moments,” she said. “Things didn’t work out perfectly, but they rarely do. I might have done better, but I did my best. Winning a gold medal was my dream and I did that in the first race. I skied well in the super combined and might have been able to win a medal there, but I went for the gold when it was there to win. I skied pretty well in the super-G. “I look back and I’m proud,” she added. “I went down fighting.” Vonn said she would attend the closing ceremony Sunday and maybe another Olympic event or two on Saturday. In a few days, she will fly to Europe, where she will resume the defense of her World Cup overall title. In this season’s standings, she narrowly leads Riesch , who won her second gold medal Friday. Marlies Schild of Austria was 0.43 of a second behind Riesch to win the slalom silver medal, and Sarka Zahrobska of the Czech Republic was third. “It’s been an amazing Olympics for me,” Vonn said. “An amazing Olympics for a lot of American Olympians. But it might be fun to get back to a normal routine.” She stopped to climb over a fence and hug her mother, Linda Krohn, who waited just beyond the finish line. Krohn said: “It’s hard to live a whole year of your life with all of it pointing toward five races that might take 10 minutes. She should be very proud of how she handled that. I know I am.” Vonn was asked if she felt strange talking about the next Olympics already. She laughed, but there was little stress in her expression when she said she was looking forward to 2014. “Things happen that can only happen at the Olympics, and I’ve known that since I was a little girl,” she said. “The day I won my gold medal was the most amazing day of my life. I only wish it had lasted a little longer.” Vonn lifted her skis to her shoulder, taking her last few steps off the mountain. “These Olympics went by so fast,” she said. “Time flies when you’re having fun.”",

    "source": "Wizards Expect Paul Pierce to Lead Way <eos> After spending the first 15 seasons of his N.B.A. career with the Boston Celtics, Paul Pierce has become a hired gun in the league, a sort of big-money consultant acquired to impart championship wisdom to some less-enlightened group. Last season he swaggered into Brooklyn after a trade to the Nets and began touting the team’s trophy ambitions with the type of reckless charisma the organization desperately lacked at the time. This week it was a familiar script with a new team. “When I look at the Eastern Conference, we can be right up there with the rest of the them,” Pierce said of the Washington Wizards , who signed him to a two-year, $10.8 million contract over the summer, after the Nets declined to re-sign him. “I think we match up well with pretty much anybody in the East — and not only the East, the entire N.B.A.” Wizards Coach Randy Wittman pointed out that Pierce, 37, a potential Hall of Famer, is the only one in his locker room with a championship ring. The Wizards are young, talented and seeking to believe in themselves. Pierce is confidence personified. Three minutes into an interview with a few reporters Wednesday morning at Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks later beat the Wizards in a preseason game , Pierce decided that he was done answering questions, got up from his chair, put on his sunglasses and walked away. His teammates were happy to speak on his behalf. “I love his fighting spirit,” center Marcin Gortat said of Pierce. “We still need to keep building chemistry, but hopefully he’s the guy that can bring us to the finals.” That a Wizards player can mention the N.B.A. finals as a season goal, that he can do so and not be dismissed as delusional, is a testament to how the club thinks of itself after improvements in the past year or so. After a 29-53 record in the 2012-13 season, the Wizards won 44 games last season and took the Indiana Pacers to six games before exiting in the second round of the playoffs. Much of the turnaround was attributed to the continued emergence of point guard John Wall, 24, who missed a chunk of the 29-win season with a knee injury. Last season, his fourth in the league, he averaged 19.3 points and 8.8 assists a game and was named to his first All-Star team. The Wizards, then, no longer have the benefit of their opponents’ disregard. In the league’s annual preseason survey of teams’ general managers, more than half of those polled picked Washington to win the Southeast division. The Cleveland Cavaliers, retooled around LeBron James, and the Chicago Bulls, revitalized with a healthy Derrick Rose, are the obvious favorites in the East, but the Wizards have become the popular third choice. “We’re not going to be the surprise team of the conference anymore because of last year,” said Gortat, who averaged 13.2 points, 9.5 rebounds and 1.5 blocked shots per game last season, his first with the Wizards. The Wizards’ confidence this week was tinged with caution, with several players bringing up the group’s current glut of injuries as an early hurdle. The team is most concerned about Bradley Beal, 21, a talented shooting guard who fractured his left wrist in a preseason game this month and could be sidelined until December. Beal averaged 17.1 points per game last season, his second in the league, and settled in during the playoffs alongside Wall to form one of the more sparkling backcourt partnerships in the league. On top of the injuries, four players, including Nene and DeJuan Blair, will serve one-game suspensions to start the season for leaving the bench in a preseason game altercation. “We know that we got off to a slow start last year, and we can’t do that again,” Wall said. “So we’re already focused and locked in and trying to hold the fort down until those other guys come back.” Pierce, who averaged 13.5 points in 28 minutes per game last season with the Nets, will be central to that effort. It was the sudden exit of small forward Trevor Ariza that precipitated Pierce’s move to Washington. Pierce, at the late stage of his career, falls short of the multifaceted skills of Ariza. But Wittman noted that the team has not had a small forward like Pierce, who can score in so many ways, since Wittman joined the Wizards’ coaching staff as an assistant in 2009. On top of his scoring prowess, his teammates said, Pierce brings leadership and, perhaps more important, a strutting sense of possibility. With young and talented players in place and high goals within reach, that could be just what the Wizards need.",

    "source": "Attack on U.S. Mission in Benghazi Becomes Subject of Strongest Words <eos> HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — Mitt Romney tried to use the White House’s shifting accounts of the attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya, to paint a broad indictment of President Obama as commander in chief. But Mr. Obama fired back, accusing Mr. Romney of politicizing a tragedy and condemning as “offensive” his suggestion that the administration had misled the American people about nature of the attack. It says something about the murky nature of the Libyan attack, and its messy aftermath, that Mr. Romney appeared not to know that Mr. Obama had labeled it an “act of terror” the day after it occurred. Mr. Romney, disputing Mr. Obama’s account, said, “It took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.” The moderator, Candy Crowley, pointed out to Mr. Romney that the president had called it an act of terror, although she said other officials had spoken about it being a spontaneous demonstration. Likewise, Mr. Obama seemed caught off balance when he was asked why the administration had not acceded to requests from diplomats to bolster security at the embassy in Tripoli, Libya. He did not offer an answer, beyond saying that after he was informed of the assault in Benghazi that he instructed all diplomatic facilities in the region to tighten their security. These tense moments punctuated a fierce back-and-forth exchange between the candidates over the responsibilities of the commander in chief, and Mr. Obama’s record of dealing with the turmoil of the Arab Spring. Mr. Romney said the Libyan attack was part of a broader Middle East policy that was “unraveling right before our eyes.” The president accepted responsibility for the security lapses that led to the attack, saying the four Americans who were killed “are my folks.” He pledged a thorough investigation and said he would have those responsible for it hunted down. But he swiftly turned the tables on Mr. Romney, saying that his campaign had issued a news release criticizing the administration’s handling of the attack before the United States knew the fate of its personnel. “The suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our U.N. ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics and mislead, when we lost four of our own, Governor, is offensive,” Mr. Obama said, glaring at his opponent. “That’s not what we do, that’s not what I do as president, that’s not what I do as commander in chief.” China also figured prominently in a debate for the first time, with Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama trading charges over who would be tougher in cracking down on China’s trade practices. Mr. Romney said the president had missed regular chances to label China a currency manipulator for artificially lowering the value of its currency, making its exports cheaper. Mr. Obama replied that China’s currency had risen during his administration because of constant prodding by the United States. And he jabbed twice that Mr. Romney held investments in Chinese companies and that, as a private-equity investor, had accelerated the trend of jobs being outsourced to China. But it was the disagreement over Benghazi that generated the most fireworks, erupting toward the end of an already fierce debate. The attack and its aftermath has emerged as Mr. Obama’s biggest source of foreign-policy vulnerability. Republicans have seized on it to undermine one of his administration’s major accomplishments: its claim that it has dealt a grievous blow to Al Qaeda with attacks on Osama bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders. After the debate, those on both sides spun the Libya exchange. \"Time and again Mitt Romney was proven wrong, wrong on the facts,\" said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. \"He was even held accountable by Candy Crowley for not telling the truth about the president acknowledging an act of terror. I think tonight Mitt Romney’s campaign fell away.\" But a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, Ed Gillespie, said that the administration initially said that the attack that killed the ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans was \"the result of a YouTube video and a spontaneous demonstration.\" \"It’s just not the case that he condemned these attacks for what they are; it took him a long time,\" Mr. Gillespie added, describing the administration’s early accounts of the attack. \"He did not say that the ambassador was assassinated by terrorists affiliated with Al Qaeda.\" Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s admission, on the eve of the debate, that she bore responsibility for failing to adequately secure the mission did not defuse the issue. “Whether there was some misleading or instead whether we just didn’t know what happened, I think you have to ask yourself, why didn’t we know?,” Mr. Romney said. “This calls into question the president’s whole policy in the Middle East.” Before the debate, Mr. Kerry dismissed suggestions that the president was shifting blame to Mrs. Clinton. Her admission of responsibility for failing to defend the Benghazi mission was appropriate for the secretary of state, he said, and had no bearing on Mr. Obama, whom he said also bore responsibility as the commander in chief. The fusillade of charges, against the murky, frequently shifting narrative of the attack, has generated more confusion than clarity. On Tuesday, the exchange between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney did little to dispel the haze.",

    "source": "When Donald Trump Partied With Richard Nixon <eos> HOUSTON — They still talk about the Saturday night here 27 years ago when Donald J. Trump partied with former President Richard M. Nixon . Dressed in tuxedos, they sang “Happy Birthday” to Texas royalty — former Gov. John B. Connally and his wife, Nellie , whose birthdays were a few days apart — as Nixon played the tune on a white baby grand piano. They dined at Tony’s, the “21” Club of Houston, and Nixon was so fond of the cannelloni pasta that he asked the owner, Tony Vallone, to write the recipe for him on a yellow legal pad. And when it was all over, Mr. Trump flew Nixon back to New York on his 727 private jet. It happened one weekend in March 1989. It was one of Nixon’s first public appearances since the Watergate scandal had forced him to resign in 1974. And it was one of Mr. Trump’s first presidential experiences, as he socialized with and had the ear of a former president for two days in Houston at a gala event, an impromptu after-party at Tony’s, a Sunday brunch the next day at a River Oaks mansion and later aboard his plane. “I think you can see a core of Trump in this,” said Barry Silverman, a Houston advertising and marketing consultant who helped coordinate the gala and was a longtime friend of the Connallys. “He obviously had a road map a lot bigger than any of us ever thought about.” Mr. Silverman and Mr. Vallone said they did not know what, specifically, Mr. Trump and Nixon had talked about at the gala or at Tony’s. But the time they spent together that weekend most likely fed Mr. Trump’s fascination with and admiration of Nixon. During the campaign, Mr. Trump borrowed phrases from him, used his speech at the 1968 Republican convention as a template for his own convention address, and spoke glowingly of Nixon in interviews. The Connallys helped bring the fallen president and the future president-elect together. They had met Mr. Trump a few months earlier at a wedding in New York in December 1988, and Mr. Connally had been a close friend of Nixon’s, serving as his Treasury secretary. Nixon was already familiar with Mr. Trump. The former president had written an unsolicited letter to Mr. Trump in 1987, informing him that Nixon’s wife, Pat, had predicted “that whenever you decide to run for office you will be a winner!” Mr. Connally invited Mr. Trump and his wife, Ivana, to Houston as special guests at “A Night for Nellie,” an event to honor Mrs. Connally at the Westin Galleria hotel on March 11, 1989. Image Richard M. Nixon after resigning the presidency in 1974. Credit Bettmann/Getty Images Houston was just coming out of the 1980s oil bust. Tens of thousands of workers had lost their jobs and homes. Banks had failed. Mr. Connally filed for bankruptcy in 1987, and he and his wife were forced to auction their belongings to help repay creditors in 1988. Then Mrs. Connally learned she had breast cancer. “A Night for Nellie” raised more than $300,000 for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation , but it also sought to lift Mrs. Connally’s spirits — and Houston’s. Barbara Walters was there, along with the airline executive Frank Lorenzo and the elite of Houston society, including Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., an oilman, and his wife, Lynn, who hosted Nixon, Mr. Trump and others at their mansion the next day. In the hotel ballroom, Mr. Trump introduced Nixon and sat at the head table with him. Mr. Connally had assembled the seating chart for the table himself. His wife was seated with Mr. Trump on one side of her and Nixon on the other. Mr. Trump, the event’s honorary chairman, seemed to be enjoying himself. He was 42 years old, and his book “ Trump: The Art of the Deal ,” which had been published in November 1987, had enjoyed a position on The New York Times’s best-seller list for nearly a year. “Donald Trump would have made a sensational Texan,” Ms. Walters told the audience, according to The Austin American-Statesman . Mr. Connally decided late in the evening to keep the party going for some of the V.I.P.s at Tony’s. Mr. Vallone had about a half-hour to clear a third of the restaurant and put on an elaborate buffet. He has wined and dined a host of celebrities and presidents at his restaurant, including Frank Sinatra, Princess Margaret, Andy Warhol and former President Bill Clinton. But he said that night in 1989 was the most memorable. “There was tremendous enthusiasm and electricity in the air,” Mr. Vallone said. “Trump had a commanding presence. People say he’s pompous, but he was not pompous. He was very approachable. He’ll talk to the waiters. After that, I went out and bought six or eight of his books and gave them away as gifts, I was so impressed with Trump.” At Tony’s, Mr. Trump suggested he was taking a business interest in Houston. “Every time I’m in a particular city that I like, and Houston happens to be a city that I like very much, I do look,” he told KTRK-TV , an ABC affiliate, as he stood in the restaurant. Nixon stayed there until 1 a.m. The party continued well after. “Dom Pérignon was flowing like ginger ale,” Mr. Silverman said, “and it went on until 3 in the morning.” The next day, the Trumps, the Connallys and Nixon were among 36 guests at a brunch at the Wyatts’ mansion. They ate beef Wellington and sipped Champagne with dessert. Ms. Wyatt, one of Houston’s most prominent socialites and philanthropists, asked Nixon to speak about world affairs, and Nixon stood, gave a brief speech and then took questions. Asked if Mr. Trump had asked a question, Ms. Wyatt replied: “I’m sure he did. Everybody did. I was so proud of my guests because they asked such intelligent questions. I don’t have any stupid friends.”",

    "source": "Democrats Turn to Hillary Clinton After Flirting With Bernie Sanders <eos> FAIRFAX, Va. — On the eve of Super Tuesday, as Hillary Clinton urged her supporters to turn out to vote, people on the sidelines of her campaign rally here seemed less revved up than resigned. The time had come, several said, to end their romance with Bernie Sanders and settle down with Mrs. Clinton. “Bernie Sanders’s odds of getting the nomination are maybe not that great,” said Mitchell Westall, 19, of Suffolk, Va., who added that he had been intrigued by the Vermont senator’s vision. “So I’m looking at the other Democrat.” Mrs. Clinton, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state, is not used to being “the other Democrat.” But as voters cast ballots Tuesday in 11 states that could give her a prohibitive lead in the race for the party’s presidential nomination, she seemed to be enjoying something of a homecoming: After eyeing, enjoying and encouraging Mr. Sanders’s insurgency for months, Democrats seemed ready to restore to Mrs. Clinton and her candidacy the air of inevitability with which she began her campaign in April. Across the country, from the crucial swing state of Virginia to deeper-blue Minnesota, from the Sanders strongholds in New England to the Clinton redoubts of the South, many Democratic voters said that despite being aware, and sometimes wary, of Mrs. Clinton’s trust issues, they were more than ready to support her. Often, they said they were swayed as much by the arguments of Mrs. Clinton’s most persuasive surrogates — delegate math, and “Fear of a Trump Presidency” — as by the candidate herself. Seeing Donald J. Trump as an existential threat to American values, many Democrats said in interviews that they were ready to eschew the dreamy Sanders revolution for the heavy artillery of Mrs. Clinton and her battle-tested campaign machine. “If this country gets a Republican, we are in big trouble, especially with Trump,” Flor Giraldo, 59, an unemployed emergency room technician, said Tuesday outside of a polling place in Chelsea, Mass. “If he gets chosen, this will be an impossible country, and I think Hillary is going to save us.” In the Boston neighborhood of West Roxbury, where Mayor Martin J. Walsh and former President Bill Clinton campaigned for Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday morning, her supporters acknowledged grappling with whether they could trust Mrs. Clinton and worrying that something explosive, and destructive to her candidacy, could still come to light. “I hope there’s nothing in those speeches that she made,” said Adrienne Vaughan, an immigration lawyer, referring to Mrs. Clinton’s speeches to Goldman Sachs and other financial firms, for which she was paid handsomely but has not released transcripts. Similar concerns echoed in Decatur, Ga., where Dana Calleja, 47, said she had voted for Mrs. Clinton while admitting that she had reservations. “I wish there weren’t all of the questions around the emails and Benghazi,” Ms. Calleja said, “but it all came down to qualifications.” In dozens of interviews, voters said their desire for an experienced candidate who would be favored to win in November had played a greater role in their decisions than enthusiasm for Mrs. Clinton. “I don’t vote with my emotions,” said Bridget Coughlan Hermer, 54, a teacher and Clinton supporter from Madison Lake, Minn. “I vote with my head.” Image Denise Blake of Atlanta said Donald J. Trump’s “terrifying” ascent had persuaded her to vote for Hillary Clinton on Tuesday. Credit Kevin D. Liles for The New York Times Through such a pragmatic frame, Ms. Hermer saw a silver lining to Mrs. Clinton’s ties to Wall Street, which Mr. Sanders has assailed as emblematic of a rigged campaign finance system: “She knows how to earn money and keep her campaign running,” Ms. Hermer said. One thing nearly all of Mrs. Clinton’s supporters agree on is that her résumé is without compare in the primary contest. In Austin, Tex., Donald Goertz, 76, a former classics teacher, said he had voted for Mrs. Clinton because “I can’t imagine anybody more knowledgeable than Hillary.” But he said he had to fight the tug of Mr. Sanders’s message: “I like his populism.” And when his wife, Donna Bryant Goertz, 76, a founder of Austin’s oldest Montessori school, professed her affection for Mrs. Clinton, it was in the form of tough love: “I love Hillary,” she said. “I think what she needs is a strong dose of Bernie. I voted for Bernie — to push her more in the direction that we would both like her to go.” The adoration for Mrs. Clinton was less conditional in Atlanta’s West End, where African-American voters trickling into a polling place at West Hunter Street Baptist Church had warm things to say about her, but warmer things to say about her husband. “I’m comfortable because her husband was president,” said Walter Clark, 53, who drives trains for the local commuter-rail system. “She knows the ins and outs.” Who Will Win Super Tuesday? Live Estimates of Tonight’s Final Republican Delegate Count Live estimates of the number of delegates each Republican candidate will pick up on Super Tuesday. Denise Blake, 49, the executive director of a nonprofit, said that despite being tempted by Mr. Sanders’s demand for a radical fix to income inequality, Mr. Trump’s “terrifying” ascent had pushed her into Mrs. Clinton’s column. Not all of Mrs. Clinton’s supporters, of course, needed an extra nudge. Many women interviewed took visible pride in the prospect of voting for a woman for president for the first time. And in an election that has been dominated in its early stages by energy for outsider candidates, voters also expressed appreciation for Mrs. Clinton’s long career, and her ability to work within a political framework that they did not consider all that broken. “Clinton. Women power!” blurted out Chetna Maheshwari, 44, a teacher who emigrated from India, as she walked Monday evening with her daughter at the Rust Library in suburban Leesburg, Va. Ms. Maheshwari said she voted for Mrs. Clinton in Virginia’s presidential primary in 2008, and seemed uninterested in Mr. Sanders’s call for revolution. “We have a system in place, and it’s working,” she said. “Why keep changing it again and again?” She said she hoped Mrs. Clinton would build on President Obama’s record and protect abortion rights. Not unlike Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Maheshwari said she was already looking past Mr. Sanders and toward the Democrats’ ability to preserve the country’s inclusive character. But the election may hinge less on genuine passion for Mrs. Clinton than on alarm about the advancing opponent Democrats see in the fall. “Stopping Donald Trump is something that’s definitely on my mind, as he is getting a lot of support,” Mr. Westall said at the Fairfax rally. “If it comes down to him and Hillary, there is almost no choice but to vote for Hillary there.”",

    "source": "Syndergaard’s Bat, and Arm, Lift the Mets <eos> PHOENIX — At 6 feet 6 inches and 240 pounds, Noah Syndergaard often looks better suited for a football field than a baseball diamond. His large frame and quick arm generate the power behind his high-octane fastballs, which have been clocked as high as 102 miles per hour. His strong body also helps him at the plate. In the Mets’ 7-5 win over the lowly Arizona Diamondbacks on Tuesday, which moved them back above .500, Syndergaard produced the biggest moment of the game with his quick, strong swing and not his powerful right arm. Facing Braden Shipley, the Diamondbacks’ starter, in the fifth inning, Syndergaard crushed a two-run home run that landed nearly halfway up Section 103 in right field at Chase Field. The 415-foot shot broke a 1-1 tie and sparked the Mets’ offensive outburst. The blast was the fourth of Syndergaard’s career, and third of this season, trying a Mets single-season record for home runs by a pitcher. Tom Seaver hit three home runs in 1972, and Walt Terrell matched the feat in 1983. Syndergaard has a month and a half’s worth of starts left this season to top the record. “Noah is dangerous,” Manager Terry Collins said. “He’s got huge power.” With the victory, the Mets improved their record to 60-59. They also beat Arizona (49-70) for the first time this season in five tries. On the mound Tuesday, Syndergaard labored at times. High pitch counts have plagued him often in the second half of the season. But he was also hurt by fielding errors by third baseman T. J. Rivera, which led to Syndergaard’s exit with two outs in the sixth inning. Syndergaard (10-7) allowed four runs, only two earned, on seven hits in five and two-thirds innings. He has not pitched more than six innings since July 3. Still, Syndergaard had thrown 79 pitches through five innings on Tuesday before the fateful sixth. Rivera’s throw wide of first base put Jake Lamb on base to start the inning. Mitch Haniger’s one-out triple drove in Lamb and Welington Castillo, who had singled. Syndergaard got a pop-up for the inning’s second out, but Rivera bobbled the next ground ball for his second error of the inning. Collins took Syndergaard out when Jean Segura reached on an infield single. Rivera did not make a strong throw to first base on Segura’s grounder, nor James Loney did stretch enough for it. In the dugout, Syndergaard threw down his glove. Even though Syndergaard and the Mets’ defense were not at their sharpest, the team’s offense created enough cushion to withstand mistakes. Before the Mets’ lineup broke out, Syndergaard provided a spark. With one out in the fifth inning, a runner on base and the score tied at 1, Syndergaard came to bat against Shipley. Syndergaard whiffed at two changeups but took three pitches out of the strike zone. Facing a full count, Shipley tempted fate by firing a 91-mile-per-hour fastball down the middle of the plate. Syndergaard unloaded a quick, effortless uppercut swing that sent the ball into the right-field seats for a 3-1 Mets lead. The Mets dugout erupted. Rene Rivera clapped his hands while Jay Bruce and Kevin Long, the Mets’ hitting coach, laughed. After Syndergaard’s blast, the Mets piled on. They did this without their hottest hitter, second baseman Neil Walker, who was scratched with lower back stiffness as a precaution by Collins. Bruce, Alejandro De Aza and Jose Reyes each collected two hits. Kelly Johnson drilled a solo home run in the sixth inning. And despite his fielding miscues, T. J. Rivera sprayed four hits and scored two runs in his seventh major league game. With Syndergaard’s help, the Mets’ highest scoring output in two weeks gave them sufficient margin of error when the Diamondbacks pulled to within two runs in the seventh inning. Jeurys Familia pitched an uneventful ninth for his 40th save.",

    "source": "Coalition Leader Warns of Long Fight Against ISIS in Iraq <eos> BAGHDAD — The American official coordinating the international coalition fighting the Islamic State said on Friday that the Iraqi military would not be ready for a campaign to retake Mosul, the largest Iraqi city under insurgent control, for as much as a year. Mosul has become a symbol of the strength of the Islamist insurgency, which has made the city its stronghold, and of the failure of the Iraqi security forces, which wilted in June as militants swept across the Syrian border and overran the city as they pushed toward Baghdad. The broad timeline given by the official, retired Gen. John R. Allen, seemed to reflect the immense challenges facing the Iraqi military command and its international partners, including about 1,600 American troops deployed by President Obama, as they seek to rebuild the Iraqi security forces. “When it’s undertaken, the right kind of planning and preparation will have been done to make sure the outcome will favor the Iraqis,” said General Allen, a retired Marine who served in the Iraq War and was the top American commander in Afghanistan. “The operation will kick off within a year,” he told reporters, though he warned that the struggle would be protracted. Mosul is the second-largest city in Iraq. “It’s not a single battle,” he said. “It’s a campaign.” General Allen’s comments came during a brief trip to Iraq to meet with what he called “a broad range of actors across the Iraqi political and military spheres.” It was his first visit to Baghdad since his appointment by the Obama administration last month to lead the international coalition. In the northern and western parts of the country that it controls, the Islamic State has carried out mass executions, abducted women and girls as sex slaves and imposed a harsh form of Shariah, or Islamic law. Relief officials say more than a million people have been displaced from their homes. On Friday, the insurgents distributed leaflets demanding that all medical personnel and teachers who left areas under their control return to their hometowns within 10 days. Violators would be penalized by the confiscation of their homes and possessions, the Islamic State warned. Zeid Ra’ad Zeid al-Hussein , the new United Nations high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement this week that the insurgency’s abuses “may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity.” Officials fear that the longer the group is allowed to remain in control of conquered areas, the more entrenched it will become and the harder it will be to dislodge. Yet so far, the Iraqi military, despite the support of an American-led campaign of airstrikes, has not been able to make significant, sustained gains against the insurgency. Iraqi Army Retakes Government Complex in Central Ramadi Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State. In response to a question about the efficacy of the aerial bombardments, General Allen said they had “slowed the momentum” of the Islamic State and provided valuable support for Iraqi forces holding strategic positions, like the Haditha Dam in Anbar Province, and for Iraqi forces retaking ground, like the battle in August at the Mosul Dam. Two more nations on Friday were poised to join the aerial campaign. In Australia, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that his country’s forces would take part in airstrikes and that special operations units would advise the Iraqi military. In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked Parliament on Friday to approve airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Iraq. A vote was expected on Monday, and approval seemed likely. But General Allen emphasized that the strategy to beat back and destroy the insurgency would be a long and complex military and political effort. A centerpiece will be strengthening the Iraqi security forces, which have suffered from poor leadership, low morale, rampant corruption and chronic problems of logistics, intelligence and resupply, officials say. “We must build Iraqi capacity to take on the fight,” General Allen said, reiterating Mr. Obama’s vow not to deploy American combat troops to Iraq. A vital piece of the military strategy includes a plan to bolster national guard units under the authority of the provincial governors. The plan — proposed by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi last month — echoes a strategy employed during the Iraq War, in which moderate Sunni tribes were paid and armed to fight alongside Iraqi and American troops. General Allen was the deputy Marine commander in Anbar Province at the time and helped to guide the formation and implementation of that strategy, called the Awakening. But officials say the details of the national guard project are still being worked out, including how to engage the Sunni tribes and whether to eventually integrate Shiite militias. In the meantime, however, some Sunni tribal groups, either on their own or in collaboration with Iraqi security forces, have taken up arms against Islamic State fighters. In recent weeks, officials said, Sunni tribal fighters have played a crucial role in several battles against Islamic State. This week, for instance, an unusual de facto alliance evolved in the district of Dhuluiya, about 50 miles north of Baghdad, where Sunni fighters from the Jubouri tribe found themselves fighting alongside Shiite militias — widely feared and mistrusted by Sunnis — and Iraqi security forces. “What made us fight together is that we face the same rival,” Hussein Abdulla al-Jubouri, a tribal sheikh from Dhuluiya, said in an interview on Friday. While there was no formal agreement to fight together, he said, the various forces aligned out of common purpose. The alliance, he said, managed to repel the insurgents. “We fought as one hand,” he said.",

    "source": "Few Former Collegians Excel on WTA Tour <eos> CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Although she stands a foot and a half shorter, at 5 feet 3 inches, it seemed fair to wonder if Robin Anderson might one day become the John Isner of the women’s game. The 6-9 Isner, who reached a career-high ranking of No. 9 in 2012, remains the highest-ranked American man, at No. 16. Isner has also served as the standard-bearer of collegiate tennis on the professional circuit, having played for four years at Georgia before turning pro in 2007. But women’s college tennis has not had an equivalent representative in recent years; no one in the current WTA top 100 played college tennis. Anderson, a sophomore who plays for U.C.L.A., blasted through her opposition at the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Division I national women’s team indoor championship here this past weekend. Anderson won her first 22 games at the event, hitting powerful serves and ground strokes that might not be expected from a player her size. Her form seemed to impress Jeff Wallace, who coaches the women’s team at Georgia. “She would be one that I’d say would be right there at the front of the line,” he said when asked if any of the current women’s players at the college level could have a major effect as a pro. But while Isner and other men’s players like 29th-ranked Kevin Anderson, an Illinois alumnus, have been able to make a successful transition from the top of the college game to the top levels of the ATP Tour, women have not been able to successfully navigate similar courses in the last several years. Still, women have shown an ability to achieve bigger pro results at younger ages than their male counterparts, a disparity that can be seen in the rankings of the tours. There are 10 teenagers inside the top 100 of the WTA rankings. The highest ranked is 19-year-old Sloane Stephens, No. 17; the youngest is 92nd-ranked Donna Vekic, 16, of Croatia. Conversely, the highest-ranked teenager in Monday’s ATP rankings is the Czech 19-year-old Jiri Vesely, who is No. 250. While there is more success by younger players on the women’s side, more and more players have been able to continue dominating at advanced ages on both tours, and the average age of top players has increased. Roger Federer and Serena Williams, the defending Wimbledon champions and the second-ranked players on their tours, are each 31. The last major college success story on the women’s side is the American Lisa Raymond, who at 39 focuses solely on doubles. Raymond won two national championships in singles for Florida in 1992 and 1993 and has since won 11 Grand Slam doubles titles (six in women’s, five in mixed). Raymond reached her first Grand Slam doubles final in 1994, one year after leaving college. She also reached a career-high ranking of No. 15 in singles in 1997 and remains the most recent former women’s college player to break the top 20 in singles. There are five women who played college tennis inside the top 200. Three of the four are rising quickly and have rankings that are career highs: the 2011 Southern California graduate Maria Sanchez is No. 114, the former Stanford player Mallory Burdette is No. 126, and the Stanford junior Nicole Gibbs is No. 199. No. 132 Julia Cohen, who has a career-high ranking of 97th, played at three different colleges. Irina Falconi, who spent two years at Georgia Tech, is ranked No. 140, down from a career-high No. 73 in 2011. “I was doing really well in the juniors,” Anderson said of her decision to go to college. “But I felt that I still needed to develop, and I felt that there were still a lot of things in my game that I needed to improve on before I moved on to go pro. I decided college was the best thing for me.” Anderson’s coach at U.C.L.A., Stella Sampras Webster, agreed that Anderson’s path would have been much more difficult if she had turned pro right away. “She would have gone out there, and it would have been tough,” said Sampras Webster, the sister of Pete Sampras. “Because right now, she’s getting so many matches. She’s gotten to play and win a lot of matches, and on the tour, you can lose your mojo very quickly. And if you don’t have that support, it can be a nightmare.” Anderson, aware of the tour’s changing demographics, said: “The average age of the top pros that are making it, they’re like 25, 26. I still have time. I have the time in college now to get better and to develop. So when I feel ready, I’ll go out there and I’ll play.” Sanchez, the highest-ranked former college player on the WTA Tour, said she thought perceptions were changing about a young woman’s career path in tennis. “When I was in high school, it definitely seemed that way, that it was either college or professional,” she said. “And if you went to college, by the time you graduated, it was going to be too late to go pro. But I think players now have changed that.” Gibbs, the reigning N.C.A.A. champion, said she thought the level of play in college tennis, compared with that of the professional ranks, was underrated. “The worlds are very different, but at the end of the day, the tennis isn’t that different,” she said during the Australian Open, where she played in the qualifying draw. Wallace, the coach at Georgia, said of players like Sanchez and Gibbs: “You just need one or two to get out there and start doing really well. And I think that opens the doors for a lot of people to believe that they can, that they could be the next one. Because there’s certainly a lot of great players out here playing in college tennis.”",

    "source": "Chemical Weapons Showdown With Syria Led to Rare Accord <eos> WASHINGTON — In the last days of November, Israel’s top military commanders called the Pentagon to discuss troubling intelligence that was showing up on satellite imagery: Syrian troops appeared to be mixing chemicals at two storage sites, probably the deadly nerve gas sarin, and filling dozens of 500-pounds bombs that could be loaded on airplanes. Within hours President Obama was notified, and the alarm grew over the weekend, as the munitions were loaded onto vehicles near Syrian air bases. In briefings, administration officials were told that if Syria’s increasingly desperate president, Bashar al-Assad, ordered the weapons to be used, they could be airborne in less than two hours — too fast for the United States to act, in all likelihood. What followed next, officials said, was a remarkable show of international cooperation over a civil war in which the United States, Arab states, Russia and China have almost never agreed on a common course of action. The combination of a public warning by Mr. Obama and more sharply worded private messages sent to the Syrian leader and his military commanders through Russia and others, including Iraq, Turkey and possibly Jordan, stopped the chemical mixing and the bomb preparation. A week later Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said the worst fears were over — for the time being. But concern remains that Mr. Assad could now use the weapons produced that week at any moment. American and European officials say that while a crisis was averted in that week from late November to early December, they are by no means resting easy. “I think the Russians understood this is the one thing that could get us to intervene in the war,” one senior defense official said last week. “What Assad understood, and whether that understanding changes if he gets cornered in the next few months, that’s anyone’s guess.” While chemical weapons are technically considered a “weapon of mass destruction” — along with biological and nuclear weapons — in fact they are hard to use and hard to deliver. Whether an attack is effective can depend on the winds and the terrain. Sometimes attacks are hard to detect, even after the fact. Syrian forces could employ them in a village or a neighborhood, some officials say, and it would take time for the outside world to know. But the scare a month ago has renewed debate about whether the West should help the Syrian opposition destroy Mr. Assad’s air force, which he would need to deliver those 500-pound bombs. The chemical munitions are still in storage areas that are near or on Syrian air bases, ready for deployment on short notice, officials said. The Obama administration and other governments have said little in public about the chemical weapons movements, in part because of concern about compromising sources of intelligence about the activities of Mr. Assad’s forces. This account is based on interviews with more than half a dozen military, intelligence and diplomatic officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the intelligence matters involved. The head of Germany’s foreign intelligence service, the BND, warned in a confidential assessment last month that the weapons could now be deployed four to six hours after orders were issued, and that Mr. Assad had a special adviser at his side who oversaw control of the weapons, the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported. Some American and other allied officials, however, said in interviews that the sarin-laden bombs could be loaded on planes and airborne in less than two hours. Video The Times’s David E. Sanger discusses the bid to keep the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, from using chemical weapons. “Let’s just say right now, it would be a relatively easy thing to load this quickly onto aircraft,” said one Western diplomat. How the United States and Israel, along with Arab states, would respond remains a mystery. American and allied officials have talked vaguely of having developed “contingency plans” in case they decided to intervene in an effort to neutralize the chemical weapons, a task that the Pentagon estimates would require upward of 75,000 troops. But there have been no evident signs of preparations for any such effort. The United States military has quietly sent a task force of more than 150 planners and other specialists to Jordan to help the armed forces there, among other things, prepare for the possibility that Syria will lose control of its chemical weapons. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was reported to have traveled to Jordan in recent weeks, and the Israeli news media have said the topic of discussion was how to deal with Syrian weapons if it appeared that they could be transferred to Lebanon, where Hezbollah could lob them over the border to Israel. But the plans, to the extent they exist, remain secret. American, Israeli and other allied officials remained fixed on this potential crisis, especially as the opposition appears to have gained more momentum, seizing several Syrian military bases and the weapons stored there, and have been closing in on Damascus, the Syrian capital. In response, Syria has reached deeper into its conventional arsenal, including firing Scud ballistic missiles at rebel positions near Aleppo. Over the past week a new concern emerged: Syrian forces began shooting new, accurate short-range missiles, believed to have been manufactured in Iran. None had chemical warheads. But their use showed that the Syrian military was now deploying a more accurate weapon than the notoriously inaccurate Scud missiles they have used in previous attacks. As the fighting has escalated, American and other allied officials have said that government troops have moved some of the chemical stockpiles to safer locations, a consolidation that, if it continues, could actually help Western forces should they have to enter Syria to seize control of the munitions or destroy them. Syria’s chemical weapons are under the control of a secretive Syrian air force organization called Unit 450, a highly vetted outfit that is deemed one of the most loyal to the Assad government given the importance of the weapons in its custody. American officials said that some of the back-channel messages in recent weeks were directed at the commanders of this unit, warning them — as Mr. Obama warned Mr. Assad on Dec. 3 — that they would be held personally responsible if the government used its chemical weapons. Asked about these communications and whether they have been successful, an American intelligence official said only, “The topic is extremely sensitive, and public discussion, even on background, will be problematic.” Allied officials say whatever safeguards the Syrian government have taken, there remains great concern that the weapons could fall into the hands of Islamist extremists fighting the government or the militant group Hezbollah, which has established small training camps near some of the storage sites. “Militants who got their hands on such munitions would find it difficult to deploy them effectively without the associated aircraft, artillery or rocket launcher systems,” said Jeremy Binnie, a terrorism and insurgency specialist at IHS Jane’s Defense Weekly . “That said, Hezbollah would probably be able to deploy them effectively against Israel with a bit of help.”",

    "source": "Liverpool Closes In on Championship That It Last Won 24 Years Ago <eos> LIVERPOOL, England — They sang “You’ll Never Walk Alone” and “We Shall Not Be Moved” and, over and over, “Liiiiiverpool.” The fans at Anfield seemed never to go quiet once the game began on Sunday, and soon, perhaps, they will sing about being champions. That was the measure of Liverpool’s 3-2 victory over visiting Manchester City, a spirited and intense game that had all the ingredients of a classic: goals, drama and atmosphere in bunches. The Reds scored two goals early, but City came back with two goals, threatening to ruin the day for the home team. Then Philippe Coutinho pounced on a loose ball and buried a shot in the 78th minute, giving rise to this reality: If Liverpool wins its four remaining games, it will claim the title in England’s top league for the first time since 1990. It is a heady position for Manager Brendan Rodgers of Liverpool, which has won 10 Premier League games in a row and has dropped just 4 points in 15 games in 2014. The Reds sit 2 points ahead of Chelsea — which beat Swansea, 1-0, on Sunday to keep pace — and 7 points ahead of Manchester City, which has played two fewer games. When Sunday’s game was over, Steven Gerrard, Liverpool’s captain, gathered his teammates. The players threw their arms around one another; Gerrard blinked away tears as he addressed them. “That was the biggest statement we’ve made so far,” Gerrard said later. “That was the longest 90 minutes I’ve probably ever played in. It felt like the clock was going backwards during parts of that game.” The expectation for the match was immense. Fans packed trains out of London’s Euston station early Sunday, spilling out of the cars and into the vestibules during the three-hour journey to Anfield. When they arrived in Merseyside, they found pubs packed to the brim and scalpers roaming the streets; tickets normally priced at £52 (roughly $87) were being peddled online for as much as $4,200. Most observers labeled it the biggest league match at Anfield in nearly a quarter of a century. Emotions were running high even before kickoff. A memorial service on Tuesday will commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough stadium disaster, in which 96 fans died, and Sunday’s prematch ceremonies included a minute’s silence, the presentation of a wreath of flowers from Manchester City and a stunning mosaic reading, “96 — 25 years,” which was displayed in the famed Kop end. The game began at 1:37 p.m., seven minutes late, because the 1989 F.A. Cup semifinal in which the catastrophe occurred was stopped after six minutes. Image Coutinho pounced on a loose ball and buried the shot in the 78th minute. Credit Peter Powell/European Pressphoto Agency A new round of proceedings about the disaster is continuing , forcing Liverpool residents to compartmentalize their feelings. There remains a desire for justice: Initial reports said the deaths, on an overcrowded terrace, were accidental, but more recent revelations have indicated that the authorities neglected to take steps to mitigate the crushing of the fans and then concealed evidence that indicated their culpability. The battle has been fought here for more than two decades, and with that charged backdrop, Liverpool’s performance on the field has stirred feelings. The Reds were not picked to be title contenders this season, with most predictions calling for them to be battling for one of the Champions League places, awarded to the top four finishers. Indeed, the only thing more surprising this season than Manchester United’s collapse into irrelevancy may be Liverpool’s rapid ascent. The Reds have done it through will and pluckiness and, often, the goals of Luis Suárez. Suárez did not score Sunday, but he did play a significant part as Liverpool was flying from the opening whistle, moving with such speed in the opening stages that it seemed as if Manchester City’s players were chasing shadows. “We just have to play with no fear,” said Rodgers, the manager. That is rarely a problem for Suárez, who will never be known as the calm, quiet type. He was booked inside five minutes after a needlessly late tackle on Martín Demichelis. True to form, Suárez came up barking at the referee, but then, true to form, Suárez dazzled moments later, slipping a perfect through ball to Raheem Sterling. Sterling, a young wing, showed no signs of nerves: He shed Vincent Kompany, then danced alongside Joe Hart, the onrushing goalkeeper, before coolly depositing the ball into the net. The Kop end of the stadium erupted anew. The fans roared even louder when Martin Skrtel headed home a perfect corner kick by Gerrard less than 20 minutes later. City, it seemed, was on the precipice of being knocked out. City, however, found some fight and controlled play for much of the rest of the game. David Silva scored off a pretty pass from James Milner early in the second half, and City benefited when Liverpool defender Glen Johnson turned the ball into his own net to level the score with a half-hour remaining. With its two games in hand, City would have been plenty pleased with a draw. Still Liverpool pushed on. Suárez, who avoided a second yellow card for diving, was not getting many useful passes from his teammates, but after Kompany could not clear the ball, Coutinho stepped into a blast that rescued the day for the Reds, if not the season. “We made a mistake, and then we lost the game,” City Manager Manuel Pellegrini said. Rodgers, referring to Liverpool’s streak, said, “Hopefully, 10 wins will become 11 next week.” It is all on the Reds now, with four games left: at Norwich, home against Chelsea, at Crystal Palace and then, on the final day of the season, a last match at Anfield against Newcastle. The singing that day could be sublime.",

    "source": "Articles on Editor Chauncey Bailey’s Killing Made a Difference <eos> When Chauncey Bailey, the editor of The Oakland Post, in California, was gunned down in broad daylight on a city street 18 months ago, it was not the end of his journalism. In some ways, it was a new beginning. After his death, a group of reporters — some retired, some out of work — with support from foundations and the University of California, Berkeley, banded together to continue his investigation into a local business called Your Black Muslim Bakery and to look at any role the bakery may have played in Mr. Bailey’s murder and at the role of the police in its investigation. The group, named The Chauncey Bailey Project, has had a deep impact on the city’s public life, broadcasting a jailhouse videotape that suggested a wider conspiracy in the murder and which the police seemingly ignored, and helping force the resignation of the Oakland police chief, Wayne Tucker. The group has said that much of its work is done, but it says it will not shutter the operation completely until the investigation of Yusuf Bey IV, a son of the founder of the bakery, has been completed. Mr. Tucker suggested that an indictment was likely during a news conference after his resignation and that it would show a larger conspiracy in the murder of Mr. Bailey. Mr. Bey has denied culpability in the murder in an interview with one of the reporters on the project. Rebecca Kaplan, a City Council member, publicly credited the group of reporters with airing the police’s dirty laundry. “Even if everything was an honest mistake, the Chauncey Bailey case is shining a light on what we need to be looking at,” Ms. Kaplan said. Robert Rosenthal, the executive director of the Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit organization based in Berkeley that became the headquarters for the project, said the participants came together in part as a result of the decimation of local media, which precluded large-scale investigative work. “I think the issues of downsizing and economic turmoil are the catalyst for this,” said Mr. Rosenthal, a former editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer. Mr. Bailey had a place in Oakland newspaper lore not necessarily as a gifted reporter but for his ubiquity in the community and ear for neighborhood chatter. He was once fired from The Oakland Tribune for an ethical breach, but had another act as editor of The Oakland Post. There, he began to look into Your Black Muslim Bakery, now defunct but once a prominent institution in the city’s black community. It sprouted in the late 1960s against the backdrop of the Black Power movement and was once praised for giving jobs to young African-Americans. The bakery went bankrupt in 2006, leaving a wake of violence, an unpaid loan to the city of Oakland, problems with the Internal Revenue Service, and unrest. Its founder, Yusuf Bey, died in 2003. His son Yusuf Bey IV was briefly the leader of the organization, but now sits in jail, charged with kidnapping, torture and carjacking. The charges are not related to the Bailey investigation. On Aug. 2, 2007, Mr. Bailey was shot three times with a sawed-off shotgun as he walked to work after eating breakfast at McDonald’s. Days later, a former dishwasher at the bakery, Devaughndre Broussard, was charged with the murder. The project formed in the fall of 2007. It modeled itself on The Arizona Project, which was created after the 1976 car-bomb murder of Don Bolles, an Arizona Republic reporter who had been writing about organized crime. The reporters began by examining the bakery. “Pretty soon, we found the bakery was a cesspool,” said Bob Butler, an independent journalist who was a longtime reporter for CBS Radio before he was laid off in 2006. In a series of articles published last year in The Tribune, The Contra Costa Times and on KTVU-TV, a Bay Area television station, the journalists reported a longstanding relationship between the detective in charge of the Bailey case and the younger Mr. Bey, a connection first reported by The San Francisco Chronicle. It also found that the detective had not included in his case notes data from a tracking device on Mr. Bey’s car that showed him outside Mr. Bailey’s apartment the night before the murder, the articles said. Mary Fricker, a retired reporter who had worked for 20 years at The Santa Rosa Press-Democrat, pored over databases and old files and documented a pattern of sexual assault and misconduct by the founder of the bakery. She joined the project, even though she lives two hours north of Oakland in wine country, and spent many nights on a colleague’s couch. “Could the local media have done this story? No, especially because it came at a time when local media was imploding,” Ms. Fricker said. The pivotal point for the project occurred on an afternoon last spring. Over a sushi lunch in a downtown Oakland restaurant, a source slipped Thomas Peele, a reporter for The Bay Area News Group, a videotape. The tape, secretly recorded by the police, showed Yusuf Bey IV sitting with associates in a jailhouse room, bragging about being a part of Mr. Bailey’s murder. First reported by The San Francisco Chronicle, the tape raised critical questions — still unanswered — about why the police had not charged Mr. Bey in the murder. The reporting also led to a number of investigations by agencies outside Oakland. The Bailey murder case has been taken from the Oakland police and turned over to the Alameda County district attorney’s office. Jerry Brown, the California attorney general, is investigating the way police handled the case. More recently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation stepped in to investigate allegations raised by the project that the chief of internal affairs at the department had beaten a drug suspect, who later died. The project also reopened a decades-old murder case in Santa Barbara, Calif., where a precursor to the bakery operated in the 1960s. Last month, Chief Tucker, the head of Oakland’s police, announced he would step down, in part as a result of the handling of the Bailey murder investigation. “We made mistakes on that case,” he said at a news conference, and acknowledged that Yusuf Bey IV is “the one we want” to complete the case. Reporters involved in the project gently point out that they have pushed the inquiry further than Mr. Bailey might have. Mr. Bailey, who was posthumously named Journalist of the Year by the Northern California Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists for his “fierce commitment to investigative journalism in the face of personal danger,” was not regarded as an investigative journalist. He had written a draft of an article on the bakery, but it had been killed because its reporting was subpar, according to Paul Cobb, the publisher of The Oakland Post. “There’s been more scrutiny of the Oakland Police Department because of his death than he ever would have accomplished at The Oakland Post,” Mr. Peele said. Martin Reynolds, the editor of The Oakland Tribune and an executive with The Bay Area News Group, the paper’s parent company, has been heartened by the strong reaction to the project. “The response from our readers has shown that the best way to preserve our relevance is through investigative reporting,” said Mr. Reynolds, who has steadily cut his own company’s newsrooms. “It’s what we can still do better than anyone else.”",

    "source": "Rutgers’s Stringer Still Has Fans in Iowa <eos> DES MOINES — It is always primary season in Iowa for Bill Fennelly. Every month for the past 13 years, Fennelly, the Iowa State women’s basketball coach, has hit the campaign trail, crisscrossing the state to expand his constituency one civic breakfast at a time. Wherever he goes, from Algona to Zwingle, Fennelly is following the path blazed by C. Vivian Stringer. She built the University of Iowa women’s program into a national title contender and an attendance leader in the 1980s before leaving to coach the Rutgers women in 1995. On Monday night, their paths will converge for only the second time since Stringer left Iowa and since Fennelly, a native Iowan, returned. Stringer’s second-seeded Rutgers team will face Fennelly’s seventh-seeded Iowa State squad in a second-round N.C.A.A. tournament game at Wells Fargo Arena, a 30-mile trip from the Iowa State campus in Ames. They met for the first time in 1998, in a second-round tournament game in Ames that Rutgers won, 62-61. “When the brackets came out, one of the very first things I heard was excitement that we were in and that Coach Stringer was coming back to Iowa,” Fennelly said Sunday. “She has a great amount of respect, and deservedly so.” In 1983, Stringer left Cheyney State, a program that she had guided to one Final Four, for Iowa City, which was then a Big Ten women’s basketball outpost. Within two years, Iowa led the nation in women’s basketball attendance. In her third season, Iowa qualified for the N.C.A.A. tournament. In 1993, the Hawkeyes advanced to the Final Four. “I think what she did at the University of Iowa and the fan base and the way she changed the program certainly has helped all of us,” Fennelly said. “I think it brought women’s basketball into the forefront in our state, maybe a little bit before some of the other states were doing it.” Stringer’s effect was so great, many Iowans said at the time, only half in jest, that she could run for governor. In 1986, Bump Elliott, who was then the athletic director at Iowa, suggested a state job that carried, perhaps, an even higher profile. The Hawkeyes had lost their men’s basketball coach, George Raveling, to the University of Southern California. Elliott solicited Stringer’s advice on candidates to succeed Raveling. At the end of the conversation, he said: “What about you? Would you be interested?” Elliott, who had played football at Michigan, did not consider it that far-fetched an idea. Two years earlier, Geraldine Ferraro had run for vice president on the Democratic ticket with Walter Mondale. Stringer had one of the sharpest basketball minds of anyone Elliott knew, so why shouldn’t she be a legitimate candidate? Stringer, though intrigued by the idea, quickly dismissed it. “She said she didn’t think the timing was right where a woman should coach a men’s team,” Elliott said Saturday in a telephone interview. “She didn’t say it couldn’t be done. She just said the timing wasn’t right.” That was then. What about now? In 2008, when Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is running for president, is the timing right? “In a way, yeah, I think it is,” Stringer said Sunday, adding, “There are some women, believe it our not, some of my colleagues who I think would do well and would want to coach a men’s team.” Stringer, 60, spoke about how young men today “are probably a lot more receptive about a lot of things.” She added, “If things were a little further along on the women’s side, I would entertain the idea very much.” In the march of progress, there is still a great deal of road for the women to travel, still many rough patches to smooth over, as the radio host Don Imus made clear last year with his sexist and racist comments directed at the Rutgers team. Fennelly, too, knows he cannot let up in his campaign for women’s basketball, that he must continue adding logs to the fire that Stringer ignited. After he took the Iowa State job in 1995, he said if there was an opening in his calendar, he would gladly fill it with a community appearance to talk up Cyclones women’s basketball. Thirteen years later, “it’s still the same,” Fennelly said. “It’s my responsibility to talk to the fans, to try to connect with them,” he said. More than 9,000 fans — most of them wearing Iowa State red — cheered the Cyclones to a 58-55 victory against Georgia Tech on Saturday, and a few thousand more are expected to attend Monday’s game. The stands may be awash in Iowa State colors, but many in the crowd will probably find it hard to root against Stringer. She has retained a large and loyal following among Iowans. Before the Scarlet Knights ’ first practice here, and again after their 85-42 first-round victory against Robert Morris, Stringer was besieged by autograph seekers. Many held open her recently published autobiography, “Standing Tall,” to the title page. Whenever she returns here, where her two brothers and sister still live, it is as if she never left. As Fennelly noted, “Her impact was immediate, dramatic and I think a continuing one in our state.” Stringer’s popularity here has not escaped the notice of her players. “I guess it will change tomorrow around 8:30,” the junior center Kia Vaughn said, referring to the local starting time of the game. With a mischievous smile, she added: “I know they still want her back. But they can’t have her.” And, for now, neither will men’s basketball.",

    "source": "Federal Court in Alabama Is Asked to Clear Way for Same-Sex Marriages <eos> ATLANTA — Lawyers for gay and civil rights groups on Friday asked a federal court in Mobile, Ala., to force the state’s probate judges to once again issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, three days after the Alabama Supreme Court ordered them to stop. The motion, filed with Judge Callie V.S. Granade of United States District Court, could trigger the next salvo in a showdown between state and federal judiciaries over same-sex marriage in one of the nation’s most conservative states. In its ruling Tuesday, the Alabama high court ruled that state law “allows for ‘marriage’ between only one man and one woman.’’ It came after a 22-day period in which gay and lesbian people could marry in some localities. The opening had been made possible by two rulings Judge Granade issued in late January that declared Alabama’s ban on same-sex marriage to be unconstitutional. Those rulings came in two cases in which same-sex couples challenged Alabama’s marriage restrictions. But opponents of same-sex marriage, including Chief Justice Roy Moore of the Alabama Supreme Court, have argued that Judge Granade’s rulings do not apply to the state’s probate judges — the local officials charged with issuing marriage licenses — because the probate judges were not named as defendants in the lawsuits. (Judge Granade later issued a ruling naming one of the probate judges, Don Davis, of Mobile County). Chief Justice Moore ordered the probate judges not to issue the licenses on Feb. 8, the day before Judge Granade’s rulings were to take effect. Amid the confusion, some probate judges issued licenses to gay couples while others did not. After the State Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday, all probate judges stopped issuing licenses to gay couples. Friday’s motion, filed by attorneys for the National Center for Lesbian Rights and other groups, seeks to solve that problem by asking Judge Granade to convert one of the cases into a class-action lawsuit. The lawyers are hoping the judge will allow them to name all of the state’s probate judges as a defendant class. And the motion asks that all of the same-sex couples wishing to marry in Alabama be named in addition to the four couples who are currently named as plaintiffs. It also asks the court to direct the probate judges to “refrain from enforcing all Alabama laws and orders that prohibit same-sex couples from marrying or that deny recognition of the marriages of same-sex couples.” Shannon Minter, the legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said he hoped the court would act quickly “to provide certainty to couples throughout the state and establish once and for all that Alabama’s same-sex couples have the freedom to marry.” The State Supreme Court’s ruling came after two conservative groups, the Alabama Policy Institute and the Alabama Citizens Action Program, filed a petition to stop gay marriage in the state. An attorney for the groups could not be reached for comment on Friday, nor could the president of the state probate judges’ association.",

    "source": "ICE Agents Crack Down on Protest at Varick Detention Center <eos> Agents in riot gear from Immigration and Customs Enforcement tried to break up a hunger strike by detainees at the Varick Federal Detention Center in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday, three detainees at the center said Wednesday in telephone interviews. Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security , denied that there was “a sustained hunger strike” at Varick, but said immigration agents entered and searched a jail dormitory when detainees complaining about conditions refused to leave it. A Jamaican detainee in one dorm said “all hell broke loose” after about 100 inmates refused to go to the mess hall on Tuesday morning and gave guards a flier declaring they were on a hunger strike to protest detention policies and practices. The detainee, who asked that his name not be published for fear of retaliation, said a SWAT team used pepper spray and “beat up” some detainees, took many to segregation cells as punishment and transferred about 17 to immigration jails in other states. The 20 detainees remaining in his dorm were threatened with similar treatment if they continued the hunger strike, he said. But Mr. Chandler, in a written statement, said, “No pepper spray was used at any time during this search, and any allegations of threat or intimidation are simply untrue.” Two detainees in another dorm said they had seen eight immigration agents in riot gear dragging two detainees from the far side of the jail, while at least eight other detainees were escorted toward the segregation unit. “After we started the hunger strike yesterday the SWAT team came into the other side,” Chao Chen, 36, a chef who is fighting deportation to China, said as his immigration lawyer, Chunyu Jean Wang, translated. “On our side a gentleman from immigration came and told them not to strike.” The third detainee, an architect who said he had been a legal resident for 30 years, gave a similar account, but he would not give his name. “I don’t want to be singled out,” he said. “A lot of things are happening in the night — people are being moved secretly.” Last week, the government announced that it would close the Varick jail and transfer all detainees to the Hudson County Correctional Facility in Kearny, N.J., by Feb. 28. The three detainees said that they opposed the transfer, but that the hunger strike was part of a broader protest over detention. According to the flier, the idea for the hunger strike originated at the Bergen County Jail, one of several in New Jersey where the federal government holds noncitizens while it tries to deport them, including legal immigrants with old criminal convictions, illegal immigrants and people seeking asylum. “We are seeking answers from President Obama ’s administration in immigration reform that he promised,” the one-page flier says, asking that detention and deportation be suspended for people with family members who are citizens or legal residents. “Although many of us have turned our lives around, building a family, contributing to society in many ways and living the American dream, in spite of that we are taken away from our love ones.” The flier echoes a hunger strike statement issued last week by detainees at the Port Isabel Detention Center in Texas.",

    "source": "In Africa, Clinton May Face a Kenyan Crisis <eos> NAIROBI, Kenya — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived in Kenya on Tuesday night at the beginning of an 11-day Africa tour and at a time when the American government is getting increasingly fed up with Kenya’s leaders. Mrs. Clinton was whisked from the airport to her hotel in downtown Nairobi, which was under intense security by soldiers wearing bulletproof vests and enormous men wearing earpieces. Her trip takes her through seven African nations, from Kenya to Cape Verde, and focuses on good government, trade and the bolstering of food security, all priorities that President Obama forcefully laid out during his quick visit to Ghana last month. She will meet with important commercial allies, including Angola and Nigeria, which export billions of dollars worth of oil to the United States. She will also wade into conflict zones like Congo, which continues to suffer and smolder from a decade-long civil war. But the first stop will not be easy. Mrs. Clinton is ostensibly in Kenya to address the eighth annual forum on the African Growth and Opportunity Act , a piece of trade legislation that her husband, Bill Clinton, passed when he was president. But she will inevitably be drawn into Kenya’s latest political crisis: what to do about the perpetrators of last year’s election-driven bloodshed. And more trouble may be brewing. Kenya faces a punishing drought, a food crisis, power cuts and ethnic militias mobilizing in the countryside, getting ready for a possible Round 2. Last week, Kenya’s leaders decided to scuttle efforts to set up a special tribunal for the organizers and financiers of the election violence , which killed more than 1,000 people, putting forward a vague pledge to try perpetrators within existing institutions instead. Some of the top suspects are high-ranking ministers, who are reluctant to set in motion any process that might put them behind bars. Many Kenyans are now calling their government of national unity the “government of national impunity.” Western nations, especially the United States, are losing patience, but at the same time, Kenya’s leaders seem to be getting annoyed by all the outside advice. “The United States is deeply concerned by the coalition government’s decision that appears to indicate it will not pursue establishment of an independent special tribunal to hold accountable perpetrators of postelection violence,” the American Embassy said Tuesday. “Failure by Kenya to take ownership of the process of accountability at all levels will call into serious question whether the political will exists to carry out fundamental reforms.” Last year, it was Mrs. Clinton’s predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, who applied the 11th-hour pressure on Kenya’s warring politicians and got them to sign a power-sharing agreement. But on Tuesday, Kenya’s prime minister, Raila Odinga , blasted back and said at the trade conference, “We don’t need another lecture.” He also blamed Western countries for creating Africa’s problems in the first place, saying many of the modern-day ills stemmed directly from colonialism.",

    "source": "F.C.C. Weighs Treating Video Sites Like Cable Companies <eos> BOSTON — Most consumers have no idea what an M.V.P.D. is, but they mail a check to one every month. What they call Comcast or Time Warner Cable or DirecTV, the government calls a “multichannel video programming distributor,” or M.V.P.D. for short. When that mouthful of a phrase was coined decades ago, it was pretty easy to identify what was a multichannel distributor — any cable or satellite company — and just as important, what wasn’t. But the Internet is changing that — so profoundly, in fact, that the Federal Communications Commission is now rethinking even the definition of the word “channel.” In a public comment period that ends in the coming weeks , the commission is asking whether the rules of multichannel distributors — like the right to carry certain popular channels and the responsibility to carry some less popular ones — should apply to new online distributors like Hulu and YouTube . If it decides that they should, then more companies could stream TV shows to computers and smartphones, hastening an industrywide shift to the Internet. “We recognize it’s going to have very, very broad implications,” said Austin Schlick, the F.C.C. general counsel, at a cable industry conference here on Tuesday. Many companies are urging the F.C.C. to move carefully, citing the pace of change in the media industry. The Internet has already changed what it means to publish, mail and copy — dictionaries certainly haven’t been able to keep up. “We’re barely into the second inning of how video distribution will ultimately work,” said Will Richmond, the editor of VideoNuze, an online publication that covers the industry. “Broadband delivery is leveling the playing field for new, deep-pocketed, over-the-top entrants to disrupt the traditional pay-TV model.” Going “over the top” means atop the Internet infrastructure provided by companies like Comcast. “Somebody’s going to come over the top” and sell a package of cable channels via the Internet at some point, David M. Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery Communications, predicted at the conference on Monday. He did not name any names, but Apple, Google, Sony and Intel, among others, have all at least considered such an offering. Those companies could theoretically give consumers new ways to buy bundles of programming, breaking open the cable model — though an incumbent cable or telecommunications company would most likely still need to provide Internet access. A change to the definition of multichannel distributor could make it easier for the companies to acquire programming, analysts say — which may explain why the incumbents have opposed any such change. This notion was tested a few years ago when a Christian media company called Sky Angel tried to add Mr. Zaslav’s Discovery Channel to the lineup of family-friendly channels that it sells over the Internet. Discovery did not want to sell, but if Sky Angel were legally deemed a multichannel distributor, it would have had to, under current rules. The F.C.C. staff initially sided with Discovery, but Sky Angel persisted and this spring, the commission decided to ask for input. That is when the panel asked for input: in this day and age, how should we be defining “M.V.P.D.” and “channel,” anyway? Suddenly, television executives and public interest lobbyists were doubling as lexicographers. “If the F.C.C. comes out the right way on this, it would make it possible for online services like Sky Angel to easily carry popular cable channels and broadcast TV,” said John Bergmayer, a staff lawyer for the public interest group Public Knowledge. “Video distribution could become much more diverse — Sky Angel is a Christian service, after all, and there’s no reason different groups shouldn’t be able to buy TV services tailored to their needs.” Mr. Bergmayer said Public Knowledge wanted the F.C.C. policies to enable more competition and “demonstrate that new entrants are welcome to try to reach viewers.” Major distributors like Comcast and Time Warner Cable want the definition of M.V.P.D. to remain rather narrow, to include only those who provide the transmission path for programming, like themselves. Some broadcasters, however, want the definition to be broadened to include online video sites, because then the sites would be subject to the same rules as cable operators, called retransmission consent, and would have to pay fees for their station signals. A number of online TV start-ups, including the Barry Diller-backed Aereo, are trying to sidestep these rules. Jack Perry of Syncbak, which helps stations simulcast their signals on the Web, said his company would be able to grow more rapidly if the F.C.C. adopted a “21st-century definition of M.V.P.D.’s.” “The impact could be huge,” he said. Still other stakeholders, including trade groups that represent giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Netflix, have said that the F.C.C. should take more time before deciding. In one of many such letters to the F.C.C., the Motion Picture Association of America cautioned that “even small changes to video programming regulations can have a far-reaching impact.” All this over a four-letter abbreviation — proof that every step toward online TV will be done with care.",

Their third straight victory, a 107-97 triumph Saturday night in Cleveland, moved them into a tie with the Cavaliers for 10th place in the woebegone Eastern Conference and left them three and a half games behind the free-falling Atlanta Hawks for the conference’s eighth and final playoff spot. The Knicks (24-40) should be able to extend their winning streak to four on Monday night when they host the Philadelphia 76ers, who are 15-47 and have lost 16 straight games. The Hawks have lost 14 of their last 15. They have also played three fewer games than the Knicks, which partly explains why they still lead the Knicks by five games in the loss column. Positioned between Atlanta and the Knicks are the Detroit Pistons (24-38), who are one game ahead of the Knicks. In the spirit of the Eastern Conference, the Pistons have lost 9 of their last 11. For the Knicks, all of this presents an opportunity. They led, 58-50, at halftime Saturday, but the Cavaliers fought back and took an 80-77 lead early in the fourth quarter. But four 3-pointers by the Knicks in less than three minutes — two by Pablo Prigioni, one by J. R. Smith and one by Carmelo Anthony — allowed the Knicks to pull away.

    "source": "Missouri Police Cite Threats in Deciding Not to Name Officer Who Shot Teenager <eos> FERGUSON, Mo. — The chief of police here said Tuesday that he had reconsidered his decision to release the name of the police officer involved in the fatal shooting of an unarmed African-American teenager and would not do so because of concerns about the officer’s safety. The Ferguson Police Department had said it would release the officer’s name by noon on Tuesday, but then it reversed itself after it said that threats had been made on social media against the officer and the city’s police. “The value of releasing the name is far outweighed by the risk of harm to the officer and his family,” the police chief, Thomas Jackson, said in announcing a decision that was quickly criticized. The officer has been placed on administrative leave. The change came amid another day of protests in the St. Louis suburbs where the teenager, Michael Brown, 18, was shot several times on Saturday by an officer as he and a friend walked from a convenience store. The circumstances remain in dispute. The police say Mr. Brown hit the officer and tried to steal his gun; Mr. Brown’s family and friends deny that. Image Residents gathered at Greater St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church in Dellwood, Mo., on Tuesday to mourn Michael Brown, a teenager shot dead by the police in nearby Ferguson on Saturday. 1 / 7 The F.B.I. has opened a civil rights inquiry into the shooting, and the case is being investigated by the St. Louis County Police. The results of an autopsy on Mr. Brown have not been released. The protests have at times turned violent: Stores have been looted, and at least one business was set on fire. The police have made more than 40 arrests since Sunday and fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. A gathering on Tuesday night turned into another skirmish with police officers, who used tear gas to disperse the remnants of a bigger crowd. Two shooting incidents were also reported nearby, but authorities told local media that it was unclear whether they were related to the protest. In one incident, a woman was injured in what appeared to be a drive-by shooting. In the other, the local media reported that police shot a man who had pulled a gun on an officer. Police, according to media reports, were responding to reports of several men with guns and wearing ski masks. During a peaceful protest march on Tuesday to the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office in Clayton, Mo., the seat of St. Louis County, demonstrators chanted “Don’t shoot!” and raised their hands over their heads — the pose they say Mr. Brown was in when he was shot. Michael Brown’s Shooting and Its Immediate Aftermath in Ferguson Updates on the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., that followed the shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed teenager, by a police officer on Aug. 9. Also Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration barred aircraft from flying below 3,000 feet over Ferguson. The county police department had asked the agency to issue the ban on Monday after its helicopters were shot at “a couple of different times,” Officer Brian Schellman, a department spokesman, said. President Obama, in his first comments about the shooting, called the death of Mr. Brown heartbreaking but urged residents to remain calm. “I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions,” the president said in a statement on Tuesday, “but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Mo., and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.” In an interview on Tuesday with MSNBC , Dorian Johnson, a friend of Mr. Brown’s, gave a description of the shooting. He said that he and Mr. Brown had been walking in the street when an officer drove up and told them to get onto the sidewalk. The two stayed in the street after telling the officer that they were close to Mr. Johnson’s house. The officer, who had passed them, then backed up, almost hitting them in doing so. He then tried to open his door, which hit Mr. Brown, and when the door bounced shut, the officer reached out and grabbed Mr. Brown. “Mike was trying to get away from being choked,” Mr. Johnson told MSNBC. At that point, he said, the officer pulled a gun and fired, striking Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown “did not reach for the officer’s weapon at all,” he said. Image Lesley McSpadden, the mother of Michael Brown, held a drawing of the two of them after a news conference in St. Louis on Tuesday. Mr. Brown, 18, was shot and killed Saturday in a confrontation with the police in Ferguson, Mo. Credit Whitney Curtis for The New York Times Mr. Johnson said that he and Mr. Brown began to run, and while he ducked behind a car, Mr. Brown kept going. After Mr. Brown was shot a second time, Mr. Johnson said, he turned to face the officer with his hands up, the officer fired several more shots, and Mr. Brown fell. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing the Brown family, said Tuesday that Mr. Johnson had yet to be called in for questioning by the police and wanted to speak only to federal authorities. “He does not trust the local law enforcement community,” Mr. Crump said. “How could he? He saw his friend executed.” Mr. Crump, who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager who was shot and killed by a neighborhood-watch volunteer in Florida in 2012, criticized the Ferguson police chief’s decision not to reveal the name of the officer who killed Mr. Brown. He said it only deepened the mistrust among blacks in the city, which is about two-thirds African-American but has a police force that is predominately white. Image Police officers in riot gear confronted a man Monday night during a protest in Ferguson, Mo., over the shooting of a black teenager, Michael Brown, over the weekend. 1 / 10 Chief Jackson said a provision of state law allowed police departments to withhold an officer’s name if there were concerns about personal safety. Normally, a department has 72 hours to disclose a name. The rash of threats on social media, Chief Jackson said, led to his decision. He said he had also ordered his officers to ride two to a car because rocks were being thrown at patrol cars. The Rev. Al Sharpton, at a news conference on Tuesday in St. Louis with the Brown family, called for an end to the violence in Ferguson. “Some of us are making the story about how mad we are,” he said. “To become violent in Michael Brown’s name is to betray the gentle giant that he was.” Michael Brown Sr., the victim’s father, echoed that sentiment. “I need justice for my son,” he said. Later, a crowd gathered outside a church where members of the Brown family appeared with Mr. Sharpton. Many people urged calm, reminding one another that television cameras were present; some people made sure others did not spill into the streets. “Stay on the sidewalks,” one man said. “The whole world is watching.”",

    "source": "ISIS Vote Weighs Heavily on Senators With 2016 Ambitions <eos> The Senate vote set for late Thursday afternoon on whether to allow the American military to arm and train Syrian rebels will be a display of how hard-learned lessons from the past and uncertainties about the future — both practical and political — are at work, especially for those with an eye on a promotion. Congress is home to numerous men and women with White House ambitions in 2016 and beyond. As the experiences of their contemporaries have shown, being on the wrong side of history can end those hopes, just as it has for other senators who have had their votes on issues of war and peace come back to haunt them. Consider Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose vote for the invasion of Iraq opened a lane for the candidacy of Barack Obama in 2008, or John Kerry, whose campaign for president in 2004 was hurt by the perception that he had tried to straddle his vote for the invasion with his later criticism of it. Senators who hope to run for higher office were carefully considering their votes this week. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has been trying to fight off attacks from other Republicans who say he would be a liability as a presidential candidate because of his less-interventionist views, was expected to vote no. How ISIS Works With oil revenues, arms and organization, the jihadist group controls vast stretches of Syria and Iraq and aspires to statehood. \\ In a speech before the vote on Thursday, Mr. Paul tried to square his belief that America cannot be the world’s policeman with his more hawkish statements lately in support of military action. “I’m not sending your son, your daughter over to the middle of that chaos,” he said. “The people who live there need to stand up and fight. I am not giving up. But it is their war, and they need to fight.” Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who is considering a presidential campaign in 2016, denounced the president’s foreign policy in a speech to a group of conservatives. “Previous presidents had merely taken their foot off the gas pedal of American strength,” he said. “But President Obama has stomped on the brake.” Mr. Rubio’s considerations, like those of others looking toward 2016, reflected the complicated dynamics. Though he has deep misgivings about the president’s policies, he was expected to vote yes because he wants to back the military response. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, another possible Republican presidential contender, was set to vote no. “I do not support arming the rebels in Syria because the administration has presented no coherent plan for distinguishing the good guys from the bad guys,” he said in an interview on Wednesday. Mrs. Clinton was on constant defense in the 2008 presidential campaign about her vote to authorize the Iraq war in 2002, when she was a senator from New York. By contrast, Mr. Obama’s outspoken opposition to the war when he was a senator helped define his candidacy and cast him as a fresh, forward-looking alternative who got it right the first time. Iraqi Army Retakes Government Complex in Central Ramadi Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State. In 2004, Mr. Kerry constantly had to try to explain away his remark that he was for financing the Iraq war before he was against it. The candidates in 2016 will also have to contend with a public sentiment that has only grown since 2008: that American forces should stay out of dangerous and unpredictable foreign conflicts. The vote on Thursday will also be the last major action that the Senate takes before the midterm elections in November. Senators in tough races were struggling this week to decide whether to back the president’s request. Senator Mark Begich of Alaska, one of the most endangered Democrats, had said he would vote no. Senator Mark Udall of Colorado, a Democrat who is within a few points of his Republican opponent in many polls, announced on Wednesday that, after much consideration, he would vote with the president. “ISIL must be stopped,” he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State. Then there are the Democrats who are deeply reluctant to see the United States become entangled in another Middle East conflict. Many of them opposed the Iraq war in 2002 and remain unconvinced that the president’s plan is the right course of action. “I have so many questions,” said Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat who voted against the Iraq war as a House member in 2002. Given how unpredictable the situation is in Syria and Iraq, she said, how can the president guarantee that American involvement will not escalate? “How will we know?” she asked. “I worry about an open-ended conflict.”",

    "source": "S.&P. Has More Than Doubled Under Obama <eos> IN the 84 years that the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has been calculated, it doubled during the terms of only four presidents before Barack Obama’s election in 2008. This month that number rose to five as the index climbed to more than twice what it was when he took office. Through Friday, more than 52 months after he took office, the index was up 105 percent during his term in office, for a compound annual gain of 18 percent. There is, of course, more than a little good fortune in that statistic. Mr. Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009, in the middle of a credit crisis that had caused prices to plunge and would cause them to keep falling for a few more weeks. It helps to start from a very low level. It also helps to have a central bank that drove short-term interest rates to zero, a step that both increased corporate profits and made bonds less attractive investments. In fact, the United States stock market fell from record high levels this week, and world markets quavered, in part because of comments made by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, that the Fed might be able to begin to back off from its aggressive monetary stance later this year. Even with this week’s dip, however, the United States market has done better since early 2009 than any of the next nine largest economies in the world, as can be seen in the accompanying charts. Those charts reflect MSCI indexes, based in dollars, in each country except the United States, where the S.& P. 500 is used. The United States market lagged many others early in the recovery. But as its economy kept growing, albeit slowly, and European economies faltered and worries grew that emerging economies might experience slower growth, the American market overtook the others. Of the next nine — ranked on the size of the economies in 2009, only India’s market came close to the performance of the United States market since early 2009. Like the Chinese and Brazilian markets, it excelled early on but is now well below the peak it hit in 2011. If you put your dollars into the Italian or Spanish stock markets when Mr. Obama took office, your shares would now be worth less than you paid for them. Over all, the world’s stock markets outside the United States have risen less than two-thirds as much as the American one has. The Wall Street performance has not made Mr. Obama particularly popular among financiers. Indeed, some of the language about the president’s perceived support of socialism and hostility to capitalism during last year’s campaign was the harshest seen in any campaign since 1936, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was seeking a second term and was strongly opposed by many financiers. By the time Mr. Roosevelt died in 1945, the S.& P. 500 was 141 percent higher than it had been when he took office. But he was in office so long that the annual rate of gain was only 7.5 percent, less than half of the rate so far for the Obama administration. The other presidents whose term in office included a doubling in the S.& P. were Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Each served two full terms, and none came close to the average annual gain so far under Mr. Obama. Mr. Clinton’s 15.2 percent was the highest of that group. He had the good fortune to enter office when markets were relatively low and to leave just as the technology stock bubble was starting to collapse. There is, of course, no guarantee that a market that rises will endure. Mr. Roosevelt’s record would be better if he had left after one term in office; the market was lower when he died in 1945 than it had been when he took the oath of office in 1937 for his second term. And the president with the best stock market record in the 20th century — using the Dow Jones industrial average, whose history is longer than that of the S.& P. — is Calvin Coolidge. The Dow rose 256 percent — an annual rate of 25.5 percent — from his inauguration in 1923 until he left office in early 1929. The market went up an additional 20 percent before the crash. But by the end of 1931 all of the Coolidge gains had been lost.",

    "source": "Learning to Live With the Airline Bag Fee <eos> Americans seem to be enamored of change these days. And despite the cries of protests when airlines started charging for checked luggage, it seems baggage fees are a change we can live with after all. With winter weather causing major disruptions at airports across the nation, air travelers are still facing challenges. But the bag fees proved to be less of a headache than many expected, especially for business travelers . “Business travelers tend to be among those that are more likely to qualify for exemptions, either through premium status or traveling on a full-fare ticket,” said Tim Smith, a spokesman for American Airlines, who added that the new policy had caused few bumps. “By all accounts it’s gone smoother than we anticipated,” he said. “Our biggest concern was that we might see people trying to take things that were inappropriate as carry-ons, but it hasn’t been a big problem.” About half of American’s domestic passengers check luggage. But the average number of checked items has fallen from 1.2 per customer to less than one bag, mostly due to fewer people checking two bags, Mr. Smith said. Luggage fees have settled at around $15 for the first checked bag and $25 for the second one, each way. Most airlines waive their luggage fees for elite frequent fliers, passengers in first or business class, customers who purchase full-fare economy tickets and those traveling on government or military fares. In addition, Continental gives customers who use its co-branded Chase credit and debit cards one free checked bag, and that benefit is extended to anyone listed in the same reservation as the card holder who checks in at the same time. Other airlines offer discounts to passengers who pay their luggage fees online: Spirit Airlines gives $10 off the first checked bag to those who prepay on its Web site, while United is offering a 20 percent discount on its first bag fee to customers who pay online through Jan. 31, 2009. So far, Alaska Airlines, JetBlue and Virgin America are among the holdouts that still allow passengers one free checked bag, while Southwest still allows two free checked items. But passengers who do not fall into any of the privileged categories can still avoid fees. How? Travel light. As obvious as it sounds, traveling light — the old-fashioned obsession of many a frequent flier to reduce frustration — can reduce fees as well. Some frequent fliers have gotten packing light down to a science. “I had a trip to Germany and I was very proud of myself because I was able to do it with just a carry-on,” said Brian Lynch, who works for a manufacturer based in Elmsford, N.Y. Since he has elite status, Mr. Lynch’s packing light has nothing to do with fees, but with fear. In 2004, his checked luggage was lost 17 times. “I applied to the Guinness Book of World Records,” he said. “But I didn’t get it because until I recognized that this was an amusing pattern I didn’t save any of the receipts.” Although he always got his luggage back, he became a convert to the carry-on-only credo. Like many of his breed, he dreaded that the new luggage charges would cause cabin chaos but he hasn’t experienced that problem. “Maybe the airlines have just insulated their best customers,” he said. Perhaps not all their best customers. Nick Pandher, who works in sales for a technology company near Los Angeles, disagrees. “The overheads are really crowded,” he said. “I’ve seen many flights where they’re ready to close the door but they have to deal with bags.” Mr. Pandher said he travels with only a carry-on, packing half the clothes he needs and relying on laundry services to get through longer trips. He also avoids checking the demonstration kit he takes to client meetings, opting to ship it rather than dealing with the airport inconvenience and airline fees — which can be $100 or more extra for an oversize or overweight bag. “We just use FedEx now,” he said. “It’s $200 but we don’t have to worry about it getting there or schlepping it through the airport.” Indeed, the slow handling of checked luggage seems to be more of a deterrent than the fees, which most business travelers can put on their expense accounts anyway. “If they’re going to charge people to check baggage, they need to guarantee some kind of timeliness,” Mr. Pandher said. Another frustration for passengers is increased scrutiny of the number and size of carry-on bags. Brian Warner and his wife were passing through security at San Francisco International Airport in November when an employee — who was not wearing an airline or Transportation Security Administration uniform — asked his wife to prove her rolling suitcase was within the size limit by placing it in a metal template. “It had inches to spare,” Mr. Warner said. “It was mildly annoying.” Although he and his wife have elite status and would sometimes prefer to check luggage without charge, they generally don’t, as a result of having waited 45 minutes at the carousel in Seattle. “We’ve traveled as long as a month just with carry-ons,” he said. “We’ll go to those lengths just to avoid checking because of those nightmares.” Corey Caldwell, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants, said the extra carry-ons were proving to be a problem for flight attendants who “have to work harder to make sure that they fit in the overhead bins.”",

    "source": "Michigan State Quarterback Connor Cook Carves a Legacy With Pluck and Persistence <eos> DALLAS — Alabama’s defense led the Football Bowl Subdivision with 46 sacks this season, but the Crimson Tide seemed to try to surpass that total in compliments directed at Michigan State quarterback Connor Cook on Monday. A few players likened Cook to the Denver Broncos’ Peyton Manning for his ability to read defenses and adjust play calls. Alabama’s defensive coordinator, Kirby Smart, compared Cook to the Atlanta Falcons’ Matt Ryan (when Ryan played at Boston College) and called Cook “by far” the best quarterback the No. 2 Tide (12-1) would face this season. “We’re not going to put a defense out there now that Connor Cook hasn’t seen,” Smart said. “It’s not about tricking him. There is not a throw that he can’t make. He makes decisions so quick.” Cook sealed his legacy in East Lansing Mich., by leading the No. 3 Spartans (12-1) to their second Big Ten championship in three years and a berth in Thursday night’s College Football Playoff semifinal in Arlington, Tex., with the winner advancing to play Clemson or Oklahoma for the national title. Hyperbole aside, the truth about Cook’s talents will be determined largely by Crimson Tide defenders who have treated most quarterbacks like human piñatas and forced opponents to pass at their peril. Cook seemed slightly uncomfortable with all the praise, but his witty and engaging personality smoothly moved along the conversation. As a senior with a 34-4 record in three years as a starter, he certainly was not going to be rattled in a hotel ballroom. “I think he’s kind of playing it down a little bit,” Spartans center Jack Allen said. “He’s a perfectionist. At practice, you see guys, they make a mistake, it’s like they shrug it off as practice. But he’ll make a mistake, and it’s like it happened in the game.” Cook’s style has been broken down into contradictions: He is accurate but does not have a gunslinger’s arm strength; he seldom outmaneuvers defenders, yet his footwork and clutch runs fueled a 22-play drive to beat Iowa in the final seconds of the Big Ten title game. “I’m not a dual threat by any means,” Cook said. “But a quarterback that I admire a lot is Tom Brady, even though he went to Michigan.” Cook explained later that he was not comparing himself to Brady, a four-time champion with the New England Patriots. When Cook arrived at Michigan State as a freshman, though, he did want to fit the mold of Kirk Cousins, a former Spartans star now with the Washington Redskins. “There were times in practice where the ball wouldn’t touch the ground,” Cook said, recalling Cousins’s workouts. “Every single ball was just right here, in the catch radius for every receiver. He was always making the right read; he was always putting in extra time in the film room. I just saw the way he carried himself on the field, off the field. “I thought, ‘Man, if I ever want to start one game here, I’ve got a lot of improvement to do.’ My goal was just to get better every single year, and with the first opportunity I got, I was going to go out there and grasp it and never look back.” Cook, who won the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award and tied for ninth in the Heisman Trophy voting, needs 148 passing yards to eclipse Cousins’s Michigan State career record, 9,131. Cook has also thrown for 24 touchdowns this season, one shy of Cousins’s record. “He wants to win more than anybody on the team,” wide receiver Aaron Burbridge said of Cook. “He’ll go out there, make a mistake, bounce right back and win the game for us.” Burbridge added: “I think he has the same competitive drive as Tom Brady. Those long drives in the fourth quarter, you know he’s going to get the job done. It’s not just the arm and legs; it’s the drive to win.” Like many Spartans, Cook was not highly rated as a recruit out of high school. Michigan State put Cook on its radar when he was a sophomore at Walsh Jesuit High in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, where Pat Narduzzi, a Spartans assistant who is now Pittsburgh’s head coach, went to recruit another player. Cook was asked to help by throwing passes in the basketball gym for five minutes. “I’m some skinny sophomore probably throwing lollipops,” Cook recalled. Soon, he was receiving letters from Michigan State every week. When Cook threw 14 interceptions and only nine touchdown passes as a high school junior, he figured that his hopes of playing in the Big Ten were finished. “But I still got these letters from Michigan State,” Cook said. “Week after week. I’m thinking, ‘Why do they keep sending me these?’ ” Cook marveled at how the Spartans had kept faith in a three-star recruit they found by happenstance. “We’ve got guys who aren’t super highly recruited,” he said. “The coaching staff here is just very good at evaluating talent and getting guys that want to come in and are good players with good character.” Cook took Alabama’s compliments in stride. Now he wants to avoid those Crimson Tide sacks. “I just go out there and play,” Cook said.",

    "source": "Match-Play Event Brings Risks for Top 4 in Ranking <eos> MARANA, Ariz., — For one week each year, the normally staid golf governing bodies comprising the International Federation of PGA Tours step outside the lines and throw down some fairly risky behavior. This is that week, a week when the format is match play and the stakes are higher than only the $8 million purse at the Accenture Match Play Championship at The Gallery at Dove Mountain. The added element of risk in the risk-reward ratio starting Wednesday is this: For the first time this year, Tiger Woods , Phil Mickelson , Steve Stricker and Ernie Els , the Nos. 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-ranked golfers in the world, are playing at the same time — but all could be gone after one round. All the actuarial tables say it will not happen. But how many tables would have predicted that the No. 1 seed would have won only twice in nine years or that Nos. 1, 2 and 3 would all go down in the first round in 2002 or that 51-year-old Jay Haas would defeat then-No. 1 Vijay Singh, as happened in 2005? “You can go out there and shoot six or seven under par and you’re going home,” said Woods, who has won this event twice and who also lost in the first round in 1999. “Other times, I remember at LaCosta, one of the matches one of the guys shot 80 and advanced. It’s just the way it is. It’s match play.” That it is. Every single 18-hole match is a tournament, with a winner and a loser, a do-or-die adrenaline-laced contest. Normally, touring professionals do not think about what their competitors are doing until Sunday of a tournament, and then only if they are near the lead. In this event, and in two others on the PGA European Tour and the biennial Ryder Cup and President’s Cup, there is a Sunday shot of adrenaline every day. “All you have to do is beat one guy,” Woods said. “Just beat the guy you’re playing against, no matter how.” That head-to-head aspect of match play is one reason for its visceral appeal. Golf, in effect, becomes like a civilized form of boxing or dueling with pistols at 20 paces. Without the injuries, of course. Here the only bruises are to the players’ egos, and they are assuaged by the $40,000 check for a first-round loss. “It’s kind of do or die here,” said Adam Scott, a 27-year-old Australian who analyzed the differences between the first round of a regular stroke-play event and match play. “Even if I don’t play well on Thursday, I can get myself back into the tournament by Sunday, whereas here you’d better bring it every day. “Otherwise likely you’re probably going home because you’ve got the top 65 guys in the world here.” The finality of elimination in match play brings a pain that lingers, regardless of the round in which it occurs. Scott was one and done last year, losing to Shaun Micheel in 21 holes in the first round. In 2003, Scott lost in the semifinals to Woods. What does he consider his worst defeat? “Losing to Tiger that one year,” he said, five years later. Half the contestants will be gone by Wednesday, and the field will be whittled by 50 percent each day until only two golfers are left standing. Along the way, there will be some compelling theater out on the 7,466 yards of the Gallery. The dream scenario of sponsors and fans is that Woods and Mickelson will work their way through their sections of the draw to face each other Sunday. That would be the first time in the history of the event when No. 1 played No. 2 in the finals. The nearest thing to that came in the finals of 2004, when the No. 1, Woods, defeated the No. 3, Davis Love, 3 and 2. Woods is on a mission. He has four straight victories, the last at the Dubai Desert Classic. He has not lost since finishing second at the Deutsche Bank almost six months ago. He has the stated objective of winning the Grand Slam this year. If he wants to stay undefeated in a year for the first time since he went 36-0 in junior golf when he was 11, he will have to get past J. B. Holmes in the first match and then beat whoever wins the Mike Weir-Arron Oberholser match. Looming down the line on Woods’s side of the draw is Rory Sabbatini. If he and Woods win three matches, they will play each other Saturday. There are many ifs in any scenario predicting how the matches will unfold. One that is certain is this: There will be some casualties among the favored players in the first round. No first round in the nine-year history of the event has had fewer than 11 upsets. The folks at Accenture, who have signed on through 2010 as the sponsors, are definitely hoping there is not a repeat of 2002, when the top three were gone after one round. Odds are there will not be. But, as the players all know, in match play anything can happen.",

    "source": "New Player in E.U. Data Privacy Battle <eos> BERLIN — In the mid-1990s, Alan Shatter, a lawyer from South Dublin in the lower house of Parliament, played a role in bringing together diverse elements of society to lift a constitutional ban and legalize divorce. This January, when Ireland assumes the rotating presidency of the European Union , Mr. Shatter, who is now Ireland’s minister of justice, equality and defense, will take on another big challenge: putting together an agreement to extend the Union’s 17-year-old data protection law to Web businesses and the digital economy. Mr. Shatter is Ireland’s lead negotiator on the issue in the Council of Ministers, the legislative body in Brussels that acts as the European Parliament’s upper house. The Union’s 27 members are at odds over how to apply E.U. data protection laws in the digital world, and an agreement could require companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Amazon to provide the bloc’s 503.7 million consumers with far greater control over their online data than people have in the United States. An important part of the proposal, which is now before two committees in the European Parliament, would require Web companies to ask E.U. citizens for their explicit consent before collecting online data and tracking Internet activity used to tailor marketing and advertising to individuals. The proposal, which was drafted by Viviane Reding, the vice president of the European Commission, has been welcomed by E.U. privacy regulators, who are battling Google over its data collection practices. But it is opposed by many large Web businesses, as well as by the American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union. Opponents view the prior consent clause as an onerous condition that threatens an Internet financial model that relies on advertising to pay for content. That has raised concerns among E.U. lawmakers, who are afraid that overly burdensome regulation would stifle Internet commerce and job growth. Into this predicament steps Mr. Shatter, 61. In an interview, he said that he looked forward to working on advancing the data protection proposal, which has been packaged as a “regulation,” a rarely used binding form of E.U. law that would take effect immediately upon adoption in Brussels and apply to all 27 member countries. “There is a need to improve trust and confidence to reassure people that their personal data won’t be misused,” Mr. Shatter said. “Putting stronger data protection standards in place will make individual citizens across Europe more trustful of the technology and its use.” Mr. Shatter said he would aim for a compromise that recognized the growing importance of the digital economy to the European Union, as well as the need for hard-and-fast legal protections for E.U. citizens, who are increasingly making their purchases and many everyday decisions via the Internet. Without privacy constraints, those movements online can be tracked. “I think it is possible to reconcile the legitimate and economically important activities of the advertising industry with privacy issues,” he said. “I don’t think we can commoditize individuals and simply regard them as something of business value to be sold on.” Such strict new rules would replace a law from 1995, which was conceived as more of a legal directive that effectively limited the possibilities of wide-scale data mining for direct marketing or other commercial purposes. Because of the existing law’s optional nature and a loophole allowing companies to collect data for “legitimate interests,” Internet companies have been able largely to evade the directive’s principle of obtaining prior consent. Mr. Shatter has been part of a lot of groundbreaking. His law firm, Gallagher Shatter, was the first in Ireland to represent and win a civil judgment for a victim of sexual abuse by a Catholic priest, which it did in the early 1990s. Mr. Shatter, who is also a trained professional mediator — a skill that could serve him well — has published several books on Irish family law, as well as the 1989 novel “Laura,” a story about a custody battle involving a fictional politician. But obtaining a consensus in the Council of Ministers, whose cooperation is important to passage of a revised data protection law, will not be easy, said Simon Davies, a founder of Privacy International, an advocacy group based in London, and a lecturer at the London School of Economics. Mr. Davies is advising the European Parliament on the legislation. “The problem is not that the will to reform isn’t there. It is,” Mr. Davies said. “Everyone agrees in principle that we need to do this, but the devil is in the details. When you move into the details you find major ideological divides on both sides.” Ireland, with its educated work force and 15 percent corporate income tax rate, has become the European base for U.S. technology giants, including Microsoft, Facebook and Google. In the past, the country’s data protection commissioners have attempted to mediate disputes over privacy issues between data protection hard-liners from Germany and France, and those advocating less regulation, like Britain. Mr. Shatter said Ireland had a “pivotal role” to play in resolving outstanding online privacy issues. Final adoption of a new data protection law is unlikely to take place before the second half of next year, when Ireland will no longer hold the E.U. presidency. At best, Mr. Shatter can aim to win consensus on the main issues: prior consent and an effective enforcement mechanism that relies on substantial fines. Mr. Shatter said the prior consent requirement was essential for the law to gain political backing, as were details on how to penalize companies financially if they ignored the law. Currently, most national regulators can levy limited fines of only a few thousand, or in rare cases, a few hundred thousand, euros, the equivalent of a rounding error in the profits of many global technology companies. The current proposal puts more bite into those penalties, allowing regulators to assess fines of as much as 2 percent of a company’s annual sales. “Without a legal regime that provides sanctions for rule breaking, rules won’t generally be complied with by some of those engaged in Web-based businesses,” Mr. Shatter said, without endorsing specific levels of fines. That may not sound appealing to Web businesses, but Mr. Shatter is an optimist. His political slogan on his personal Web site is: Look forward with hope.",

    "source": "Calipari Launches Into Coachspeak as Kentucky Grabs No. 1 Ranking <eos> LEXINGTON, Ky. — On a drizzling afternoon this week, Kentucky Coach John Calipari stood on a practice court and reminded his players that nothing comes easy. “Do you understand me?” he said. “Are you listening?” These have been heady times for Kentucky. Ranked No. 1, with a 6-0 record, it has all seemed so easy so far for Calipari’s squad. Especially considering that the Wildcats are led by three highly regarded freshmen — point guard Marquis Teague, power forward Anthony Davis and small forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist — whose careers have known only success. Yet, this week, as they prepared to face visiting St. John’s on Thursday night before a showdown with No. 5 North Carolina on Saturday, Calipari made sure his players understood the challenge. Calipari posed his questions Monday, after Kentucky rose to the top ranking , thanks to a loss by the Tar Heels. What came next was more than two hours of intense practice. The pattern was the same Tuesday. “I’ve been tough on them,” Calipari said Wednesday. “Not in a mean way, but just raising the bar to get them to forget that other stuff. Forget ranking. It’s a nice badge of honor, but that badge is a target for someone else. Let’s just worry about getting better.” Calipari worked on the team’s offense and drilled the Wildcats on the importance of being in synch, of mastering plays then flawlessly executing. “We have a long way to go, both individual players and as a team,” he said. “There are things they don’t know and you can’t cover it all until you see it in a game. With young players like this, you’ve got to make them feel that we’re as good as anybody, but you want that swagger based on hard work and demonstrated performance, that they go on the court and perform.” St. John’s has even less experience than Kentucky, with a highly praised recruiting class still adjusting to the rigors of the college game. A 78-64 loss to Northeastern last Saturday dropped the Red Storm to 4-3. “We’re still in a phase of teaching our system,” the assistant coach Mike Dunlap said. “We have to keep our focus and temperament where it belongs, and that’s on improvement.” The Red Storm have been without Coach Steve Lavin for extended periods this season as he continues to recover from surgery Oct. 6 for prostate cancer. He will remain in New York on Thursday, and Dunlap will assume his role. Still, St. John’s, which will be visiting Rupp Arena for the first time since 1985, has enough talent to pose a challenge for Kentucky. “We’re not looking past them at all,” said Teague, who struggled in the season’s first four games, with 18 turnovers and 11 assists. “They’re going to come in with a lot of energy and they’re going to come in hungry.” It will be the first true road game of the season for St. John’s, which is led by players like God’sgift Achiuwa, first on the Red Storm with 58.1 percent shooting; D’Angelo Harrison, who has made 13 3-pointers; and Moe Harkless, first on the team in blocked shots and rebounds. Calipari said: “They’re young, but they’re athletic and active. You’re going to see a team that’s trying to steal every ball, that dives on the floor, that takes charges. It’s going to be a good challenge.” The last time the teams met, it was the 2001 season opener, played at Madison Square Garden and won by St. John’s, 62-61. As for the Red Storm’s record against top teams, they have five victories over a No. 1 team. The last came during the 1984-85 season, when they beat Georgetown, 66-65. Still, St. John’s is traveling to Kentucky with the confidence of youth. “We’re going to go down there,” Dunlap said, “and see if we can do something special.”",

    "source": "New Jersey Senate Vote on Gay Marriage Is Postponed <eos> TRENTON — The battle over a bill that would legalize gay marriage in New Jersey shifted locations unexpectedly late Wednesday as sponsors of the legislation canceled a vote scheduled for Thursday in the State Senate, where the measure appeared headed for defeat. The sponsors, Senators Raymond J. Lesniak and Loretta Weinberg, both Democrats, withdrew the bill from the agenda in the Senate session, saying they wanted to first allow a hearing in the General Assembly, where support for same-sex marriage is believed to be stronger. But opponents were outraged by the last-minute switch and accused Democrats of abusing their leadership positions to force a controversial issue through the Legislature during the waning days of the session. The bill was passed narrowly on Monday by a Senate committee. “It makes a mockery of the legislative process,” said John Tomicki, president of the New Jersey Coalition to Preserve and Protect Marriage. “They’re using the Legislature as a propaganda tool. They didn’t have the courage to bring the issue up before the election, and now they’re playing games to do things that the public doesn’t approve of at the very last minute.” Ms. Weinberg, of Bergen County, brushed aside accusations that the postponement was a tactical maneuver to avert defeat in the Senate, saying that the issue had generated so much public interest that residents deserved more time to give it thorough consideration. The Senate Judiciary Committee took testimony from scores of residents during a marathon seven-hour hearing on Monday, Ms. Weinberg said, but still had to turn away 150 others who had signed up to speak. “We think this is the fairest way to proceed, and anybody on the other side can say whatever they want to say,” Ms. Weinberg said. The switch to the Assembly is likely to increase the frenetic lobbying over the issue, which has already intensified in the past few days. Gay rights activists are pressing to win legislative approval before Jan. 19 — when Gov. Jon S. Corzine, a Democrat who staunchly supports same-sex marriage, is replaced by Governor-elect Christopher J. Christie, a Republican who opposes the measure. In recent weeks, hundreds of activists, clergy members and citizens-turned-advocates from both sides of the issue have been pressuring lawmakers, pleading their case from phone banks and pulpits, at rallies and in private meetings. By Tuesday night, the whirlwind had reached the unlikely outpost of Firehouse No. 1 in West Windsor — a quiet enclave — where opponents of the measure demonstrated outside a birthday party being held by State Senator William Baroni, the lone Republican who has said he plans to support it. Carrying signs declaring, “God says no, Baroni votes yes” and “Phony Baloney Baroni,” a half-dozen demonstrators called out to passing motorists and party guests, warning the senator that constituents would hold him accountable for his vote. “The Bible is very clear that marriage is between a man and a woman, and homosexuality is a sin,” said Bob Pawson, who said he is a longtime friend of Mr. Baroni’s and has volunteered on his campaigns. “So to promote this lifestyle — it’s actually a death style — is sending the wrong message.” Mr. Baroni, a Roman Catholic, said he respected the demonstrators’ right to air their views, but nonetheless intended to vote for the marriage bill because he considered it a matter of civil rights. “I have never voted for discrimination, and I’m not about to start now,” he said. The Assembly speaker, Joseph J. Roberts Jr., a Democrat from Camden, welcomed the chance to debate the bill, but said he was not certain when a hearing would be scheduled. Mr. Roberts said that gay men and lesbians deserved the right to marry because the state’s civil union law was inadequate.",

    "source": "A Review of ‘Winfred Rembert: Amazing Grace,’ at the Hudson River Museum <eos> Most histories of the segregated South and the civil rights movement have taken the form of books, films or music. Winfred Rembert’s is carved in leather. You could call it folk art, since he wasn’t trained in any art school — he learned the craft in prison — and like many folk narratives, it is couched firmly in the details of simple, everyday life. But the work on view at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, which has distinct echoes of Jacob Lawrence , Elizabeth Catlett , Romare Bearden and Mexican revolutionary art, also offers a harrowing account of one man’s odyssey through the Jim Crow South. For Mr. Rembert, the odyssey begins with fond memories of growing up in rural southwest Georgia. Several works in the exhibition, “Winfred Rembert: Amazing Grace,” with figures carved and tooled into sheets of leather and then painted or dyed, recount his upbringing by Mama, the great-aunt who took over his care after his mother gave him up as an infant. In “The Beginning” (2002), the infant Winfred is handed over to Mama, and “What’s Wrong With Little Winfred” (2002) shows him being held as a baby on the edge of a cotton field. “Saved and Saintified” (2005) and “Leaning on the Everlasting Arms” (2008) show parishioners engaged in ecstatic worship, and one work commemorates Mr. Rembert’s baptism at the age of 9. There are images of “The Dirty Spoon” (2005), the juke joint where Mr. Rembert got his ideas for fashion, and of Homer Clyde’s cafe, an establishment with a “Colored Only” sign posted outside and text describing how Mr. Clyde fed even those who couldn’t pay (although he wouldn’t let you shoot pool free). Another work celebrates “Mary Douglas” (2005), better known as Miss Mary, one of the best midwives in Cuthbert, Ga. As Mr. Rembert recalls in accompanying wall text, she wore her uniform and carried her medical bag “even when she had to spend her last days at the convalescent home.” Mr. Rembert’s story is really shaped, however, by poverty and the effects of racism — which is to say, violence. He started picking cotton at age 6, and the experience of that hard labor, which extended into adulthood, is engrained in his being, as well as in his pictures, which include fields of endless white dots. “Curved cotton rows make a beautiful pattern,” Mr. Rembert says in the catalog. “But as soon as you start picking, you forget how good it looks and think how hard it is.” Wall texts offer detailed accounts of how workers were paid — even how they had to pay to rent straw hats from the commissary to protect themselves from the scorching summer sun — and how labor, tied to the post-slavery sharecropping system, was stratified by discriminatory racial distinctions. These practices permeated everyday life, of course. “Hamilton Avenue” (1999) comes with a description of how the only two whites in the Cuthbert area were the two policemen who parked in the middle of the street, “watching us.” Mr. Rembert’s life became more difficult in the 1960s, when he joined the civil rights movement. A room in the exhibition entered through a glass door comes with a warning at its entrance that the material there is disturbing. Here, we learn about Mr. Rembert’s arrest after a protest and a jailhouse beating that led to his escape, which involved stealing a car and his nearly being lynched (and castrated). After that, he was sentenced to a chain gang, where he worked — picking cotton again — for seven years. (An essay in the catalog describes how blacks were disproportionately represented in chain gangs because of the heavy sentences they received for misdemeanors.) Text accompanying “Almost Me” (1997), which depicts a black man hanged by the neck from a tree branch, is a heartbreaking account of the post-traumatic-stress effects of Mr. Rembert’s own near-lynching: “I never stopped thinking about it and having nightmares about it almost every night. Lots of times I’d get up out of the bed with Patsy and go in the bathroom and just sit there and cry.” (Patsy Gammage married Mr. Rembert five years after he was released from prison; they have eight children.) Beyond his own story, Mr. Rembert has also made some works that offer an amazingly cunning commentary on African-American life. “Michael Jordan Cemetery” (1998) pays homage to the basketball star, but at the same time critiques the expensive basketball shoes made by Nike that “cause problems for black kids.” The composition includes tombstones with the names of young people who have died in altercations over the basketball shoes, and an amazing depiction of a young man, recently shot, bleeding Nike insignia. There is usually little overlap between the art you see in museums and art in which the therapeutic benefits of its making are key. But you can almost feel the way that carving leather pictures has healed Mr. Rembert, in such a way that more recent works are celebrations of pattern and color — and blackness liberated. “The Struggle” (2010) is a clever work in which famous African-Americans are depicted in a field picking cotton, but also doing what they are known best for doing: Michael Jackson is singing and picking cotton; Mr. Jordan is playing basketball and picking cotton; Louis Armstrong has his trumpet; Oprah Winfrey is next to Sojourner Truth, and President Obama, in overalls, is picking cotton right below Michelle Obama. The largest figure in the painting is Malcolm X, and he, too, is picking cotton. The compositions of Mr. Rembert’s recent works, with their white dots and figures lined up in pattern formation along dark strips representing rows of soil, look like African textiles. “Amazing Grace” (2008) includes a musical staff with the score for the famous spiritual, which Mr. Rembert remembers hearing in the cotton fields. “I just loved to listen to the singing,” he remarks, since “singing was the only thing about the fields that I loved.” Mr. Rembert’s work is important because it offers an unvarnished view of the segregated South, from the vantage of a lived history. What makes it resonate, however, is Mr. Rembert’s incredible spirit — what one writer in the catalog calls his “grace.” You feel it throughout these works, which refuse to shrink from the horrors, but especially in that comment about singing: Even in the dreaded cotton fields, Mr. Rembert could find something to love.",

    "source": "Irish Bishops Quit in Wake of an Inquiry <eos> DUBLIN (AP) — Two more Roman Catholic bishops in Ireland have resigned in the wake of a damning investigation into decades of church cover-up of child abuse in the Dublin Archdiocese. The bishops, Eamonn Walsh and Ray Field, offered an apology to child-abuse victims as they announced their resignations during Christmas Mass on Friday. Priests read the statement to worshipers throughout the archdiocese, home to a quarter of Ireland’s 4 million Catholics. Two other bishops, Donal Murray of Limerick and Jim Moriarty of Kildare, stepped down earlier following the publication on Nov. 26 of a report on a three-year investigation into why many abusive Dublin priests escaped justice for so long. The government-ordered investigation found that church leaders in Dublin had spent decades shielding more than 170 pedophile priests from the law. They began providing information to the police in 1995, but they continued to keep secret, until 2004, many files and other records of reported abuse. In their joint statement, Bishops Walsh and Field said they hoped their resignations “may help to bring the peace and reconciliation of Jesus Christ to the victims” of child sexual abuse. “We again apologize to them,” the bishops said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have so bravely spoken out and those who continue to suffer in silence.” The Dublin Archdiocese has faced an increasing number of civil lawsuits from abuse victims, starting in the mid-1990s. The suits were filed after an abuse victim, a former altar boy named Andrew Madden, went public with the church’s effort to buy his silence. The archdiocese estimates that its ultimate bill for settlements and legal costs could exceed $30 million. A fifth bishop named in the investigative report, Martin Drennan of Galway, has said that he did not endanger children and will not resign, a position initially taken by the four bishops who have now stepped down. “Martin Drennan will have to resign,” Mr. Madden said. “We want full accountability.” He criticized the bishops’ initial position, which he said was that “as a group they were very apologetic, but individually they had done nothing wrong.” Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, who was put in charge of the Dublin Archdiocese in 2004 with a mandate to confront the abuse scandal, welcomed the resignations. Archbishop Martin said in an interview that the church “must ensure that the management of the past is entrusted to a new generation of people who think differently.” In his Christmas sermon, Archbishop Martin said the church for too long had placed its self-interest above the rights of its parishioners, particularly innocent children. “It has been a painful year,” he told worshipers. “But the church today may well be a better and safer place than was the church of 25 years ago — when all looked well, but where deep shadows were kept buried.”",

    "source": "Review: Rolling Out the Welcome Mat at Mishmish Restaurant in Montclair <eos> Within minutes of sitting down at Mishmish , the new Mediterranean restaurant in Montclair, we were welcomed with a large plate of homemade vegetable pickles, warm focaccia and a dish of olive oil. Mishmish feels like one of those neighborhood trattorias you stumble into while on vacation. You have been walking around all day, are ravenous and are pondering divorce from your traveling partner because the two of you just cannot decide where to eat. Then you discover a little gem, and end up eating all your meals there. In fact, I have eaten at Mishmish five times since I discovered it a few months ago. Mishmish is the Hebrew and Arabic word for apricot. For Meny Vaknin, the owner and chef, it is also a symbol of the hospitality he saw growing up in the Negev Desert town of Yeruham, Israel. When guests were expected, his mother would fill a special glass dish, the kind with many small compartments, with dried apricots and other treats. It was important for his restaurant to have similar welcoming gestures, Mr. Vaknin said in an interview after my visits. “The restaurant is my house, literally and poetically,” he said. “I’m there all day, and I want guests to feel like they are coming into my kitchen.” My guests and I certainly made ourselves at home, and ordered with abandon. We could easily have had a satisfying feast eating solely appetizers. Portions were generous, as though your grandma was in the kitchen and had noticed you were getting a little thin. The hummus was creamy with tahini and olive oil, a reminder that grocery-store hummus is to homemade hummus as a chocolate Snack Pack pudding is to chocolate mousse. A radicchio fattoush salad was not fattoush-y at all, with nary a piece of bread in sight, but it did offer a bright blend of radicchio, watercress, blood orange slices and pecans, with a layer of labne, the Middle Eastern strained yogurt, a tangy contrast. Octopus, perfectly cooked each time we had it, was tender, with a good crunch thanks to a brief sojourn on the grill. It was served with a fennel purée, chickpeas, blood orange slices and almonds. Image Radicchio fattoush with watercress, blood orange slices, pecans and labne; left, grilled striped bass with oven-dried tomato olive sauce. Credit Nancy Wegard for The New York Times A few dishes were inconsistent. We were disappointed on one visit to find the fried cauliflower appetizer we had previously enjoyed to be undercooked. Another night, we received a nearly raw lamb kebab. Our waitress seemed quietly appalled and quickly whisked it away. But then a dish like the striped bass would arrive. It was a textbook-perfect piece of pan-seared fish, with crisp skin and delicate flesh. The bass, served over celeriac purée along with a lusty combination of oven-dried tomatoes and Kalamata olives, reminded me of my summers in Cap Ferrat on the French Riviera, where we drank the Champagne so quickly it never had time to warm up in the hot Mediterranean sun. (O.K., that last part was fantasy, but the fish was very good.) Mussels were served in a tomato sauce rich with the flavors of garlic, fennel and onion, and made fiery with the addition of homemade harissa and dried chiles. Tomato sauces feature prominently in a number of the dishes, like the lunchtime shakshouka with eggs, and also in a riff on the traditional preparation for fish that Mr. Vaknin said was found simmering on stoves every Friday night in Moroccan-Jewish households. And the herbaceous, garlicky sauce with chickpeas is made à la minute, so it is fresher tasting and the fish — a grouper in this case — is still tender. Mr. Vaknin’s skills as a chef, honed in highly regarded New York City restaurants like Boulud Sud and East Wick , also come through in traditional bistro dishes like hanger steak and an exemplary roast chicken. I recently bought sandwiches at Mishmish for an impromptu picnic. The sabich sandwich (say that 10 times fast) is as famous in Israel as falafel. Typically made with fried eggplant, here smoked eggplant spread was slathered on a roll and topped with six-minute boiled eggs, feta cheese and sweet oven-roasted tomatoes. The sabich made me feel virtuous and luxurious at the same time, and went to the top of my list of favorite sandwiches. Until I tried the shawarma. It was unlike most shawarma you find around these parts. At Mishmish, little pieces of marinated grilled chicken thigh, a generous portion of tahini and some nice-looking greens were packed onto a crusty long roll — not the expected pita — and that, it turned out, is where they should have been all along. It was juicy to the last garlicky morsel. Lunch or dinner, Mr. Vaknin is single-minded in his quest to ensure you leave full. If you still have room for dessert, an interesting choice might be the kunefe, a puck of shredded phyllo dough filled with sweetened goat cheese, which is then — gasp — fried and soaked in syrup. If you do not have room, do as I did, and just go back for more tomorrow.",

    "source": "Crisis Puts Tax Moves Into Play <eos> WASHINGTON — A long-stalled tax bill offering incentives for the use of renewable energy and providing tax breaks to millions of families and businesses gained momentum on Wednesday, when it was strapped onto emergency legislation to shore up the nation’s financial system. By a vote of 74 to 25, the Senate passed the legislation, including the tax breaks, on Wednesday night. The tax provisions may make the bill more attractive to some Republicans in the House, which rejected a bailout bill in a stunning vote on Monday. The Senate version of the bailout package was amended, at the last minute, to include a wide range of tax breaks, as well as financial aid for certain rural schools and a measure requiring health insurance companies to provide more generous coverage to many people with mental illnesses. The latest version, virtually identical to that passed overwhelmingly by the Senate on Sept. 23, would extend the business tax credit for research and development, expand the child tax credit and protect millions of middle-income families from the alternative minimum tax , originally aimed at high-income families. It would also provide tax relief to victims of recent natural disasters, including floods, tornadoes and severe storms. The tax credits for investing in solar energy and producing wind energy are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Gregory S. Wetstone, director of government affairs at the American Wind Energy Association, hailed the efforts in Congress. “The renewable energy tax credits are critically important to the future of wind and solar energy in America,” Mr. Wetstone said. “In 2000, 2002 and 2004,” he continued, “the industry suffered a drop of 70 percent to 90 percent in the level of annual new wind power as a result of Congress’s failure to extend the tax credit, which is currently the only major federal program to support renewable energy.” Many House Democrats, led by the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, had insisted that the cost of tax breaks be fully offset by revenue increases or spending cuts. But it appeared that they were going to lose their yearlong fight with the Senate over this question. Taken as a whole, the Senate tax package would cost $150.5 billion over 10 years. Of that amount, about $43.5 billion would be offset. The Senate bill includes several revenue-raising provisions. It would, for example, keep hedge fund managers from using offshore corporations to defer taxes on compensation for their investment services. It would also freeze a tax deduction that oil and gas companies get for certain domestic production activities. The deduction, now 6 percent, is scheduled to rise to 9 percent in 2010. “With oil and gas prices on the rise, the oil and gas industry does not need tax incentives that it may have needed in the past,” said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the chairman of the Finance Committee. Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the Senate was setting a bad precedent by trying to impose its tax legislation on the House, rather than negotiating a compromise. “The Senate leadership took an unprecedented gamble when they attached a package of tax extenders to the emergency financial rescue legislation,” Mr. Rangel said. He complained that Senate Democrats “repeatedly capitulate to demands” by Republican senators, many of whom contend that Congress should not have to pay for the extension of expiring tax breaks. To increase tax compliance, the bill would require brokerage firms to track and report the cost basis of stocks, bonds and other securities sold during the year. The cost basis is used in computing the capital gains on which investors must pay taxes. When people overstate the original value or purchase price of stock, they may pay less tax than they should. Congress estimates that the proposed reporting requirement would raise $6.7 billion in additional revenue over 10 years. The House jealously guards its power to originate tax bills. The Constitution says, “All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.” The Senate version of the bailout package is technically an amendment to a House bill that would require group health insurance plans to provide equivalence, or parity, in the coverage of mental and physical illnesses. Insurers often charge higher co-payments and set stricter limits for mental health care than for the treatment of physical illnesses. The bill would outlaw such discrimination, and the government could impose an excise tax on health plans that violated the new requirement. On the tax legislation, as on other issues in the last two years, the Senate appears likely to get its way because major bills typically need 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles in the Senate. In practice, this means that the majority Democrats cannot pass contentious bills without help from some Republicans. Another sweetener added to the bailout bill would extend the “secure rural schools” program, which compensates counties for the loss of revenues they had been receiving from the sale of timber on federal lands. Counties in Oregon and several other states have laid off police officers and cut back public services since authority for the program, which provides money for schools and roads, expired this year.",

    "source": "A Year That Shattered the Illusion of Cricket’s Safety <eos> Cricket had little innocence left to lose on March 3, 2009. Images of rural arcadia conceal the reality of long histories of corruption, commercialism and violence. Yet that morning in Lahore, when terrorists attacked the bus carrying the Sri Lankan team to the Gaddafi Stadium for the third day of a test against Pakistan, still shattered an illusion — the belief that cricket’s popularity in South Asia protected it from terrorism. None of the cricketers was seriously injured, but six policemen and two civilians, including the driver of the minivan carrying the umpires, were killed. The attack underlined a much unhappier truth, that the prominence of the game and importance of teams as national symbols might make them targets. It sentenced Pakistan to a fresh period of purdah as an international venue. It was somehow characteristic that its players responded with a vibrant, moving, ever-more-irresistible campaign to take the year’s main prize — the World Twenty20 – within a couple of months, and still more typical that Younis Khan, whose inspiring captaincy played such a part in that triumph, should have been forced from office before the end of the year. When cricket administrators were not worrying about security they were preoccupied by fears that the Twenty20 format, still an infant, might strangle other forms of the game. Those concerns merged when the lucratively glitzy Indian Premier League was forced offshore to South Africa for its second season because of security fears because it would have coincided with an Indian election. The I.P.L. survived the experience. With the demise of the rival Indian Cricket League and the U.S. indictment for fraud of financier Allen Stanford, who was funding a competition in the West Indies, it now has no real rival. If the five-day test format is under threat, it is not going without a considerable fight. The last week alone has seen two matches — Australia’s narrow defeat of the much-improved West Indies at Perth and England’s desperate and ultimately successful battle for a draw against South Africa at Centurion — among a number this year that epitomized the unmatched capacity of the five-day game to generate multiple shifts in mood and fortune, along with a sustained ratcheting up of tension. England’s resistance, literally down to the last man, precisely echoed its effort earlier in the year at Cardiff, opening act of an Ashes contest with Australia that underlined the parallel virtues of still more threatened species, the five-test series. Australia produced arguably the test performance of 2009, winning in South Africa to take immediate revenge for a series it had lost at home to the Proteas. It won the year’s second international prize, the Champions Trophy. Yet defeat in the Ashes ended its long leadership of the world rankings. It gave way to South Africa, which was deposed in turn by India in early December. That succession reflected a year in which the prizes were shared out. A reasonable case can be made that the Players of the Year were the Sri Lankan batsman Tillekeratne Dilshan, who scored six centuries in five-day tests and wowed the World Twenty20 with flamboyant strokeplay that included a revolutionary over-the-shoulder scoop; Shakib-al-Hasan, whose status as Bangladesh’s first truly world-class player was underlined by ranking as the leading all-rounder in one-day internationals; and New Zealand’s phenomenal, Atlas-like captain Daniel Vettori. If a batting average of nearly 60 from the lower order was his greatest achievement, Vettori was also part of a significant revival in finger spin, supposedly no longer a threat at test level. Vettori, Shakib, South Africa’s Paul Harris, England’s Graeme Swann, Australia’s Nathan Hauritz, Sri Lanka’s Rangana Herath and the vast West Indian Sulieman Benn all did better than is expected of the breed. Benn also helped raise hopes of a still more welcome revival — by the West Indies. That team may have reached rock bottom when a contract dispute led to a replacement team playing, and losing, at home to Bangladesh. Yet Trinidad and Tobago’s vividly exuberant contribution to the Champions League, a new tournament for regional and national champions won by New South Wales, was followed by the spirited West Indies performance in Australia. Outside the test nations, the outstanding story was Afghanistan’s rise through four divisions of the minor nations before it narrowly missed qualification for the 2011 World Cup. It will be no surprise if it goes one better in the new year and claims a place in the next World Twenty20. If the prizes in the men’s game were shared out, those for women were concentrated. England won both the World Cup, played in Australia, and the World Twenty20 as well as retaining the Ashes. Claire Taylor became the first woman named as one of Wisden Cricket Almanack’s five cricketers of the year. If that was a happy arrival, regrettable departures included veteran scorer and statistician Bill Frindall and much-loved umpire David Shepherd, who both died during the year.",

    "source": "Readers’ Questions Answered <eos> Church Holdings Q. I was told that Trinity Church in the financial district literally owns Wall Street — specifically, the land underneath the New York Stock Exchange. True? A. False. “Trinity Church does not and has never owned Wall Street or the land that the Stock Exchange sits on,” Diane Reed, a spokeswoman for the church, said in an e-mail message. Trinity, an Episcopal church on Broadway at the west end of Wall Street, was founded in 1696 (with help from Captain Kidd, among others). It built separate chapels and paid for its charity work, in part, through an enormous land grant from Queen Anne. At one time, its holdings stretched from Fulton to Christopher Street and from Broadway west to the Hudson River. But not Wall Street. The familiar New York Stock Exchange Building, right, as well as the ground beneath it, are owned by NYSE Euronext, the company that runs the exchange. The exchange building was built in 1901-3 by George B. Post and was designated a city landmark in 1985. Deadheads of Old Q. I was reading a century-old article about a musical debut in New York that said the audience included “deadheads.” Since Jerry Garcia’s father had probably not even been born yet, what does that mean? A. Today, of course, that fine old noun usually means an ardent fan of the Grateful Dead. But a century ago, it had several other meanings, most of them related to freeloading, said Jesse Sheidlower, North American editor at large for the Oxford English Dictionary, said in an e-mail message. Some of these senses include “a person admitted free to a theater, sporting event, etc.” Others are broader, like “sponger; deadbeat” and “a dull, lazy or boring person.” The term was used in the theater to describe the management practice, especially in the case of a debut recital or a play’s opening night, of giving away unsold tickets to pack the house, presenting a better image for critics. A long entry on “deadhead” in the Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang traces its first use to 1841. In “The Gilded Age” (1874), Mark Twain and C. D. Warner wrote that congressmen “always traveled ‘dead-head’ both ways.” Student Records Redux A letter about “An Old Bugaboo,” an F.Y.I. item on Feb. 28 about New York State’s requirements on the retention of student records:  New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn is the first school in New York City to digitize and microfilm its student records after meeting state requirements. This has become a necessary process, as older records cannot just be tossed out, and space in schools is a vital issue. We were granted approval for our program from legal counsel at the city’s Department of Education, and financial support from the New York State Archives’ Local Government Records Management Improvement Fund. However, the New Utrecht High School budget provided a majority of the funds required. Student records, particularly high school records, are necessary to help former students to return to school later in life, to apply for government and corporate jobs, for Social Security , in making security checks and to meet eligibility requirements for numerous other reasons. The student records issue will only become more tangled in years to come unless funding is found to secure them by microfilm and digitization.

    "source": "Trying to Save by Increasing Doctors' Fees <eos> Cutting health costs by paying doctors more? That is the premise of experiments under way by federal and state government agencies and many insurers around the country. The idea is that by paying family physicians, internists and pediatricians to devote more time and attention to their patients, insurers and patients can save thousands of dollars downstream on unnecessary tests, visits to expensive specialists and avoidable trips to the hospital. Nationally, Medicare and commercial insurers pay an average of only about $60 a visit to the office of a primary-care doctor and rarely if ever pay for telephone or e-mail consultations. Many health policy experts say the payments are not enough to let the doctors spend more than a few minutes with each patient. Robert Williamson, a 60-year-old Philadelphia man, recalls the cursory exam he received a few years ago from a harried doctor who, Mr. Williamson says, missed the danger signals and sent him home. A short time later Mr. Williamson had a stroke. For want of a careful examination by a primary-care doctor, Mr. Williamson became one of countless Americans each year whose unidentified or under-treated illnesses escalate into medical conditions with catastrophic personal and economic costs. Besides incurring $30,000 in hospital bills paid by his employer’s insurer, Mr. Williamson had to stop working as a customer service representative at Philadelphia Gas Works and go on Social Security disability, at a current cost to taxpayers of $1,900 a month. With Mr. Williamson’s new doctor, such an outcome would be much less likely. “I give him my heart and diabetes readings by e-mail and phone, without getting up out of my chair,” Mr. Williamson said. “I can get better directions, at the very moment I need them. It’s life-saving.” His current internist, Richard Baron, is one of more than 100 physicians in metropolitan Philadelphia taking part in the experiment, which is being conducted jointly by some of the region’s largest insurers. Dr. Baron still gets a fee of only about $64 for each office visit. But his five-doctor group will also receive $200,000 to $300,000 this year beyond their regular fees to keep better track of their 8,400 patients. “We are trying to do more e-mail care and telephone care, which we haven’t been paid for in the past,” Dr. Baron said. Insurers are conducting similar pilot projects in at least a half-dozen states, in experiments involving thousands of doctors and nearly 2 million patients. Many more are in the planning stages, at the urging of health policy experts and employers that provide medical benefits. The big government health care programs, Medicaid and Medicare, are also studying the concept. A Medicaid experiment already under way in North Carolina saved the government program in that state about $162 million in 2006. That was 11 percent less than the state would have spent under the old system of reimbursement, according to an audit by Mercer, a consulting firm. Earlier this month, as part of a bill to protect Medicare payments to doctors, the Senate overrode President Bush’s veto to authorize $100 million to finance a three-year Medicare pilot to further test the concept of spending more on primary care. Under the various payment experiments, family doctors are encouraged to hire additional staff to help monitor patients’ treatment and follow-up, and to help patients stay ahead of problems by sending reminders when they are due for preventive tests like mammograms and colon exams. For people like Mr. Williamson with serious chronic illnesses, the doctors take personal charge, answering patients’ phone or e-mail questions promptly. In emergencies, patients can show up at the office and see their doctors on short notice. Such features add up to a model of primary care that proponents refer to as providing people with a “medical home” — a base where doctors, staff and patients pull together as one big health-care family. Or at least that is the ideal. “It’s the latest new, new thing — testing whether medical homes can be a vehicle for pulling America upwards from the grossly inefficient swamp in which our health system is currently mired,” said Dr. Arnold Milstein, a senior consultant at Mercer who is also member of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent Congressional agency. The panel has recommended that Medicare expand its plans for a medical-home pilot project next year that is expected to pay primary-care doctors in eight states $30 to $40 a month extra for each person enrolled with a chronic illness. In Michigan, the auto industry has been a major force behind one of the largest medical-home projects yet devised. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which has 4.7 million members, plans to spend $30 million this year to help primary-care doctors offer such services. About 4,900 primary-care doctors are participating, said Dr. Thomas Simmer, chief medical officer of Michigan Blue Cross. Advocates of the approach hope it will attract more doctors to primary care. Last year only 7 percent of medical school graduates chose family practice, a field with a median income of $150,000, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. That compares with $406,000 for gastroenterologists and $433,00 for cardiac surgeons, as measured by the Medical Group Management Association. The American Medical Association said that in its latest count, in 2006, there were slightly more than 251,000 practicing family physicians, general, practitioners, and internists in this country, compared with nearly 472,000 specialists. “The pipeline of primary-care doctors has been running dry for several years,” said Dr. Barbara Starfield, a health policy expert at Johns Hopkins University. Many parts of the country do not meet the generally accepted standard of one primary-care doctor for every 1,000 to 2,000 people, Dr. Starfield said. The Philadelphia pilot project is sponsored by three of the area’s largest insurers — Independence Blue Cross, Aetna and Cigna — as well as some local providers of Medicaid services, which together have agreed to spend $13 million on the program over the next three years. Dr. Baron expects the project to add as much 15 percent to the annual revenue of his medical group. He declined to specify the practice’s total gross income last year, but said that each of the five physicians earned less than the $177,000 national median for internists. To participate in the Philadelphia experiment, doctors must arrange for their offices to keep in close communication with their entire rosters of patients. Dr. Baron’s practice, besides the physicians, a business manager and clerical assistants, has added a patient educator, whom he said would cost $60,000 in salary plus $60,000 more for benefits and supporting technology. The group is also spending $25,000 for part-time services of a data analyst. Employers predict that better early care will reduce their health costs in the long run. “We want to buy our care this way, we think it’s the right thing to do,” said Dr. Paul Grundy, I.B.M.’s director of health care technology and strategic initiatives. Despite the hopes riding on the pilot projects, some experts are skeptical. “There is very little concrete rigorous evidence that the medical home will do all those wonderful things they want it to do,” said Mark Pauly, a health policy economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Even executives at Aetna and Cigna are cautious about betting on a payoff from the Philadelphia project, which was orchestrated by Pennsylvania’s Democratic Governor Edward G. Rendell and his office of health care reform. It is uncertain whether there will be a direct return on the investment within a “reasonable time horizon,” said Dr. Don Liss, an Aetna medical director who is an internist himself. Still, Dr. Liss added, “a reasonable body of evidence suggests that improving primary care as a foundation for health care will improve quality and access to care.” The Pennsylvania program will start expanding to other parts of the state this fall. It comes none too soon, in the view of Dr. Joseph Mambu, a family physician in Lower Gwynedd, a Philadelphia suburb. Trying to build a medical-home practice before the pilot project began, Dr. Mambu said he went into debt installing an electronic medical records system and establishing patient-friendly features like evening and Saturday office hours. “Last year, I hit the red ink because of all the technology,” he said. “Unless we get help from the insurance companies and the government, the system is going down the toilet.” But with the new medical-home money, Dr. Mambu said he expected to pay down his debts and start a patient wellness program. The insurance pilot project, he said, offers “a ray of hope.”",

The temperature is in the low 80s and the seawater is nearly as warm. It must be a nice place to give a sermon. But for Katharine Jefferts Schori , since 2006 the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States, memories of Curaçao will always be associated with the controversy that greeted her upon her return — another controversy in what has already been a rocky tenure as the head of a troubled, shrinking church. On May 12, Bishop Jefferts Schori preached in All Saints Church in the town of Steenrijk. Curaçao is part of the Episcopal Church’s small Diocese of Venezuela , and Bishop Jefferts Schori was making a pastoral call to a distant congregation. Her text was Acts 16:16-34 , which includes the story of a slave woman and fortuneteller whom Paul encounters in Philippi, Macedonia. As Luke, who Christians believe is the narrator, tells the story, the woman “had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great deal of money by fortunetelling. While she followed Paul and us, she would cry out, ‘These men are slaves of the Most High God, who proclaim to you a way of salvation.’ ” After many days, “Paul, very much annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, ‘I order you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.’ And it came out that very hour.” This story has historically been read as a tale of exorcism, in which Paul delivers the woman from some sort of indwelling spirit — or, alternatively, strikes a blow for monotheism against local beliefs in plural gods. But as Bishop Jefferts Schori interpreted the passage, Paul was guilty of failing to value diversity, to see the slave girl’s beautiful “difference.” “Paul is annoyed at the slave girl,” Bishop Jefferts Schori preached . “She’s telling the same truth Paul and others claim for themselves. But Paul is annoyed, perhaps for being put in his place, and he responds by depriving her of her gift of spiritual awareness. Paul can’t abide something he won’t see as beautiful or holy, so he tries to destroy it.” Within a week, angry Episcopalians — yes, that could be an Updike title — took to the Web with outrage. Articles in Anglican Ink, The Christian Post, and other conservative publications questioned the presiding bishop’s exegetical acumen, even her standing as a Christian. Disdain for Bishop Jefferts Schori is common among church conservatives. She is supportive of marriage and ordination for gay men and lesbians, and she has taken a very hard line against dissenting dioceses, many of whose members hold more traditional views. Under her leadership, the Episcopal Church has spent millions of dollars in legal fights to keep the church buildings of congregations whose members have voted to leave the Episcopal Church, often to affiliate with more traditionalist organizations. Image Katharine Jefferts Schori Credit Haraz N. Ghanbari/Associated Press No presiding bishop could be truly popular right now. Bishop Jefferts Schori assumed her post at a time when, on issues of sexuality and theology, it would be impossible not to make enemies in the church. That said, her rereading of Paul’s actions toward the slave girl are indeed provocative. “Bishop Jefferts Schori simply ignores what the text says, in order to give a reading that portrays Paul as a patriarchal oppressor who fails to recognize the voice of God in a low-status young girl,” said Jordan Hylden, who writes for Christian publications and will soon be ordained an Episcopal priest. The bishop’s interpretation is “so obviously wrong,” Mr. Hylden continued, in an e-mail, “that the deeper question is: Why does she feel at liberty to give a reading of Scripture that doesn’t even try to understand and explain what the text is saying?” Fidelity to the Bible text is obviously never trivial for Christians, but it is especially sensitive for Episcopalians right now. Conservatives believe that the church leadership, which now consecrates gay and lesbian bishops and permits its priests to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies, ignores biblical teachings about sexuality, in both the Old and New Testaments. Although a spokesman for the Episcopal Church said the exact number of members who have departed during Bishop Jefferts Schori’s tenure is not available, to take one example, the Anglican Church in North America, which was founded in 2009 and claims to have 1,000 congregations representing 100,000 worshipers, includes many ex-Episcopalians. Their departure has a lot to do with disagreements over how one reads the Bible. Mikeal C. Parsons, a Baylor University professor and author of a book about Acts, wrote in an e-mail that Bishop Jefferts Schori’s critics are probably right that “she interprets the text in a direction” that the original author would not recognize. “That is to say,” Dr. Parsons wrote, “I do not think the author of Acts is criticizing Paul’s actions in any way, certainly not for failing to recognize her ‘gift of spiritual awareness.’ ” On the other hand, Dr. Parsons continued, “there is nothing in the text to suggest” that the spirit in the woman was “evil.” The story is not necessarily about an “exorcism” of demonic powers. Rather, after driving the spirit out, Paul is thrown in prison, because “her owners are incensed that their financial exploitation of the girl’s divining powers have ended” — they can no longer profit from her fortunetelling. In that sense, Paul is definitely her liberator, in a literal as well as spiritual sense. But Bishop Jefferts Schori pointed out, in an interview on Friday, that elsewhere in the Bible, Paul appears to condone slavery. Her sermon was thus part of a necessary, continuing tradition of interpretation. “If the church had never reinterpreted Scripture,” the bishop said, “we would still have slavery — legal slavery.” Scripture must be read “in our own time and our own context,” because prior generations had “a limited view,” she said. “They had to have a limited view, because none of us is God.”",

    "source": "Taking the Gender Fight Worldwide <eos> PARIS — “I am a woman, a Socialist, divorced and agnostic,” the new defense minister told the generals of her Roman Catholic country. “But we will work together very well.” Michelle Bachelet , who in 2002 became Chile ’s first female defense minister and four years later the country’s first female president, has never shied from challenging the status quo. Now the first head of U.N. Women, the three-month-old U.N. agency for gender equality and female empowerment, Ms. Bachelet is doing it again — this time turning some traditional notions of feminism on their head. “We need men. We need to obtain big important male champions,” Ms. Bachelet, a 59-year-old daughter of a general and single mother of three, said brightly during a recent interview in Paris. She hired a man as one of her two deputies — “that wasn’t by chance, I wanted gender equality” — and courts male chief executives to sign up to seven principles for female empowerment. A new three-year gender awareness program for peace negotiators focuses as much on training male mediators about rape in conflict zones as on grooming future female mediators. U.N. Women is the first high-profile international agency dedicated to gender, turning a long-held ambition of feminist activists across the world into a reality. First floated as a serious proposal in 2006, it took four years of heavy lobbying from the four U.N. units previously dealing with gender advocacy and dogged support from big hitters like Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton before the body went to work in January. With a $500 million annual budget and some 405 full-time staff members, it is dwarfed by other outfits — Unicef, the agency for children, or the U.N. Development Program each count around 6,000 staff members and budgets of $1.25 billion. So the woman at the helm of this new agency matters all the more. While few dispute her star power and track record on advancing women’s rights in Chile, Ms. Bachelet’s conviction that men are indispensable to the next stage of women’s liberation is not universally shared. Nor was everyone happy with her appointment. Some African women’s organizations grumbled that a woman from a poorer country should have been chosen. Others lament that she is not focusing enough on issues like genital mutilation, H.I.V. and AIDS or maternal mortality, the most neglected of the Millennium Development Goals. “African women have been a little bit forgotten,” said Fatoumata Siré Diakité, the Malian ambassador to Germany who last week listened to a video message by Ms. Bachelet presented to a women’s conference in Germany. “She was very focused on Europe and America. She didn’t mention Africa at all. But women in Africa and Asia are the majority of women in the world.” Sure enough, as Ms. Bachelet sat in the salon of the Hotel Lutetia on Paris’s Left Bank, her list of priorities contained no explicit mention of the M.D.G.’s, as they are known in these circles. Instead, Ms. Bachelet spent nearly half an hour talking about getting more women into politics, into business and into military and peacekeeping roles — if need be with affirmative action. Her main message? Focus on female empowerment, not female victimhood. “Of course at U.N. Women we are concerned with women in precarious living conditions,” she said, stressing that violence against women was one of her top concerns. “But women will never achieve equal rights if they are not empowered.” “What we know is that empowerment does not just happen accidentally, or from one generation to another,” she went on to say. “We need some form of affirmative action.” In the developed world, she said, the fashionable debate about boardroom quotas is important, but “we need to go further.” In sub-Saharan Africa, meanwhile, she talks about changing inheritance laws that mean women hold only 2 percent of the land rights even though they cultivate 85 percent of the land itself. She notes that of 300-plus peace agreements signed since the Cold War ended, only 18 mention women and only 8 mention sexual violence. She is lobbying governments across the world to pay more attention to women — and put more money into U.N. Women’s coffers. “Having been a head of state gives you the possibility of getting into places others can’t go,” she said. This week she is in Latin America. Last week she met French government ministers and top E.U. officials. Before that, she urged the interim leadership in Cairo to give women a real say in post-revolution Egypt and met a number of African leaders in Ethiopia. In the Paris interview, indignation rose in her voice as she noted that only 28 countries have achieved the target set at the 1995 U.N. women’s conference in Beijing for national parliaments to have at least 30 percent female members. Of those 28, she points out, only 5 have managed without a quota law. A sigh. Then the determined smile came back. “We need a change in mind-set, a cultural change,” she said. In her own country, she changed the mind-set for good: After being nicknamed “fatty” in her early months as president, she finished her four-year (nonrenewable) term with record approval ratings of 84 percent. As health minister, this pediatrician-turned-military strategist reformed Chile’s primary care system for families. As defense minister, she improved access for women to the military and the police force. And as president she appointed a cabinet that was half female, tripled the number of free childcare places for low-income mothers and pushed through a pension overhaul that pays women a bonus for each child. She is convinced that without her stint as defense minister, surveying flood damage in the Chilean capital perched from an open tank for example, she would never have become president. “Health minister alone wouldn’t have done it — health is a service, it’s too female,” she said. Breaking the mold is her speciality. Involved in left-wing politics since studying medicine in the 1970s, she also was top of her class in a prestigious defense strategy program two decades later. A survivor of torture and exile under the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship that killed her father, she is seen at once as tough and maternal. “She was our anti-Thatcher, not adopting all the male-dominated codes of power but transforming them,” wrote Paula Escobar Chavarría, magazines editor of the Chilean daily El Mercurio. “In this small land at the bottom of the world’s maps, little girls now want to be president and no one wonders if it’s possible.” Changing a country when you are its head of state is one thing. Whether Ms. Bachelet can galvanize many countries, or indeed the world, to alter attitudes toward women from the pulpit of a new U.N. agency remains to be seen.",

    "source": "Arbitrator’s Ruling Banishes the Yankees’ Alex Rodriguez for a Season <eos> Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez was barred for 162 games and the 2014 postseason, the longest suspension for doping in baseball history, after an arbitrator upheld most of the punishment sought by Major League Baseball. The ruling , announced Saturday by Fredric R. Horowitz, baseball’s chief arbitrator, fell short of the initial 211-game suspension. But it raises the possibility that Rodriguez, the highest-paid player in the sport, will never play another game, particularly because he has been hobbled by injuries. The suspension amounts to a significant victory for Bud Selig, baseball’s longtime commissioner, who in recent years has tried to redefine himself as a chief executive determined to crack down on the use of performance-enhancing drugs in the sport. With Selig planning to retire after the 2014 season, his legacy will now include an important milestone: a lengthy suspension of Rodriguez, one of the best players of his generation, one of the game’s top home run hitters and someone who for years managed to sidestep baseball’s strong suspicions that he was using banned substances. “For more than five decades, the arbitration process under the basic agreement has been a fair and effective mechanism for resolving disputes and protecting player rights,” Major League Baseball said in a statement, referring to the collective bargaining agreement that dictates the arbitration process. “While we believe the original 211-game suspension was appropriate, we respect the decision.” In a statement through his spokesman, Rodriguez criticized the ruling and vowed to challenge it in court. “The number of games sadly comes as no surprise, as the deck has been stacked against me from Day 1,” Rodriguez said. “This is one man’s decision, that was not put before a fair and impartial jury, does not involve me having failed a single drug test, is at odds with the facts and is inconsistent with the terms of the Joint Drug Agreement and the Basic Agreement, and relies on testimony and documents that would never have been allowed in any court in the United States because they are false and wholly unreliable.” The suspension will cost Rodriguez all of the $25 million the Yankees were obligated to pay him for the 2014 season. But when the suspension ends, Rodriguez will still be owed $61 million through a contract that runs through 2017. Rodriguez will have an incentive to find a way to keep playing. He has had significant hip injuries in recent years and will be 39 when he is eligible to return. If he cannot return, he could opt for a disability retirement that would guarantee his money. Major League Baseball did not make public Horowitz’s written decision, which was given to the parties and presumably includes his rationale for upholding most of the suspension. The players union, which was involved in representing Rodriguez in the arbitration, said it “strongly disagrees” with the decision. The union said in a statement, however, that it recognized “that a final and binding decision has been reached.” Although baseball rules call for 50 game bans for first-time doping offenders, Rodriguez’s suspension was stretched to 211 games because of claims by the league that he had used prohibited substances over a period of years and that he had interfered with the investigation into his conduct. Rodriguez and his team of legal advisers said they would try to appeal Horowitz’s decision in the courts, or at least to delay Saturday’s ruling through an injunction. They could press that effort through a lawsuit they have already filed against both baseball and Selig, a suit that claims that Rodriguez was the target of a “witch hunt.” His advisers could also pursue new litigation. Rodriguez was already suggesting that he would continue his defense. “No player should have to go through what I have been dealing with, and I am exhausting all options to ensure not only that I get justice, but that players’ contracts and rights are protected through the next round of bargaining, and that the M.L.B. investigation and arbitration process cannot be used against others in the future the way it is currently being used to unjustly punish me,” Rodriguez said in his statement. It is unlikely, however, that a judge would give Rodriguez much relief. Legal experts say it is unusual for a judge to second-guess an arbitrator in a labor dispute — especially in a situation like this, in which the process was agreed upon by the employers and the employees’ union. Video The suspension of Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees was reduced from 211 to 162 games. Credit Credit Brian Snyder/Reuters “They may be hoping they get an Alex Rodriguez fan, but even then, I’d be surprised if any state court judge would hear his case,” said Steven G. Eckhaus, an employment law expert with the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. Selig suspended Rodriguez in August, citing his “use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited, performance-enhancing substances” over many years. Rodriguez, who admitted to using performance enhancers more than a decade ago, when playing for the Texas Rangers, has denied using such drugs since. The suspension by Selig came six months after baseball started an investigation into Biogenesis of America, a South Florida anti-aging clinic that is no longer operating. Miami New Times, a weekly newspaper, had reported that it obtained patient records that appeared to connect a number of professional players, including Rodriguez, to the clinic, and that the clinic’s director, Anthony Bosch, was supplying the players with banned performance enhancers. After the article appeared, M.L.B. quickly responded, but as its investigators descended on South Florida to verify the newspaper’s account, they ran into substantial resistance. Witnesses could not be trusted, they said, or sought cash payments. People associated with players targeted in the inquiry appeared to be interfering. And Bosch was denying that he had distributed performance enhancers to Rodriguez or other players. Making little headway, baseball’s lawyers then filed a lawsuit in March asserting that Bosch and other people connected to the clinic had interfered in baseball’s business. Baseball’s investigators also decided to pay for information in the case, including $125,000 for documents from the clinic — a decision that was criticized and would be cited by Rodriguez’s lawyers as an example of inappropriate tactics in the Biogenesis investigation. In June, Bosch, concerned about the lawsuit, agreed to cooperate with baseball, becoming its star witness. That put him on a path to testify against Rodriguez at the arbitration hearing, which ran, with interruptions, through most of October and November and easily outlasted baseball’s postseason. Bosch, who through his spokeswoman said Saturday that he took no joy in seeing Rodriguez punished, also provided information that baseball used in suspending 13 other players tied to Biogenesis. All were suspended for 50 games, except for Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers, who received a 65-game ban. None of those players appealed their penalties. But Rodriguez did appeal. He had spent much of last season rehabilitating his hip after surgery in January 2013, and in an odd bit of timing, he played his first game of the season on the day — Aug. 5 — that Selig suspended him. Rodriguez quickly made it clear that he would fight Selig’s actions, and in the days after the suspension, he bolstered his legal team, adding Joseph Tacopina, a well-known criminal defense lawyer, to represent him in his arbitration proceedings. The arbitration, structured much like a trial, was held at baseball’s headquarters in Manhattan. It took place over about 10 days and served as an unusual counterpoint to a postseason in which the Yankees were not participants for just the second time in nearly two decades. The hearings almost became a spectacle at times, with Rodriguez supporters gathered outside on the sidewalk in what amounted to a boisterous picket line, while inside Bosch testified but Rodriguez did not. As the proceedings went on, the animosity between Rodriguez and Selig appeared to grow. In October, Rodriguez’s lawyers filed their lawsuit against baseball and Selig, contending that both had interfered with Rodriguez’s business dealings. The suit also condemned baseball’s investigative tactics. In mid-November, Rodriguez’s lawyers called on Selig to testify at the hearing. But baseball objected, and Horowitz ruled that Selig would not have to take the stand. An angry Rodriguez then stormed out of the hearing, shouting obscenities. Rodriguez took his case to the radio , telling WFAN, a New York sports-talk station, that he did not have a chance in the hearing, that Selig hated him and that “he was disgusted with this abusive process.” As a result of this process, he now faces another long separation from baseball after playing in 44 games in 2013. He is fifth on baseball’s career list with 654 home runs, six behind Willie Mays. But in the wake of Horowitz’s ruling, it remains to be seen when, and if, he will get to 661.",

    "source": "Afghanistan and Taliban to Hold Second Round of Talks, Pakistani Officials Say <eos> PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Afghan government officials and Taliban representatives are set to meet again for a second round of peace talks on Friday, two Pakistani government officials said Tuesday. The meetings, to be held in Pakistan, are expected to be more substantive than the previous round of talks, raising hopes that the two sides will be able to find a way to end the conflict in Afghanistan, the senior Pakistani officials said. The first round of talks was also held in Pakistan on July 7. But the entire process “is an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace initiative,” said one Pakistani official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity “out of deference” to the Afghans. “We are here to facilitate.” “The second round will be more substantive and detailed,” the senior government official said. “The fact that the two sides are reconvening in less than a month is encouraging.” But another official cautioned about raising “the expectations bar too high.” “This is just the beginning of a long process,” the official said, who also requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. “Both sides will have to understand each other’s positions and make a determined effort to meet halfway.” “We expect both sides to discuss confidence-building measures, including steps to bring down the level of violence before they move on to discuss the more complex issues to end the conflict in Afghanistan,” he said. He said that Afghan officials seemed ready to hold open discussions with the Taliban. The official said that efforts were being made to persuade the Taliban to send more senior representatives to the talks. “If this happens, the Afghan government would also raise the level of their delegation,” he said. In the first round of talks, the Afghan government was represented by Hekmat Khalil Karzai, the deputy foreign minister, and the Taliban delegation was led by Mullah Abbas Durrani. Asked about reports of a rift within the Taliban ranks over the peace talks, the official said there could be some groups that oppose them. “There are people who want to talk, and there could be people who would want to fight,” the official said. “But the group that has the largest number of fighters on the ground and is able to make an impact will have the sway,” the official said. “And that is the mainstream group that is holding the talks.”",

    "source": "Beijing Hosts Debut of Formula E as Engines Whir Rather Than Roar <eos> BEIJING — The world’s first fully electric motor racing series, featuring battery-powered racecars that can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in three seconds, opened here Saturday. Known as Formula E , this 10-stop international circuit is approved by the International Automobile Federation and aims to inspire developments in electric car technology and attract a new generation of fans. The inaugural race, the Beijing ePrix, was unexpectedly dramatic. A crash at the last turn of the final lap involving the leading cars allowed the Brazilian driver Lucas di Grassi of the Audi Sport ABT team to win. Nicolas Prost had long been in the lead when his car touched Nick Heidfeld’s. Heidfeld’s vehicle flew end over end and landed upside down in pieces. He emerged unscathed. The Beijing ePrix took place in Olympic Park, site of the 2008 Olympics. The cars made 25 laps on the 3.44-kilometer course (about two miles), weaving between the Water Cube and Bird’s Nest. Among the 75,000 people reportedly on site were a large number of local residents who were pleasantly surprised to find an international sporting event to attend as long as they paid the park entrance fee. The series was the brainchild of the federation’s president, Jean Todt, and a Spanish businessman, Alejandro Agag, who came up with the idea in 2011. “We expect this championship to become the framework for research and development around the electric car, a key element for the future of our cities,” Agag told the event’s website. The championship has strong backing — it took $100 million to get the project off the ground — and a number of Formula One veterans like Jarno Trulli strapped into racecars. Sir Richard Branson, the four-time Formula One champion Alain Prost and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio are among the team owners. Unlike other racing series, Formula E schedules practice rounds, qualifying and races into a single day’s program instead of three, making it less disruptive to the host cities where the street circuits have been built. To engage spectators, a gimmick called the FanBoost allows fans to vote for their favorite drivers; the top three get a chance to bump their car’s power for two and a half seconds. “We have 1.4 billion people,” said Steven Lu, chief executive of the China Racing team. “If even .0001 percent of them vote, that’d be enough to win.” Image Lucas Di Grassi of Audi Sport ABT won the first Formula E electric motor race on Saturday at the Olympic Park in Beijing. Credit Adam Dean for The New York Times The fan favorites proved to be di Grassi, Bruno Senna and Katherine Legge, one of two women in the 20-car race. For the series, Michelin designed an 18-inch all-weather tire intended to last an entire race. Each Formula One car receives 52 tires per race weekend; Formula E cars receive 10. All drivers drove a version of the Spark-Renault SRT_01E, equipped with a battery weighing nearly 800 pounds. It has enough power for 20 to 30 minutes of hard racing, so drivers switched cars midway through, substituting the poetry of Formula One pit stop tire changes for a hop into another vehicle. Ho-Pin Tung, a Dutch driver of Chinese descent on the China Racing team, said that the best drivers in this series would be those who mastered the ability to manage the battery’s energy. “In race mode, we will be playing around with the power all the time,” he said. “We have six different engine mappings on the steering wheel, which we have to adjust while driving.” The local fans were disappointed by China Racing’s finish, as Tung placed placing 16th and his teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. placed eighth. What caught Tung by surprise the first time he drove the SRT_01E was the sound of the wind in his helmet. “It’s always there of course, but normally there’s a screaming loud engine behind you,” he said. The electric car’s motor emits an 80-decibel whir, about the same as a garbage disposal, compared with Formula One cars that sound like jet engines. “I had no idea electric cars could be so fast,” said Wang Zhigang, 60, a Beijing native who had seen racing only on television. He added, however, that he would not buy one soon. “The government gives subsidies for them,” he said, “but there are just too few charging stations. What would you do if you ran out of battery here?” But China is seeking to put five million electric cars on the road by 2020 in an effort to cut pollution. Indeed, Lu, whose team played a crucial role in bringing the race to Beijing, said that the Chinese government was willing to host because it wanted to promote electric cars. Speaking of government officials, Lu said: “They said: ‘Wow, this is really new. It’s a golden opportunity. Let’s do that.’ ” Stops on the Formula E circuit include Miami and Long Beach, Calif. The final race is in London in June. A few years ago, few believed this series could come to fruition. Standing on a hastily built viewing platform, Lu was optimistic, saying, “It’s real, it’s fast, and it’s the future.”",

    "source": "In Wireless Spectrum, Competition Is Critical <eos> For all its sleek iThing patina today, the origins of the wireless communications revolution had a decidedly Wild West feel. At the dawn of the cellular phone age, in the early 1980s, the federal government faced a crucial decision: who should get the rights to send signals across the public airwaves, potentially cracking the monopoly of the wired telephone companies? At first, officials chose big cities to introduce the technology, conducting an endless bureaucratic procedure called “comparative hearings” in which they sought to select the best among rival bids. That proved so time-consuming that they soon turned to what seemed a more effective route: give away the rights to use the electromagnetic spectrum through a lottery. They were not prepared, however, for the gold rush that followed. “People tried to get more balls in the lottery drum,” recalled Lawrence Krevor, vice president for government affairs at Sprint Nextel, who co-wrote the lottery order when he was a lawyer at the Federal Communications Commission’s wireless division. “Their wife applied; their parakeet applied; their dog applied.” Dentists, hairdressers, truck drivers, you name it, got together in syndicates to enter the lottery in hundreds of service areas around the country. They used “application mills” like Romulus Engineering of San Francisco, which for $275,000 offered a package of bids in all the 422 rural service areas in the country, with a line of credit from equipment manufacturers to prove their financial wherewithal. Ostensibly committed to deliver cellular phone service wherever they won a license, many winners instead immediately sold the license to a bona fide phone operator. And they made a bundle. The actor Ernest Borgnine hit the jackpot, as part of a syndicate. So did Chuck Hagel, the current defense secretary. Mark R. Warner, now a Democratic senator from Virginia, made a fortune by brokering spectrum between the lucky few and those who bought their licenses. Image A cellphone antenna tower. The F.C.C. allowed AT&T and Verizon to buy a large portion of the spectrum in a 2008 auction. Credit Mel Evans/Associated Press The only outfit that didn’t make any money from the process seems to have been the United States government. Now, Washington is back in the business of putting vast chunks of wireless spectrum on the market. It has learned an important lesson: since 1993, the F.C.C. has leased spectrum to the highest bidder using Dutch auctions. From 2001 to 2010, it reaped a hefty $33 billion on behalf of taxpayers. But there is another lesson that the political system has not learned as well: how to foster competition. Cheap, competitive wireless broadband will be absolutely crucial for advancing the frontier of the digital economy. Yet as the government prepares to sell perhaps the last big chunk of valuable low-frequency spectrum that will be made available for wireless communications and mobile computing, pressure from Congress to raise as much money as possible threatens to get in the way of this objective. The F.C.C. expects to complete the two-part deal by next year, or 2015 at the latest. It will first offer television broadcasters an opportunity to sell their rights to a crucial portion of the spectrum, hoping that many of the marginal channels in big cities offering reruns of “I Love Lucy” and “Hawaii Five-O” will welcome the opportunity to cash out. The agency wants to acquire up to 120 Megahertz of spectrum, with 40 to 80 MHz being the more realistic goal. It will reorganize the spectrum into a big contiguous band — moving TV broadcasters into one compact block — and auction it off to wireless companies that value it much more highly. A critical concern is that AT&T and Verizon Wireless have deep enough pockets and a clear interest in keeping competitors out at any price. The two companies control roughly two-thirds of the cellular communications market and hold the licenses to 80 percent of the far-reaching, low-frequency spectrum most valued by mobile providers. Seizing on the government’s thirst for revenue, the two dominant carriers are hard at work to convince Congress that imposing limits on the spectrum they are allowed to buy would drastically reduce the amount of money the government would generate. “The reduced auction revenues would mean less (and potentially no) broadcast spectrum cleared for mobile wireless use and less (or no) surplus available to fund the Spectrum Act’s other goals,” AT&T wrote to the F.C.C. in April. Congress should not take the bait. Ten years after the 1980s lotteries started, cellphone service across the country still cost about 10 times as much per minute as a landline call. This was probably because only two wireless providers had been licensed in each service area, one of which was owned by the landline company itself. Video Wireless companies say that smartphones are threatening to overwhelm their networks, and are asking the government for help. But some experts maintain that technology already has the answers. Competition briefly flourished in the 1990s. After Congress and the Clinton administration agreed to release a new batch of spectrum that allowed new entrants like Sprint into the wireless market, the price of wireless telephone service fell by a third. Consolidation soon followed, pretty much unimpeded by the F.C.C. and Bush administration antitrust regulators. By 2004, AT&T and Verizon Wireless had nearly 60 percent of the market and wireless prices had broken their fall. Despite the established dominance of AT&T and Verizon Wireless, the F.C.C. allowed them to buy 80 percent of the spectrum in the last big auction of prized TV broadcast spectrum in 2008. Lacking adequate financial resources in the middle of the recession, Sprint and T-Mobile, the ailing third and fourth national mobile carriers, didn’t even bid. The Obama administration is trying to foster more competition. Last year, the Justice Department and the F.C.C. denied AT&T permission to acquire T-Mobile. The acquisition would have given AT&T a 45 percent national market share and entrenched a de facto duopoly which, said a former F.C.C. chairman, Julius Genachowski, “would have been terrible for our innovation economy.” These days, Sprint and T-Mobile are in better shape. In a letter last April, the Justice Department’s antitrust division urged the F.C.C. to set some limits on the spectrum that the larger carriers could acquire “to ensure that the two smaller nationwide carriers are not foreclosed from access” to the valued low-frequency airwaves. Experts like Mark N. Cooper, the research director for the Consumer Federation of America, argue that imposing caps on the big carriers might even increase rather than reduce overall revenue, because it would encourage the participation of smaller rivals who otherwise would stay out. House Republicans remain unconvinced. Instead of defending a competitive market, a group of Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee submitted a letter to the F.C.C. arguing that putting limits on Verizon’s and AT&T’s participation would mean less revenue available to pay broadcasters, build a planned public safety broadband network and reduce the deficit. “The D.O.J. submission appears oblivious of these multiple goals,” they wrote. Forgetting competition, though, would be the worst way to go. As the D.O.J.’s antitrust experts noted in their letter, an auction would be the best way to allocate spectrum if the market were truly competitive, “on the theory that the highest bidder, i.e., the one with the highest private value, will also generate the greatest benefits to consumers.” But that’s not the case when one or two firms control the market. Allowing an oligopoly to stifle the wireless economy would be costly for everybody.",

    "source": "China Pushes Back Against Calls for Yuan Rise <eos> NANJING, CHINA — China pushed back Monday against calls to let its currency rise, with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao warning that an appreciation in the yuan could hobble Chinese growth. Speaking to reporters after a summit meeting with the European Union, Mr. Wen said the demands being made of Beijing to let the yuan strengthen were not fair. He reaffirmed China’s determination to take its own, gradual steps with regards to the currency but said that for now the yuan, also known as the renminbi, would be kept steady. “In this international financial crisis of a kind rarely seen in history, maintaining the basic stability of the renminbi exchange rate has benefited China’s economic development and benefited world economic recovery,” Mr. Wen said. “Now some countries, on the one hand, want the renminbi to appreciate but, on the other hand, engage in brazen trade protectionism against China,” he said. “This is unfair. In fact, it amounts to restricting China’s development.” The E.U. had pushed China to rethink its currency position at the summit meeting, saying the weak yuan, combined with the weak dollar, was hurting European exports. But Mr. Wen swatted away the bloc’s complaints, defending the policy and attacking critics as promoters of a dangerous protectionism that threatened the global economic recovery. The United States in particular has taken a number of steps recently to slow a surge in low-priced imports from China in sectors including steel, tires and paper. “Faced with the present complex economic conditions, we must appropriately handle trade friction and not engage in trade protectionism,” Mr. Wen said. The contentious question of the yuan’s exchange rate has dominated two days of talks with an array of high-ranking E.U. policy makers in this eastern Chinese city. The E.U. is China’s biggest market, absorbing 20 percent of its exports, and runs a large bilateral trade deficit with China. The three top economic officials representing the 16 E.U. members that use the euro pleaded Sunday for a renewed gradual rise in the yuan, which China has virtually pegged to around 6.83 per dollar since July 2008 to help its exporters weather the global credit crunch. The European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, also pressed those demands Sunday, telling Mr. Wen that the low value of the yuan was hurting parts of the E.U. economy. But in his remarks to reporters on Monday, Mr. Barroso did not mention the yuan, and he abruptly cancelled another news conference about the E.U.-China summit. A joint statement issued by the two sides was also devoid of any comments on the currency dispute. While Mr. Wen refused to yield ground on the yuan, he struck a conciliatory tone about another issue important to E.U. leaders: global warming. Mr. Wen said that China would deliver on a promise to curb carbon dioxide emissions, the main greenhouse gas emitted by burning fossil fuels. China’s vow last week to cut “carbon intensity” — the carbon dioxide released in generating each yuan of economic output — by 40 percent to 45 percent by 2020, compared with 2005 levels, was an earnest pledge, Mr. Wen said. But he also restated China’s position that developed countries must lead the way in climate change talks starting next week in Copenhagen by offering big cuts in carbon emissions. Advanced economies must also make financing and technology available to developing countries so that they can tackle global warming, Mr. Wen added.",

Sales by wholesalers rose 0.2 percent in September after a sharp 0.8 percent August decline. That big August setback in sales may have left businesses more cautious about restocking until they see more evidence of rising demand. Swings in inventories can have a big impact on overall economic growth. The inventory increase reflected a 0.8 percent rise in stockpiles of durable goods, with auto inventories rising 1.2 percent and furniture up 1.5 percent.

    "source": "Dominic Orr of Aruba Networks, on Intellectual Honesty <eos> This interview with Dominic Orr, president and C.E.O. of Aruba Networks , a wireless networking company, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant .  Q. What were some early lessons for you as a manager? A. The biggest feedback I had from my people is that I didn’t give them feedback. I was running along. I had a pretty high standard for myself, and I assumed that everybody who joined my team was operating at the same level. Good work was assumed, so I let them know only when something didn’t go well. People started telling me it would be nice if I gave them a pat on the back rather than only telling them when things were not good. Another thing I distinctly remember is that I had trouble having a difficult discussion with employees because, as a young manager, sometimes you don’t really know how to tell somebody to their face that they’re not doing a good job. I also struggled at first with this whole process of running a staff meeting. I remember bringing my H.R. person in to have her run meetings so that I wouldn’t take over, express my opinions and then everybody would sit there silently. Q. What are some other important leadership lessons? A. I have had a very good mentor — Wim Roelandts, who worked for H.P. for about three decades. He rose to become the No. 2 executive of H.P. under Lew Platt. He is someone who embraced the old H.P. way. Q. What were some lessons you learned from him? A. I would say empowering people. Basically, he would push you and give you as much as you could handle until you started failing. He would encourage you to not be afraid of failing — because when you start failing, that’s when you know where your limit is, and then you can improve around that. So he actually sometimes would reward failure because that means that you have pushed yourself. That is an unusual approach, so people under him tended to be able to really find their limits. And once they do that, they figure out a way to overcome it, because they don’t feel that inhibition. I think that is a very big thing. The whole H.P. way of management kind of molded my approach to managing people in business. Q. And boil that down for me. What is the H.P. way? A. Fundamentally, the H.P. way started with the basic assumption that each employee wants to do well, and they are capable of doing well, so as a manager you have to give them that environment to flourish. When someone does not perform, the first reaction is not to get angry at them or assume that they are incompetent, but to question whether they have they been matched to the right assignment. From the background, from the skill set, have you created a productive environment for them? So the first question as a manager is, have you done something wrong? Q. Tell me about the culture of the company you run today. A. I use a simple principle of management based on intellectual honesty. You try to be intellectually honest with yourself, meaning that you have to forget about all the face-saving issues and so on. I tell people that if you work for me, you have to have a thick skin because there’s no time to posture. I also tell people that everybody can be and will be momentarily stupid. I think that in many large companies, a lot of politics arise because somebody makes a statement in a meeting, and then it’s weeks of wasted time and effort because they have to dig in to defend that position, and then politics come into play because they now want to lobby for their position. So when I interview key executives of my staff, I tell them that they need to accept that they can be, and will be, momentarily stupid. If they can accept that and be able to say, “Oh, I was momentarily stupid; let’s move on,” then you don’t waste time dealing with that. Q. How has your leadership style evolved over time? A. The big thing that has changed from 25 years ago is how much I think about the power of the team. I used to, for example, look for two things in people: one is whether I clicked with somebody, and then I would look for best-in-class competence and star performance in a certain discipline, regardless of how they work with others. Now, whenever I’m interviewing for a new executive in any discipline, I look at how they might enhance the capability of the team. Can the dynamics work? And can this person rotate to do some other things? So I would say as I mature, I focus more and more on the performance of the team versus the performance of the individuals. Q. What else are you looking for when you’re interviewing? A. I tend to spend more and more time just understanding where they’re coming from, and do they jibe with me in terms of fundamental human decisions, not just work decisions. Obviously, everybody has different styles and values about family and hobbies, and different dynamics in the way they interact with society. But fundamentally I believe people work for three things. People work for impact — for the company or the industry or humankind. Right? They want to have fun. And they want to get rewarded, and people get rewarded in different ways — through praise, or financial returns. So, ultimately, I try to gauge how the people I’m interviewing are operating on those three dimensions, and then can they have those in this company, in my environment. Can I give this person the impact? Can I give him or her the fun? Is the compensation appropriate? Ultimately, I would say I look for people who have the passion to make the impact, and the passion will be tied to the fun. Because if don’t have the passion, it’s very hard to have the fun component work out. Q. How do you get feedback on how you manage? A. I try to set an example and to be very thick-skinned. I have a very open door. I encourage a lot of feedback so that my staff has no inhibitions to just tell me that I was momentarily stupid or I actually was wrong in some way. Sometimes I argue. Sometimes in the end I’ll say, “I still want to go with my hunch.” I think I would fail in this whole management philosophy if my staff couldn’t be intellectually honest with me. That’s one principle I try very, very hard to set by example. Q. And how do you put that into effect so people don’t take it personally? A. Just recently I handled one of those moments. I sometimes write an e-mail to someone and will add a section that begins, “Start of intellectual honesty moment,” and then I will be just doubly hard on them, and then I will write, “End moment,” and then I continue the e-mail. So you create, really, a little space for people. The point is to be very honest, and I try to do it one on one so they save face. The major thing you want to accomplish is to not make it personal. Then people will feel that you’re not attacking them. You’re just attacking the issue, the fact that he was behaving a certain way and you make it very kind of private. Having said that, I would add that I still do have occasional outbursts in my staff meetings, mainly either because I wanted to get a point across to the group or because I am genuinely upset when I feel there has been silent disagreement from somebody or if they have stubbornly not aligned with the team’s goal. Q. Why do think this is so important to your culture? A. You look at the competitive space we’re in. The only reason we have come so far and we’ll be able to sustain our gains in market share is because we have more focus and we move faster. I tell everybody, “If you think we have better talent than our competitors, dream on, because they have very deep talent, too.” The only thing that we can do is we can focus and we can move faster. And the one thing that allows me to move faster than the much bigger companies I compete with is I have less politics. The way I want to encourage my team is to tell them that we aspire to be the largest small company in our space, and the smallest part is about me not wanting to give up the speed. I don’t want politicking, and I’m truly convinced that politics arise because people dig into their position because they have ego tied to it. I’m trying to extend my speed as long as possible, and I defuse a lot of politics by telling people: “You don’t need to dig into your position. Just be intellectually honest.” That’s my tool to break up all these potential blocks of ice that then maybe become icebergs. Q. What else do you do to create that culture? A. At Aruba, if you distill our culture into one phrase, it’s customer first/customer last. The company is organized around solving big customer issues, winning new accounts. I find it’s very pragmatic. If you can create a culture that’s all customer-first, it becomes the lens for looking at problems that might otherwise be looked at in many different ways. And it also becomes a tiebreaker. When many people say, “I want to do it this way,” they’ll say, “Have you asked the customer?” If you are the customer, how do you think about it? I find that so many times it just makes the battle easier. It helps get the whole company marching in one direction. Q. What else is unusual about your culture? A. Two years ago, we adopted this new policy for all North American employees — a no-vacation policy. Basically there is no fixed vacation. There used to be a two-week vacation starting out, one week sick time. We realized it’s very hard. Some people work throughout the weekend. Others work at home, and then they need to take three hours, four hours off to go to the dentist, and you say it’s comp time. So having to track all this becomes very amorphous and hard. Fundamentally we’re saying that you of course should take time for vacation, as long as you make sure you also get your work done. Employees discuss it with their supervisors, and it has worked. For two years now, there’s no change of vacation habits. So, basically, what we realized in this day and age — and in our industry, which is information-driven — what you really want is the mind-share of your employees, not timeshare. In fact, you actually get a more powerful work force. You get more of their time when you’re saying do it anywhere, and they end up giving you more mind-share, which is more important than giving you more timeshare. So that really is a big enlightenment for me in this job — that the work force, the workplace, is fundamentally transformed because of technology. Q. Did some people say the new vacation policy was a risky step? A. Believe me, we had a huge debate. Some people said, “You’re putting pressure on me.” What you’re really putting pressure on is for them to set really clear, effective and measurable milestones. So you are really requiring managers to be much crisper in terms of expectations. That was kind of the tension, but now. two years afterward, we haven’t seen any abuse of the system. Q. How would you summarize your leadership philosophy? A. I think a leader ultimately has to lead with the heart, lead by example and lead with passion. Many people can have the strategy. They can explain things. A lot of people have the analytical skills, but fundamentally I think great leadership means that the people who you’re leading feel you, and sometimes you don’t even need to say a lot of words. And the way they feel you is they know that you care, that you believe in what you say. You have the passion and you live by it.",

The rating fell 32 percent and the viewership dropped 27 percent from last year, when Summer Bird won.The figures are from the period from 5:24 to 7:10 p.m. eastern, which is called the race portion. By comparison, the 2007 race, which was won by Rags to Riches, had a slightly higher rating of a 3.2, but its viewership was the same as Saturday’s. In 2000, Commendale’s victory had a 2.8 rating with 3.8 million viewers, but those figures are for the full telecast, not just the race portion, as designated by the network. In 1996, when Editor’s Note won, the full broadcast produced a 2.9 rating with a 3.68 million viewers. Belmont viewership is often low when a Triple Crown is not at stake, as was the case Saturday.

However, I am disappointed that your article did not focus on the evidence-based treatments for migraine, and instead mentioned “treatments” that are not considered evidence-based. In addition, neurologists and headache specialists are trained physicians in evaluating and treating this highly prevalent and disabling condition. In fact, there are over 500 United Council of Neurologic Subspecialties certified headache specialists in the country. Perhaps the article could have encouraged individuals to seek professional medical help from a trained medical provider.

A Horse Is Not a Person To the Sports Editor: Sports Illustrated has named Serena Williams as the newly rechristened honor of Sportsperson of the Year. She is clearly a worthy recipient. But American Pharoah was a finalist for this newly renamed award. Huh? Though the Supreme Court has anointed corporations as persons, neither it, nor any other body of substance, has done the same for those of the equine persuasion. If a thoroughbred can be Sportsperson of the Year, could I be in the running for horse of the year? ANDREW E. RUBIN, Marina del Rey, Calif. A Sport Denounced To the Sports Editor: Re “Conor McGregor Ends Title Bout With One Punch,” Dec. 14: Your coverage of the mixed martial arts fight between Conor McGregor and José Aldo was offensive and gratuitous. The video of Conor leveling Aldo and pummeling his face on the ground was an example of the mindless brutality of this “sport.” The broad coverage of Ronda Rousey, including her loss to Holly Holm, was similarly graphic and unnecessary. Mixed martial arts may be called a sport, but it is a primitive and disgusting one. It desensitizes its wild-eyed fans, who seem to derive great glee from the barbaric sight of two men or two women brutalizing each other. Might The New York Times consider ending its complicity with this awful activity? STEVE NELSON, New York Soldier Field Loses Status To the Sports Editor: Re “Still Standing in Chicago,” Dec. 13: Michael Beschloss’s article about Chicago’s Soldier Field omits an essential postscript: The United States Interior Department, following the recommendation of the National Park Service, stripped the renovated stadium (originally known as Grant Park Stadium) of National Historic Landmark status in 2006. The decision, which the Park Service based on “incompatible construction and the destruction of substantial historic material,” sent a strong message: Changes to the nation’s most venerated structures should respect, not destroy, the integrity of the original design. BLAIR KAMIN, Chicago The writer is The Chicago Tribune’s architecture critic. Gift Idea’s Message To the Sports Editor: Re “A Time Machine and Gifts That Are Less Realistic,” Dec. 13: After reading through nearly two pages of wonderful sports fantasy gifts, I was disgusted to find that your “editing elves” thought an appropriate choice of fantasy was for someone to wish to intentionally hurt an athlete. Chase Utley is a great ballplayer, always playing his hardest to help his team win. I’m sorry for what happened to Ruben Tejada, and I’ll bet Chase is, too. What a terrible message it sends to think that beating him up in a boxing ring or having a fastball thrown at his head would bring someone joy. You couldn’t do better? Shame on you.

    "source": "Burberry Warns of Weakness in Luxury Market <eos> PARIS — Burberry, the iconic British fashion retailer, sent shock waves through the global luxury industry on Tuesday, saying that it had begun to see signs of weakness in the market and that its annual profit would probably disappoint investors. The company, based in London, said sales were flat at stores open a year or more so far in the quarter that began in July, slowing from the previous quarter, and warned that it had observed “a deceleration in recent weeks.” Burberry, the first to update the market on recent trading, said it now expected profit for its financial year through March 2013 “to be around the lower end of market expectations.” Angela Ahrendts, the Burberry chief executive, said in a statement that “the external environment is becoming more challenging,” and that as a result the company was “tightly managing discretionary costs and taking appropriate actions to protect short-term profitability.” Burberry did not single out any particular region. Of the company’s main customers, known in the industry as traveling luxury consumers, just over a third are in Asia, a quarter in the Americas, and a little less than a third in Europe. With the Chinese economy losing steam, many in the industry fear that an important pillar of sales could be wobbling. Yet as the luxury industry’s growth in Asia has slowed, the companies note, Chinese tourists have helped support demand for its products in Europe. Burberry cautioned that China might be simply taking a breather, with an impending change in leadership leading to a decline in conspicuous consumption, as well as a fall in gift-giving by Chinese travelers. Analysts are now watching to see whether Burberry’s rivals follow with their own warnings. “It seems unlikely that Burberry would be the only one affected,” said Catherine Rolland, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets. “Other operators have also been experiencing a slowdown, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.” Ms. Rolland said it was “still a bit too early to know” if the market was experiencing a minor setback or something more serious. Burberry reported a profit of £376 million, or $603 million, for its most recent year, and the lower end of analysts’ expectations for its adjusted pretax profit of £407 million would still be a substantial increase. But the company has been a standout performer on the stock exchange, and the latest warning comes just two months after Burberry reported a 5 percent decrease in licensing income. Burberry stock plummeted in London trading Tuesday, giving up 21 percent of its value. In Paris, shares of the industry giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton fell 3 percent, while its French rival PPR closed down 2 percent. Richemont fell 5 percent in Zurich.

    "source": "Wal-Mart Stock Falls Nearly 5% After Report of Quashed Bribery Inquiry <eos> Wal-Mart ’s stock fell almost 5 percent on Monday, accounting for about one-fifth of the losses in the Dow Jones industrial average, as investors reacted to a bribery scandal at the retailer’s Mexican subsidiary and a report that an internal investigation was quashed at corporate headquarters in Arkansas. The New York Times reported on Sunday that Wal-Mart investigators had found credible evidence that the subsidiary, Wal-Mart de Mexico, had paid millions of dollars in bribes to support expansion in Mexico, where the retailer has one in five of its stores. Told of this evidence in 2005, top executives in Bentonville, Ark., shut down the investigation, The Times reported. On Monday, politicians from Washington to Mexico City called for outside investigations into Wal-Mart’s conduct. The fallout for Wal-Mart could be significant. A settlement of any sort would very likely include large fines by both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Matthew J. Feeley, who works on cases involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at the law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney. Any executive found guilty of a crime, moreover, could face jail time, Mr. Feeley said. Several former and current Wal-Mart executives in Mexico and in the United States were implicated in the bribery accusations or were involved in the subsequent decision not to alert law enforcement authorities. “I think there’s going to be a lot of pressure to come down hard on them as a company, not entirely because of the actual violations but because of the failure to do anything internally when those violations came to light,” Mr. Feeley said. The uncertainty made investors anxious on Monday. Wal-Mart’s stock lost $2.91 in heavy trading, to $59.54. Wal-Mart de Mexico’s stock, traded separately, fell more than 12 percent to 37.89 pesos. A Wal-Mart spokesman, David Tovar, said in a statement that the audit committee of Wal-Mart’s board had been overseeing an investigation of Wal-Mart’s compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act since the fall, and that outside legal counsel and forensic accountants were reporting regularly to the audit committee about findings. Wal-Mart hired the law firm Jones Day to look into the bribery questions. It also hired the law firm Greenberg Traurig to conduct a worldwide review of the company’s compliance with F.C.P.A., as well as KPMG to handle forensic accounting. In Washington, two Democratic representatives, Elijah E. Cummings, of Maryland, and Henry A. Waxman, of California, said they had requested a meeting with company officials and were contacting other people who might have knowledge of the bribery allegations. Critics of Wal-Mart in New York, including some elected officials, union leaders and small-business groups, said the company’s actions in Mexico cemented their opposition to Wal-Mart’s opening a store in the city. “This is precisely the type of business we do not want in our communities and I remain committed to fighting against Wal-Mart’s corporate poison from entering the five boroughs,” Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, said in a statement. Bill de Blasio, the city’s public advocate, and the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, also issued statements criticizing Wal-Mart. Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, asked Wal-Mart to detail all the spending it has done and donations it has made with regard to opening a store in New York. Wal-Mart’s current chief executive, Michael T. Duke, was told about the allegations regarding bribery in Mexico in 2005, when he was given responsibility for all foreign subsidiaries, The Times reported. The internal investigation was ended after the chief executive at the time, H. Lee Scott Jr., now a Wal-Mart board member, rebuked internal investigators for being overly aggressive, the article on Sunday said. Eduardo Castro-Wright, the former head of Wal-Mart’s United States operations who was promoted to vice chairman in 2008, was identified by a former company lawyer in Mexico as the driving force behind years of bribery when he was in charge of Wal-Mart de Mexico. Mr. Tovar declined to comment on whether the board was considering actions against the executives. Mr. Castro-Wright announced in September that he would retire, surprising analysts. The announcement of the retirement was unrelated to Wal-Mart’s query into foreign corrupt practices, Mr. Tovar said. Mr. Castro-Wright had said he would step down on July 1, 2012, and that timing has not changed, Mr. Tovar said. Mr. Castro-Wright has been a board member at MetLife since 2008. John Calagna, a spokesman for MetLife, said in a statement that “MetLife became aware of this situation through recent media reports. Wal-mart has indicated in these reports that it is investigating the matter. Therefore it would not be appropriate for MetLife to comment at this time.” Several executives involved in the inquiry no longer work at Wal-Mart, although there is no indication that their departures were related to the bribery case. Michael Fung, chief financial officer for Wal-Mart’s United States stores, retired effective Feb. 1, Mr. Tovar said. According to the article, Mr. Fung, then an internal auditor, was given a memo with a detailed account of a former executive’s complaints about bribery in 2005. And Joseph R. Lewis, a top internal investigator on the Mexico charges in 2005, also retired recently, Mr. Tovar confirmed. Craig Herkert, who is now the chief of the grocery chain Supervalu, was told about the charges in 2005, according to the article. A Supervalu spokesman, Michael A. Siemienas, said in an e-mail that “based on the information we have, this is strictly a Wal-Mart matter.” And John B. Menzer, a former Wal-Mart vice chairman who is now chief of the craft retailer Michaels Stores, was also involved. Mr. Menzer intervened in a separate investigation regarding an executive who reported to him, taking authority in the inquiry away from Wal-Mart’s corporate-investigations unit and transferring the inquiry to a subordinate of the person being investigated, according to The Times. That subordinate subsequently cleared his boss. Michaels, which filed for an initial public offering in March, said last week that Mr. Menzer had been hospitalized. Allen Questrom, a former chief of J. C. Penney and Federated Department Stores who was on Wal-Mart’s board from 2007 until 2010, said he was surprised to hear of the accusations. “It was never something that was discussed at the board level when I was there,” he said.",

    "source": "Charles B. Wang, the Islanders’ Unorthodox Owner <eos> On the day he elevated Garth Snow from backup goaltender to general manager in 2006, Charles B. Wang , the Islanders ’ owner, conceded that the move was unorthodox but said that much of his business career had been based on doing things differently. Of course, what some call unorthodox strikes others as, well, eccentric or weird. Shifting Snow from the goal crease to the front office has not restored the franchise to glory. In the years since, the team has made one playoff appearance and has had five consecutive postseason-free losing seasons. But then Wang was, from the start, a basketball fan and a hockey novice. Mike Milbury, a former general manager of the Islanders, recalled that Wang wanted to get rid of the team’s scouts (to rely on the league’s central scouting system) and try out sumo wrestlers as goaltenders. “He assumed that nobody could put a goal past a sumo wrestler,” Milbury said in a telephone interview from Boston. But, Milbury added, Wang’s heart was in the right place. “He was a man of his word, a guy who desperately wanted to keep the team on the Island,” he said. Wang was unable to secure a renovated or new arena in Uniondale. But the announcement on Wednesday that the team has agreed to join the Nets in 2015 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn means that the franchise is still, geographically, on Long Island. “Hello, Brooklyn!” he said at a news conference at Barclays, wearing a blue pinstriped suit and an Islanders tie. Wang, who made his fortune in the computer software business, will remain the sole owner of the Islanders. He said that he did not offer to sell a portion of the team to Bruce Ratner, the majority owner of the arena, and that Ratner did not ask. The team will not become the Brooklyn Islanders, and Snow will remain the general manager. Wang and his partner Sanjay Kumar were an odd couple, certainly in sports ownership, when they acquired the team in 2000. Wang was born in Shanghai, grew up in Flushing and attended Queens College. Kumar — who by 2007 would be in federal prison for securities fraud — immigrated from Sri Lanka. They were running Computer Associates International, a software maker that Wang had co-founded. On the day they took control, Wang offered a vow typical of owners buying losing teams: to restore it to first-class status. But, he said, “we are not medicine men promising a very quick cure.” He chided the Rangers for their high payroll and, with a gleeful smile, said, “Ooh, that’s mean to Chuck,” referring to Charles F. Dolan, the head of Cablevision, the Rangers’ owner. Over time, though, Wang has more than matched Dolan in the volume of turnover in senior management. Wang’s second general manager, Neil Smith, was fired after 40 days. “His vision of how he wanted the organization to work internally — and mine — were total opposites, and it couldn’t work,” said Smith, who built the Rangers team that won the 1994 Stanley Cup and is now a television analyst. “He owned the team, and he won.” But owning the team has been a losing proposition. By 2003, Wang said that the Islanders had lost $52.2 million on his watch. “The team has to be self-sustaining,” he said. “This is not a church that will stay open forever.” The doors to the church stayed open, however. By 2009, he told Newsday that he would not have bought the team if knew how difficult it would be, with playing at the aging Nassau Coliseum and failing to get a new or renovated arena. By then, Newsday reported, he had spent $209 million to keep the team solvent. None of that should have made any sense to Wang, who has a mathematics degree. By then he had accumulated more in losses than what he and Kumar had paid for the team: $187.5 million. Wang’s penchant for some peculiar long-term contracts might forever cling to him. In 2001, he signed Alexei Yashin to a 10-year, $87.5 million contract. But Yashin was not the superstar Wang hoped for, and Wang paid him nearly $18 million to buy out the remaining four years of the deal. Milbury said he wished he had balked at the deal, “but it was his money.” Soon after, Wang gave Michael Peca a five-year deal; Milbury said he managed to talk Wang out of giving Peca 10 years, too. Five years later, Wang wielded his checkbook to give goaltender Rick DiPietro what was then the longest contract in N.H.L. history: $67.5 million over 15 years. At the time, Wang said that “this is not a big deal,” and that it was no different than some other major commitments in his business career. “Now I’m doing it in sports,” he said, “and everybody is like: ‘Oh, my God. How could he do that?’ ” People are still asking that; the often-injured DiPietro has not lived up to Wang’s hopes for him. The same could be said for his team, which will be a lame duck at a substandard arena for three years. The future will be one in which his landlord, Ratner, is a friend who shares his passion for photography. “I’m a tenant,” Wang said, but in the sort of arena that he aspired to build, without success.",

    "source": "Credit Default Swaps Make Restructuring More Difficult <eos> Several years ago I wrote an article predicting that the growth of credit default swaps would make it increasingly difficult to restructure distressed companies. The drama surrounding a Norwegian paper maker shows that, if anything, I understated the potential problem. Norske Skog, which describes itself as multinational “manufacturers of lightweight, coated and uncoated newsprint and magazine paper,” is in the midst of an exchange offer. In that respect, it is like many other companies, although Norske Skog is the rare one that is not in the oil and gas sector. The company agreed on the terms of the exchange with Blackstone’s GSO Capital Partners unit and Cyrus Capital Partners LP, both of which hold some of its unsecured bonds as well as a good bit of its equity. Under the exchange offer, certain bondholders scheduled to be repaid this year and next are being asked to accept a motley package of securities, including new debt secured by some European assets, in place of their current bonds. Certain secured bondholders sued to block the exchange offer, arguing that it was not permitted by the contract under which they purchased the bonds — known as an indenture. A state court temporarily blocked the offer. After the case moved to federal court, the judge there said the exchange offer was probably impermissible under the indenture , but he refused to block it. In short, the judge was saying that any violation of the indenture could be rectified by the payment of money damages or other remedies after the fact. That is a somewhat dicey proposition when we are talking about a distressed company, but the federal court suggested these sorts of things are better addressed by bankruptcy judges. Covenant Review , the bond research organization, has since come out with a report arguing that the judge was wrong on the first point. It said the bond indenture allowed the exchange offer to include the new secured bonds. I have not seen the report, but I know who wins the fight between a research firm and a federal judge. Nonetheless, Covenant Review’s entry into the fray certainly does not make this jumble any clearer. At the same time, it has also been said that various parties in this battle have either bought or sold credit default swap contracts on Norske Skog . As a result, their incentives for supporting or opposing the exchange offer might be somewhat less than clear, since the presence of the derivatives means that they are no longer acting as “pure bondholders.” Funds that have sold swap contracts would want to avoid a restructuring until those contracts expire, whereas funds that bought the swap contracts would want to trigger them sooner rather than later. At least one fund involved in the exchange offer denied that it lacked proper incentives, although its letter was carefully phrased. That certainly suggests there are credit default swap contracts lurking out there. Despite the financial crisis, and the significant changes created by the Dodd-Frank financial reform act with regard to the regulation of the over-the-counter swap market — which includes credit default swaps — the role of the swap contracts in financial distress remains largely beyond the pale. Nobody really knows where any bondholder’s interest lies these days, and that means that workouts are inherently more complex .",

A patch of blueberry bushes was just fruiting for a harvest around mid-July, the berry clusters still green with a slight purple blush. Before the blueberries, the raspberries will ripen, probably in early July; thornless blackberries come in August. “That blackberry was the best berry I ever gambled with,” Ms. DiVello said. “The ones you get in the store are so sour and tart, but these are wonderful.” You can buy containers of prepicked berries from the farm at the white lattice farm stand on the property, but Ms. DiVello says most people like to pick their own when they are still warm from the sun. Pick-your-own berries are $5 for a container (strawberries are sold by the quart; blueberries, raspberries and blackberries by the pint). Prepicked berries cost $5.50. Ms. DiVello has worked this 20-acre farm, formerly known as Harbes Berry Farm, since 1975, but she decided to change the name last year to avoid confusion with Harbes Farm and Vineyard , which has three North Fork locations and is owned by one of her brothers, Ed Harbes, and his family. Although Ms. DiVello’s parents and grandparents grew potatoes, pumpkins and cabbages on this land, she always preferred berries and flowers. Now she plants 15 blooms, including sunflowers, dahlias, zinnias, gladiolas, snapdragons and peonies. They are sold at the farm stand by the bunch ($8.50). SUSAN M.

    "source": "Ford to Keep Fiesta Production in Germany <eos> BERLIN — The Ford Motor Company will keep production of the Fiesta, its top-selling car in Europe, in Germany after agreeing with workers to cut assembly costs, part of an effort to end years of losses from its European operations. The company said Tuesday that management and workers had agreed to scrap costly night shifts, increase flexibility on working hours and reassign work from suppliers to Ford, which would result in total savings of about $400 million from 2017 to 2021. Ford is hoping the cost-cutting at its plant in Cologne, where the Fiesta hatchback is made, will help its European operations to become profitable in 2015. Ford has lost money in Europe since 2011. “The agreement will make the plant more cost-efficient, ensuring that next-generation Fiesta production will be globally competitive,” Ford said. The company will also hire about 500 engineers at its development center in Cologne, one of two German factories, which employs about 4,100 people. The brand is releasing at least 25 new or upgraded vehicles from 2012 to 2017, including the EcoSport compact S.U.V. and the larger Edge model, and is pushing higher-end versions of existing models. The agreement announced on Tuesday ends months of uncertainty for employees in Germany. News outlets had reported that Ford might relocate production of the new Fiesta to Romania, where costs are lower and where 3,600 workers already produce the B-Max model at a plant in Craiova. “We absolutely looked at other plants,” Barb J. Samardzich, chief operating officer at Ford’s European division, said during a conference call. Germany has one of the highest labor costs for manufacturing in the world, with workers earning 36.98 euros, or $50.10, an hour in 2012, compared with €29.56 in Japan, €25.87 in the United States and €3.78 in Romania, according the Cologne Institute for Economic Research. Ford closed two smaller manufacturing operations in Britain last year and plans to shut an assembly plant in Genk, Belgium, cutting about 5,700 jobs in total.",

    "source": "Despite Telltale Signs, Ottawa Gunman Was Not Flagged as a Threat <eos> OTTAWA — The Canadian police acknowledged on Thursday that the gunman who traumatized the capital in a deadly shooting rampage had not been identified as a security threat despite his criminal record in three cities, embrace of extremist ideas and intent to travel to Syria. The police also conceded that they did not even know that the gunman, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, had been in the capital for nearly three weeks. The revelations at a news conference came a day after the gunman paralyzed the heart of the capital, killing a soldier at a war memorial before he was shot dead in the halls of Parliament. The new detailed information helped fill in vast gaps about Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau’s surprise assault, including chilling video footage of his arrival on Parliament Hill. Commissioner Bob Paulson of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the gunman’s motives remained largely unknown, but the commissioner said he was confident that Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau had acted alone and had no strong ties to other extremists. The commissioner, the head of Canada’s national police, said that much remained a mystery about the shooting frenzy that led to Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau’s death, trapped thousands of people in downtown Ottawa and, at one point, left Prime Minister Stephen Harper without bodyguards and separated only by a wooden door from a gunfight. “The R.C.M.P. did not even know Mr. Zehaf was in Ottawa,” Commissioner Paulson said during the lengthy news conference. “We need to look at all operations to deal with this difficult and hard-to-understand threat.” The police, he said, had only learned about Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau’s Syrian travel plans from his mother after his death. Nor was he among the 93 people that the national police forces monitor as being likely to travel abroad to join organizations recognized as terror groups under Canadian law. All the commissioner could offer as explanation for the violence of Wednesday was a combination of Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau’s growing frustration over delays in his passport application, his apparent sympathies for radicalism and his “difficult circumstances,” which appeared to include drug use, unemployment and mental health problems. Video At a news conference, the Ottawa Police Service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police released surveillance footage from outside the Canadian Parliament building during an attack Wednesday. Credit Credit Associated Press The police determined that Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau, who was born in Montreal, had arrived in Ottawa as early as Oct. 2. He had come to the capital, Commissioner Paulson said, apparently hoping to expedite his passport application, a process that the police had not blocked. He moved into the Ottawa Mission, a homeless shelter less than a 10-minute walk from the National War Memorial, where Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau would shoot and kill Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the single father of a young child from Hamilton, Ontario. About two days before the attack, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau was a fixture in the shelter’s main sitting room, having loud conversations on a pay phone, his frustration appearing to mount as he made call after call looking for an inexpensive “junker” car, said Paul MacIntyre, 52, a resident who overheard him. “Anybody living in a rooming house who has 600 to 700 bucks to blow on a junker,” seems out of place, he said. “With that you could get a bus ticket all the way across the country.” A striking figure, with black curls to his shoulders, a small mustache and goatee, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau was frequently seen prostrate on a small prayer mat he kept for praying in the stairwells, said another resident, David Duchesne, 50. On Tuesday, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau found his junker — an aging, beige Toyota Corolla. Shortly before 9:50 a.m. the following morning, he illegally and conspicuously parked it behind the war memorial on the busy thoroughfare and transit route that also runs in front of Parliament, Commissioner Paulson said. Approaching from behind, outside Corporal Cirillo’s vision, he shot him at close range with a Winchester rifle, a firearm his criminal conviction had prohibited him from owning. He also shot at but missed a second ceremonial guard, who has not been identified. As the driver for Canada’s top military commander, who was waiting outside Mr. Harper’s office across the street, attempted to give chase on foot, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau jumped into the Toyota, made a U-turn and headed toward an entrance to Parliament Hill that has bollards to limit entry only to pedestrians. Surveillance video footage, taken from multiple angles, shows pedestrians initially hiding behind the entrance’s Gothic Revival stone entrance posts as they hear the gunfire at the war memorial and then scattering when Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau jumps out of the Toyota with his rifle. Other cameras show him running up to the entrance of the east block, one of the three structures making up the Parliament Buildings. Image Kevin Vickers, Parliament's sergeant-at-arms, has been credited with shooting the gunman just outside the party caucus rooms. Credit Chris Wattie/Reuters Waving his weapon, the gunman then menaced the driver of an empty cabinet-minister’s car, who ran away. The gunman got in and, with the driver’s door still open, raced up to the center block with its distinctive clock tower. As he ran into its main door at the base of the Peace Tower, police cruisers were in pursuit. Inside, the shooting began immediately. But 10 seconds elapsed before the first of the chasing officers reached the door. “It only took one minute and 20 seconds for this individual to go from Wellington to center block,” Commissioner Paulson said. “It was incredibly quick.” The investigation into exactly what happened inside, Commissioner Paulson said, was incomplete. But he did describe a gun battle between Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms at the House of Commons, and the gunman, with each taking shelter behind stone pillars. The head of the national police force indirectly acknowledged reports that Mr. Harper’s bodyguards, members of the mounted police, were not in his party’s caucus room as the gun battle raged immediately outside. He said that the policy had now been changed to have protection always present. The drama and anxiety stretched on for hours after Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau was killed outside the entrance to the Parliament’s library as the police continued to hunt for other possible assailants. The lockdown included a room by room search of the Parliament buildings as well as of nearby office buildings. Thousands of workers were ordered away from windows and many squeezed into windowless meeting rooms in their office after being locked in their buildings. Many members of Parliament were not released from secure areas in the main Parliament building until nearly 10 hours had passed. Chief Charles Bordeleau of the Ottawa Police Service said the prolonged search had been provoked by 911 calls indicating that there had been a shooting and carjacking at a downtown shopping mall and that an armed man was hiding on the ornate copper-clad roof of the center block. Mr. Harper has blamed radicalism inspired by the Islamic State for the assault. The group is the target of an American-led aerial campaign in Iraq and Syria. The shooting came only two days after another deadly assault on a uniformed member of Canada’s armed forces, deepening worries that the attacks could be linked to Canada’s supporting role in the campaign against the Islamic State. This week, Canada sent six fighter jets to attack Islamic State targets in Iraq following a request for assistance from the United States. Mr. Harper strongly supports the campaign against the Islamic State, the Sunni militant group also known as ISIS or ISIL. “We will not be intimidated,” Mr. Harper said when Parliament resumed on Thursday to punctuate its determination to resume normality. “We will be vigilant but we will not run scared. We will be prudent but we will not panic.” Mr. Vickers had put away his pistol and was back in his robes performing the more familiar role of parading a ceremonial mace. As he made his way along Parliament’s Hall of Honor, where the gunman was killed, Mr. Vickers passed by walls damaged by bullets. Parliament broke with protocol and allowed television stations to show the entry of the mace into the House of Commons. Members rose in a prolonged standing ovation for Mr. Vickers that, at times, seemed to put him on the verge of tears. Mr. Harper walked down the chamber to shake hands with Mr. Vickers. Normally partisan and rarely given to public gestures of warmth, Mr. Harper also embraced and shook hands with Tom Mulcair and Justin Trudeau, the leaders of the two main opposition parties. The prime minister and his wife, Laureen, also laid a wreath at the National War Memorial. Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau, whose parents had changed his name from Michael Joseph Hall when he was a teenager, was originally from the Montreal suburb of Laval. Police said that his father is Libyan and that Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau may also hold citizenship in that country. In recent years, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau lived in Vancouver and its suburbs and he was previously a resident of Calgary, Alberta. He had several, mostly petty drug-related, criminal convictions in all three cities. But Commissioner Paulson said that there were no apparent links between him a group of radical Islamists in Calgary. At the moment, he said Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau’s only tie to other radicals was that his email address was found on the hard drive of an unidentified man who has been arrested on suspicion of a terrorism-related offense. “What does that mean?” the commissioner asked, acknowledging that it was a weak connection. Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau’s parents said in a statement on Thursday that they were shocked by his actions and saddened by the corporal’s death. “He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow,” the parents, Susan Bibeau and Bulgasem Zehaf, said of the soldier in a statement given to The Associated Press. “We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless.”",

    "source": "Everybody’s Favorite Formula One Throwback <eos> The Monaco Grand Prix is probably the only race on the Formula One calendar where the poor race performances of great drivers and the superb performances of lesser drivers share the spotlight with the achievements of the finest drivers. It’s a race that is remembered as much for Ayrton Senna’s crash 12 laps from the end while dominating it in 1988 — the Brazilian lost concentration, hit a wall and lost the victory — as it is for his record of winning there six times. Alain Prost’s desire that the rain-drenched 1984 race be ended before the young Senna, who had climbed up from 13th on the grid to second, could catch him is as memorable as Prost’s four victories there. Then there are the triumphs of the outsiders, like Jean-Pierre Beltoise, a Frenchman whose only race victory came there in 1972, in the rain in an underpowered BRM car. And the Monaco Grand Prix is also remembered for its accidents, such as when Alberto Ascari flew off the track in his Lancia and into the harbor in 1955 or when Lorenzo Bandini crashed his Ferrari in the 1967 race and died three days later. The running of the Monaco Grand Prix this weekend marks the 20th anniversary of one of its wackiest editions. In that 1996 race, the French driver Olivier Panis drove his Ligier to his only Formula One victory, moving up from 14th position to finish first among the only three cars that finished the race. With a history marked by both extreme joy and horrendous pain, a history dictated by the unorthodox nature of the street circuit winding through the ancient principality on the Mediterranean, the race and Formula One could be said to have a love-hate relationship. In Monaco, the teams have the most constrained working environment of the season and the drivers have their biggest challenge. But the site also helps create one of the season’s most exciting races and attracts the greatest interest from fans, sponsors and media around the world. “I respect Monaco, I think it is a great thing to have as a part of our championship,” said Pat Symonds, the technical director of the Williams team. “But I don’t really enjoy it particularly. Yet I think it’s great to have that sort of challenge in the championship.” “Can you imagine if it didn’t exist, and someone said, ‘Well, let’s go and do it now?”’ he added. “There would be an absolute outrage, wouldn’t there?” All eyes this weekend will be on the rivalry at the top of the championship, between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg of the Mercedes team. Rosberg has won the last three editions of the Monaco race and is leading the series, 43 points ahead of Hamilton, who is in third place. “It’s an incredible feeling making a car dance through those streets, one of the purest thrills you can have in a racing car,” Hamilton said. “I’ve not had the best run of results in Monaco in recent years — but last year showed I have the pace to do the job.” Rosberg’s three victories in a row in what he considers his home race — he is German but grew up in Monaco and still lives there — came while he was driving in the same team as Hamilton. While Hamilton has won the championship in the last two seasons — outperforming Rosberg over the full seasons — he has won in Monaco only once, in 2008. Symonds said Monaco was a track that seemed to invite victories by both the very best drivers as well as by the occasional odd man out who has a particular style that works well on the atypical circuit. “You need to have a car that the guys can trust; they need to have real confidence in the car,” he said. “A lot of it is about getting a car that is stable. But at the same time, if you have a car that is stable in the classic sense — there is a bit of an understeer and everything — it’s not the way to go quickly around Monaco.” “This is why I think you have people like Michael and Ayrton who were so good around Monaco — because they could keep their cars on that stability limit,” Symonds added, referring to Michael Schumacher, who won five times in Monaco, and Senna. “It is more important on those slow tracks than it is on the fast tracks. They could get it on the stability limit and they still have the confidence to take the thing to within a millimeter of the barrier, which is pretty impressive.” And while most team engineers will say that it is a track more about the driver than about the car, drivers are more likely to talk about how fabulous it feels when things are done right and how bad it feels when things are ever-so-slightly wrong. “I like Monaco if we are competitive,” said Felipe Massa, who drives for the Williams team. “If we start behind, nobody likes Monaco.” He was referring to the importance of scoring a pole position, because on Monaco’s narrow street track, with barriers so close, it is almost impossible to pass another car. “Any overtake attempt you make could end up in contact with your competitor or the wall, so you really have to balance the risk and reward,” said Joylon Palmer, a driver at the Renault team. “You have to get your move right and hope the other guy sees you. Even if you do everything right, if your rival doesn’t see you it’s likely there’ll be contact.” For the commercial promoter of the series, Bernie Ecclestone, of all the venues in the series Monaco is the one that has the most power to help negotiate a good business deal. It attracts far too many sponsors, adds far too much glamour — the movie stars from the Cannes Film Festival are regular visitors when the two events are scheduled at the same time, as they often are — and has far too much history to consider dropping it in favor of a more lucrative Formula One venue. “It’s full of lovely people, isn’t it?” Symonds said. “Logistically, it is quite difficult. It’s better now that we have the garages, but it is still very cramped, hot, you can’t hear what is going on, etc. But it is a great bit of the show. There are far too many people in Formula One who don’t appreciate the show and the importance of the show, so we need to get on with it.”",

    "source": "A Partnership to Help the Tallest Residents in Yosemite Park <eos> YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. — In an otherworldly grove of cinnamon-colored giant sequoias, workers in June will jackhammer an old mistake: a road and parking lot that impinge on the hallowed forest. The $36 million project, which includes dismantling a gift shop, removing a tourist tram and adding elevated walkways in the grove, will improve visitors’ experiences while better protecting some of the oldest, largest and most beautiful organisms on earth, said Dean Shenk, a supervisory ranger at Yosemite National Park. The National Park Service will contribute about $8 million to the project, and the Federal Highway Administration will spend another $8 million for an improved road to the grove and an expanded parking lot at Yosemite’s southern entrance. The bulk of the cost, $20 million, will be covered by the Yosemite Conservancy , a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco. Philanthropic organizations known for lending a helping hand are funneling millions of dollars into the nation’s major national parks, making infrastructure improvements, building trails and providing volunteers who sometimes perform jobs previously done by park rangers. The National Park Service’s 2014 budget of $2.98 billion is smaller than in any in the last five years, and the agency must absorb federal employees’ raises and rising utility and other costs, said Jonathan B. Jarvis, director of the service. “Because our budget is in decline, we’ve not been able to do the things we feel we should be doing,” he said. The agency oversees 401 national parks, monuments, battlefields, historic sites and other areas, 17 of them added under Presidents Obama and George W. Bush. Meanwhile, the number of park rangers is declining: Last year, there were 4,929 nationwide, down from 5,139 in 2005. Yosemite National Park , which is 180 miles east of the San Francisco Bay Area in the Sierra Nevada, consists of 1,200 square miles of skip-a-heartbeat terrain, including, near its southern entrance, Mariposa Grove, one of the few natural forests of giant sequoia in the world. Don Neubacher, Yosemite superintendent, calls its condition “an embarrassment.” “We just made a lot of mistakes there,” he said. “We didn’t know better.” For generations these towering trees — Sequoiadendron giganteum can grow to more than 250 feet — have endured man’s folly. In the 1800s, they were chopped for shingles, posts, pencils and souvenirs. Tunnels were carved through others for tourist amusement. For 100 years, Yosemite rangers doused fires, before learning that these redwoods — with fire-resistant bark — need fire to punch holes in the forest canopies, clear soil and spread seeds the size of oat flakes. Also harmful, Yosemite added a 115-car parking lot and a road, not recognizing that pavement interferes with the hydrology of the nearly 2,000-year-old trees. “There is the possibility of slow death of some of the trees,” Mr. Neubacher said. Giant sequoias can be planted and thrive elsewhere, but it is only along the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, with its elevation and snowpack, that they naturally regenerate. For nearly 50 years, officials have wanted to return the grove to a more natural state. “If we believe Mariposa Grove is important to save, then we’ve got to look at outside sources,” Mr. Neubacher said. Yosemite National Park and the Yosemite Conservancy have a particularly close relationship. Mike Tollefson became president of the conservancy in 2009 — after retiring as Yosemite superintendent. His organization contributes $5 million to $10 million a year to Yosemite. “We are concerned about these trees if the climate is going to be changing dramatically,” said Sue Beatty, a Yosemite restoration ecologist and deputy project manager, adding that the planned improvements would make the trees more “resilient.” Image The parking lot, a road in the ancient grove and a tram will be removed and a gift shop dismantled. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times By rerouting walkways, tourists will no longer trample meandering 200-foot shallow roots, and by removing the road, the diversion of water from the trees will come to a halt. Some giant sequoias each require an impressive 1,000 gallons of water a day, said Nathan Stephenson, research ecologist with the United States Geological Survey. The newly designed grove, as envisioned by landscape architects paid by the Yosemite Conservancy, is expected to be a quieter and more spiritual place. “We want it to be like you’re entering a cathedral, so you have respect for the trees,” Ms. Beatty said. The problem, she said, “We didn’t have the money to do it.” Yosemite’s budget, which includes federal appropriations, charitable contributions and 80 percent of entrance fees, is $80 million to $90 million annually, down from $100 million in 2009, said Kari Cobb, Yosemite public affairs specialist. Yosemite has adapted to the new fiscal reality. Bathroom cleaning and garbage pickup are done once a day instead of twice, said Scott Gediman, a Yosemite spokesman. Volunteers, supervised by park rangers, remove invasive species, a job formerly done by rangers. At Mariposa Grove, nature walks led by park rangers — which five years ago operated five months a year — are now given only for two and a half months. Mr. Shenk, the park ranger who supervises Mariposa Grove’s interpretive guides, said he teaches visitors about “the great size, great age of these trees.” “And yet they’re surprisingly fragile,” he added. “It’s difficult for them to naturally produce.” Once the pavement is gone, he said, people will see “the majesty of the grove.” The filmmaker Ken Burns, who produced a series of national park documentaries and a short film about Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley, paid for by the Yosemite Conservancy, said, “This is one of my favorite spots in my favorite place on earth.” The grove presents a paradox, he said, “You can feel small next to the giant sequoias in Mariposa Grove, and yet you’re inspirited.” Mr. Burns blamed “an antigovernment movement” for interfering with the mission of the national parks. “People believe government should do just about nothing,” he said. “We think national parks are America’s best idea.” On June 30, 1864, in the midst of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln signed legislation preserving Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley for public use “inalienable for all time.” Photographs of the ancient trees — more than of Yosemite Valley — persuaded the president and members of Congress, none of whom had visited Yosemite, to support the legislation, said Dayton Duncan, co-producer with Mr. Burns of the national park documentaries and the author of a book about Yosemite, “Seed of the Future,” paid for by Yosemite Conservancy. The Yosemite legislation is considered the birth certificate of the national parks concept, which began in the United States and spread worldwide. Not everyone approves of the current public-private partnership. “We’re dodging our national responsibility,” said Alfred Runte, a national parks historian, the author of “Yosemite: The Embattled Wilderness,” and a former Yosemite ranger. “In no way were these friends groups supposed to substitute for uniformed rangers or congressional appropriations,” Mr. Runte said. Well-intentioned volunteers, he said, “are taking away park ranger jobs from educated young men and women.” At other national parks, friends groups also are playing an enlarged role. The Grand Canyon Association restores backcountry trails and renovated the trailhead at Bright Angel Trail, the well-trod path to the canyon, with new bathrooms, seating, shade structure, parking and stone masonry walls. The most successful of these groups, the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy , has donated $300 million to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area since 1981. “Philanthropy has been there from the beginning,” said Greg Moore, executive director of the Golden Gate conservancy. “It seems more important as the system has grown and federal dollars are not growing.”",

    "source": "Officials Fight Donald Trump’s Claims of a Rigged Vote <eos> WASHINGTON — Republican leaders and election officials from both parties on Sunday sought to combat claims by Donald J. Trump that the election is rigged against him, amid signs that Mr. Trump’s contention is eroding confidence in the vote and setting off talk of rebellion among his supporters. In a vivid illustration of how Mr. Trump is shattering American political norms, the Republican nominee is alleging that a conspiracy is underway between the news media and the Democratic Party to commit vast election fraud. He has offered no evidence to support his claim. “The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary — but also at many polling places — SAD,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday . Mr. Trump made the incendiary assertion hours after his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, tried to play down Mr. Trump’s questioning of the fairness of the election. Mr. Pence said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he and Mr. Trump “will absolutely accept the result of the election.” Mr. Trump’s words, though, appear to be having an effect on his supporters, and are setting off deep concern among civil rights groups. According to an Associated Press poll last month, only one-third of Republicans said they had a great deal of confidence their votes would be counted fairly. And election officials are worried that Mr. Trump’s continued pressing of the issue could dampen turnout or cause his supporters to deny the legitimacy of the results if he loses. Last week, Mr. Trump called the presidential election “one big fix” and “one big, ugly lie.” Jon A. Husted, the secretary of state of Ohio, said it was “wrong and engaging in irresponsible rhetoric” for any candidate to question the integrity of elections without evidence. Mr. Husted, a Republican, said he would have no reason to hesitate to certify the results of the election. “We have made it easy to vote and hard to cheat,” Mr. Husted said Sunday in an interview. “We are going to run a good, clean election in Ohio, like we always do.” American elections are, unlike those in many democracies, largely decentralized, rendering the possibility of large-scale fraud extraordinarily unlikely. Further, the balloting in many of the hardest-fought states will be overseen by Republican officials, individuals who would be highly unlikely to consent to helping Mrs. Clinton rig the vote. Chris Ashby, a Republican election lawyer, said Mr. Trump’s attacks on the electoral process were unprecedented and risked creating a fiasco on Election Day. Mr. Ashby also said that Mr. Trump was “destabilizing” the election by encouraging his supporters to deputize themselves as amateur poll monitors, outside the bounds of the law. “That’s going to create a disturbance and, played out in polling places across the country, it has the potential to destabilize the election,” Mr. Ashby said, “which is very, very dangerous.” Mr. Trump’s claims, a little more than three weeks before the election, are once again forcing elected Republicans into a difficult spot as they try to balance offering assurances of the integrity of the election while not undercutting a standard-bearer many of their voters fervently support. “Our secretary of state, Ken Detzner, has been very focused on making sure we have a smooth election,” said Jackie Schutz, a spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, noting that Mr. Scott’s “goal is 100 percent participation and zero percent fraud.” Representatives of other Republican governors offered only a terse “yes” when asked if their state’s balloting would be conducted fairly. Yet other Republicans are appalled at Mr. Trump’s claims of widespread fraud, which are now a staple of his stump speech. “It is so irresponsible because what he’s doing really goes to the heart of our democracy,” said Trey Grayson, a Republican and former secretary of state of Kentucky. “What is great about America is that we change our leaders at the ballot box, not by bullets,” Mr. Grayson said. Still, some of Mr. Trump’s loyal backers are rousing one another with talk of insurrection should Mr. Trump be defeated. In Wisconsin, David A. Clarke Jr., the sheriff of Milwaukee County, posted on Twitter on Saturday that it was “pitchforks and torches time,” along with a photograph of an angry mob wielding weapons. Mr. Clarke addressed the Republican National Convention in July and appears regularly on television as a Trump campaign surrogate. Also, elements of Mr. Trump’s crowds have turned violent. At a rally in North Carolina on Friday, in which he alleged a large-scale conspiracy against him, one supporter lashed out physically at a protester in the crowd. And a CBS affiliate in Virginia reported over the weekend that pro-Trump demonstrators had flashed firearms outside the office of a Democratic congressional candidate near Charlottesville, in a threatening signal. Republicans are also facing signs of menace: A party office in North Carolina was set on fire and spray-painted over the weekend, an act Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter was the act of “animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina.” Still, Mr. Trump’s campaign surrogates have not hesitated to join him in questioning the fairness of the electoral process: Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York, both advisers to Mr. Trump, used TV interviews on Sunday to suggest that Democrats tended to cheat in elections, accusing them of counting votes from dead people. And Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mr. Trump’s closest congressional supporter and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has warned that “they are attempting to rig this election.” Civil rights groups have begun to express alarm at remarks from Mr. Trump that they see as goading his supporters to intimidate minorities at the polls. Arturo Vargas, the executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected Officials Education Fund, said he planned to formally contact the Justice Department as soon as this week, to ask that it guard against the kind of voting disruptions Mr. Trump has encouraged. “It is a major concern that we have this candidate promoting vigilante poll watching,” Mr. Vargas said. And Michael Podhorzer, the political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that progressive groups were deeply concerned about the possibility of disruptions at the polls on Election Day. Mr. Podhorzer said that Mr. Trump’s recent comments about a rigged election had the potential to “incite violence and bloodshed.” Mr. Podhorzer said that Democrats would be closely monitoring polling places for signs of interference in states where voters can cast their ballots before Election Day. “We will start to see whether folks are out intimidating voters in predominantly African-American communities, and at least get a sense of what direction that might be going in,” Mr. Podhorzer said, adding of Mr. Trump’s speech, “This is beyond the pale.” Other Democrats were just as bothered but also amused about the unlikely prospect of a vast fraud plot unfolding at thousands of disparate polling places. “He’s fine with the system when he wins the primary, but now he’s pre-emptively claiming precinct-level fraud?” said Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, calling Mr. Trump’s language “unambiguously racist, but also absurd, ludicrous and pathetic.” Even Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, who just last week all but removed himself from the presidential campaign, was forced to issue a statement. “Our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,” said Mr. Ryan’s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong. Mr. Pence is trying to walk a fine line. The governor, in a series of Sunday television interviews, sought to portray Mr. Trump’s criticism of the electoral process as relating entirely to what he described as unfair news media coverage.",

    "source": "Nothing Fancy in Philadelphia, but Still Hallowed Sports Ground <eos> PHILADELPHIA — Some cities built their ballparks downtown to revitalize sagging neighborhoods. Others constructed them on waterfronts, shimmering palaces against picturesque backdrops. This is not one of those cities. All four of its major professional sports teams play at arenas hard on the edge of South Philly, in a no-frills part of town situated between interstate highways called Sports Complex — emphasis on sports. There are no shops or restaurants in the vicinity, save for stadium establishments and team stores. Food-distribution sites and warehouses rim the eastern edge. A military shipyard frames the southern boundary. The skyline sweeps three miles to the north. Looking for breathtaking scenery? Go elsewhere. No place is better for concentrated action than the intersection of Broad Street and Pattison Avenue, which on Sunday becomes the nexus for a two-sport, all-day battle for Philadelphia-New York supremacy. At 1 p.m., more than 69,000 fans are expected to jam Lincoln Financial Field as the Eagles and Giants renew their longstanding N.F.L. rivalry. At 8:20, about 46,000 will pack Citizens Bank Park, host to Game 4 of the World Series between the Phillies and the Yankees. Give or take a few size 10 Nikes, 428 steps separate the entrances, and a crush of people will undoubtedly mosey across Pattison seeking to take in the double feature, an unwieldy feat if these stadiums were across town from each other. The Sunday forecast called for a partly sunny sky and temperatures in the 50s, making it easy for the fans to layer their jerseys, trading in Donovan McNabb (or Eli Manning) for Jimmy Rollins (or Derek Jeter) come nightfall. No truth, by the way, to the rumor that the Knicks and the 76ers, who played Saturday night at Madison Square Garden, tried to move their game to Sunday at the Wachovia Center to set up a tripleheader. Some parking lots will open as early as 6 a.m. — nothing like a little beer with your morning bagel. The public transit system will supply additional service throughout the day. Football fans have also been urged to carpool and to leave immediately after the game. Despite the acres upon acres of space, parking is apparently limited. Gates and fences carve up the asphalt on the south side of Pattison, but where one lot ends and another begins is indistinguishable. If the Flyers or the 76ers — well, not as much — were playing at the Wachovia Center on Sunday, the streets would be so clogged that fans would be wise to bring a tent and camp out. Actually, some may have thought of that, especially those who said goodbye, once and for all, to the Spectrum. A yearlong farewell tour to the 42-year-old building ended Saturday night with a concert by Pearl Jam, rocking America’s Showplace one final time. Led by Dr. J and Moses Malone, the 1982-83 Sixers, probably the best team ever to play in Philadelphia, called the Spectrum home when they were crowned N.B.A champions. The Broad Street Bullies of the mid-1970s did the same when they won their two Stanley Cup titles, inspired by Kate Smith’s rendition of “God Bless America.” Smith’s statue stands outside the main entrance, and a clip of her performance is still played before important Flyers games. That miraculous shot by Christian Laettner in 1992? It swished at the Spectrum. After the 1995-96 season, the Flyers and the 76ers moved into the gleaming Wachovia Center, which was erected on the site of what was John F. Kennedy Stadium. When the Spectrum is razed next year to clear space for a retail and entertainment project, Citizens Bank Park, which opened in 2004, will be the only remaining stadium to have witnessed a Philadelphia championship — sacred ground. Veterans Stadium, the old eyesore that once stood on the northeast corner of Broad and Pattison, nearly crumbled when the Phillies won the World Series in 1980. It was the site of similarly rare feats in 1996, when the National League won the All-Star Game (the American League has won it every year since), and in 1981, when the Eagles trampled the Dallas Cowboys to advance to their first Super Bowl . A state historical marker stands there now, next to parking lots. In the early afternoon Saturday, as the Flyers played at Wachovia Center, the lots teemed with tailgating fans enjoying the unseasonably warm weather. As one group played whiffle ball in the shadows of the Linc, another tossed a football by the Bank. A flashing sign directed the hockey crowd to one lot, concertgoers to another. Judging by the predominant attire of the fans, they had arrived six hours before first pitch. There was nowhere else for them to go, exactly how they liked it.",

    "source": "2 Old Lighthouses Compete for a Historic Lens <eos> ROCHESTER In the evening, the Rev. Thomas H. Wheeland likes to retreat to the back porch of his rectory at Holy Cross Church and look out onto Lake Ontario, illuminated by a wide beam of light from a neighboring lighthouse. Years have passed since the stone lighthouse, built in 1822, was needed to guide ships into the port of Rochester. Today it is a museum, a beacon to the city’s once-bustling past. “It’s a tremendous asset to the neighborhood and to the whole of this community,” Father Wheeland said. But lately, news that another port is laying claim to an intricate piece of the lighthouse — the soul of it, its lens — has dimmed his spirits. The Fresnel lens in use here takes the light cast by an ordinary bulb and focuses it into a beam visible for up to 15 miles. The city of Lorain, Ohio , nearly 300 miles away, and on Lake Erie, says it is the rightful owner of the lens and has begun a campaign to have it returned. “This has always been on the back of our minds,” said John Malanowski, president of the Lorain Lighthouse Foundation, a group working on the restoration of that city’s historic lighthouse. “Our goal is to restore the Lorain lighthouse and be the ones who bring the lens back.” The lighthouses themselves are joined not only by a lens, but by a similar history. Both were built as their communities harnessed locations on the Great Lakes to become significant shipping outlets. For Lorain, a predominately rural community about 30 miles west of Cleveland, the steel industry led the local economy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the case of Charlotte, a working-class Rochester neighborhood hard by the port, it was the coal trade that dominated the local docks. Both ports started lighting the way for ships centuries ago, with simple lanterns fueled with whale oil or kerosene. When the French physicist Augustin Jean Fresnel (pronounced fra-NELL) invented the lens named after him, in 1822, it was considered a technological breakthrough. The thinner lenses passed more powerful beams farther, greatly increasing shipping safety. Charlotte (pronounced shar-LOT) acquired a Fresnel lens in 1853, Lorain in 1917. Both lighthouses were eventually decommissioned by the United States Coast Guard as they became obsolete. In Charlotte’s case, the waterfront changed, as sediment built up and moved the shoreline away from the lighthouse, and as redevelopment came. Charlotte’s Fresnel lens was moved to another lighthouse and then disappeared. “There are rumors that it fell into the water, but those are not true,” said Fred Amato, president of the Charlotte-Genesee Historical Lighthouse Society. In 1984, the lighthouse here was revived as a museum, the result of an effort to increase tourism and take pride in its historic past. “We wanted a light and went to the Coast Guard, and they came across one,” Mr. Amato said. The Fresnel lens, found in a Coast Guard warehouse in Cleveland, was installed in time for a summer festival that year, Mr. Amato said, that featured tall ships that drew thousands of visitors to the docks. Today, the museum is still a popular summer attraction and a regular stop for tour groups. The problem is that Charlotte’s current Fresnel lens is the one from the Lorain lighthouse, which had become a target for vandals and was on the brink of demolition. In 1987, however, the Port of Lorain Foundation formed and purchased the lighthouse with the goal of restoring it — work that goes on today. Soon, preservationists in Lorain began searching for a Fresnel lens. At one time, the Coast Guard found yet another one, but it was damaged during shipping. This fall, foundation executives in Lorain began a $3 million campaign to raise funds for further restoration and announced their determination to get its original lens back. John Cole, editor of the Lorain paper, The Morning Journal, called Charlotte’s current use of the lens “absurd” in print. “My sense is that the lens belongs in the lighthouse for which it was made,” Mr. Cole said in a subsequent interview. His opinion was brought to the attention of Mr. Amato, who said he was not swayed. A newly made replacement would cost upward of $100,000 — five times the organization’s annual budget — Mr. Amato said. “The lens is ours,” he insisted. “We’ve been maintaining it all this time, and we’ll keep maintaining it.” Robert M. Browning, chief historian for the Coast Guard, said that the lens was on loan to Charlotte until 2011, and that the dispute was not likely to be resolved until then. That both sides are determined to keep the lens does not surprise him, since they are in great demand around the country. “If I had five times as many in our collection, there would still be scores of unhappy lighthouse historians,” Mr. Browing said. “I feel like King Solomon here.”",

Lester (15-8) allowed one run, five hits and two walks, striking out eight to win for the seventh time in nine decisions. It was his 100th career victory. Koji Uehara got five outs for his 20th save. With the crowd standing for most of the final inning, Uehara struck out Brett Lawrie to end the game and the Red Sox poured out of the dugout and bullpen. Dustin Pedroia had three hits for the Red Sox, who have won 19 of their last 25. INDIANS 2, ASTROS 1 Zach McAllister (9-9) lasted five innings and host Cleveland got two unearned runs in a rain-shortened victory that moved them into one of the two A.L. wild-card spots. The game was delayed for 1 hour 9 minutes before the umpires decided to call it after six and half innings. ROYALS 2, RANGERS 1 Neftali Feliz walked Alcides Escobar on four pitches with the bases loaded and two outs in the eighth inning night, giving host Kansas City a victory. TIGERS 12, WHITE SOX 5 Max Scherzer became baseball’s first 20-game winner, pitching through bad weather for six innings to help Detroit to a victory at home. The A.L.

The Pirates appeared in control through eight innings as Francisco Liriano overwhelmed the Reds, allowing two runs and three hits, walking three and striking out seven. Cincinnati scored three unearned runs in the ninth off closer Mark Melancon as shortstop Jordy Mercer threw a routine grounder into the stands. CARDINALS 7, BREWERS 6 Carlos Beltran’s sacrifice fly in the 10th inning scored Kolten Wong to lift visiting St. Louis, which moved into a two-game lead in the N.L. Central. Matt Adams hit his 15th home run for the Cardinals. BRAVES 9, CUBS 5 Chris Johnson went 3 for 4 with a home run as visiting Atlanta reduced its magic number for clinching the National League East title to 1. The Braves scored four runs with two outs in the ninth inning to break open a tie game. Brian McCann and Johnson each had a run-scoring single, and Andrelton Simmons followed with a two-run double. Freddie Freeman earlier hit a three-run homer for Atlanta. David Carpenter (4-1) pitched a scoreless eighth to get the win. Kevin Gregg (2-5) took the loss for the Cubs, who wasted three home runs. Atlanta starter Paul Maholm, twice given a four-run lead, allowed eight hits and four runs in five and a third innings. Chicago’s Scott Baker allowed only four hits in four innings but gave up five runs. NATIONALS 8, MARLINS 0 Jordan Zimmermann (19-8) pitched a two-hitter and earned his N.L.-leading 19th win as host Washington clung to its slim playoff hopes. The Nationals sent 11 batters to the plate in a seven-run sixth against Marlins starter Jacob Turner (3-8) and reliever Chris Hatcher. Denard Span had two hits in the inning, including a two-run triple, and Jayson Werth and Bryce Harper had back-to-back doubles. After hovering near .500 for most of the season, the Nationals, the defending N.L. East champions, have won 29 of 40.

    "source": "Hearst Continues Pursuit of Names of Steroids Users <eos> The Hearst Corporation, which is suing the federal government to reveal the names of dozens of current and former major league baseball players who may have been provided performance-enhancing drugs, filed response papers in federal court yesterday. Hearst argued that the government should reveal to the public the names, which were blacked out in a search warrant, because it has provided a witness, who has the same information, to a third-party investigator. The suit involves the case of Kirk Radomski, a former Mets batboy who admitted to distributing performance-enhancing substances and money laundering. When Radomski pleaded guilty, on April 27, the search warrant executed on his home on Long Island was unsealed, but the names of athletes the government may have evidence he provided drugs to were redacted. Part of Radomski’s plea agreement stated that he must cooperate with George J. Mitchell , baseball’s chief steroid investigator. There has been widespread speculation that his cooperation meant that the government would provide Mitchell with the blacked-out names in the original search-warrant affidavit. When Hearst, which owns 12 newspapers, filed suit in June, it argued that because the government had provided Mitchell, who has no legal standing, with a copy of the affidavit, the public was entitled to the same information. The government, however, said it did not provide Mitchell with an original copy of the affidavit but did say that Radomski had been encouraged to cooperate with Mitchell. The government also said the names should remain sealed because revealing them would inhibit a developing investigation. In its filing yesterday, Hearst said, “Senator Mitchell has been charged by his client with uncovering steroid use in M.L.B. and has pledged to a public report of his findings.” It added, “He has no obligation to the government,” and the government “appears not to have imposed any conditions on Mitchell’s use of those names.” According to Daniel C. Richman, a professor at Columbia Law School, Hearst’s response highlighted the clash between the government’s treatment of Mitchell as a cooperating investigator, and Hearst’s effort to paint Mitchell as a member of the public. “Given the deference usually paid to the government’s investigative concerns, Hearst still has an uphill battle to gain disclosure,” Richman said.",

    "source": "Doctor Being Treated for Ebola in Omaha Dies <eos> WASHINGTON — This time, the challenge of Ebola was much steeper for the doctors and nurses at Nebraska Medical Center , one of a handful of hospitals specially designated to handle cases of the deadly virus in the United States. Unlike the two Ebola patients they had successfully treated earlier this year at the hospital’s biocontainment unit in Omaha, the man who arrived from Sierra Leone on Saturday, Dr. Martin Salia, was in extremely critical condition. Dr. Salia, a legal permanent resident of the United States who had been working as a surgeon in Sierra Leone, died early Monday morning, barely into his second day of treatment, but almost two weeks into his illness. “Even the most modern techniques that we have at our disposal are not enough to help these patients once they reach a critical threshold,” said Dr. Jeffrey P. Gold, chancellor of the University of the Nebraska Medical Center, the hospital’s academic partner. Dr. Philip Smith, the medical director of the biocontainment unit, said that Dr. Salia, 44, had initially been tested for Ebola in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, on Nov. 7, but that the test came back negative. He was retested there on Nov. 10, at which point the results were positive. Dr. Smith said such false negatives were not uncommon early in the illness. Dr. Daniel W. Johnson, a critical care specialist at Nebraska Medical Center, said that Dr. Salia’s kidneys had stopped functioning and that he was laboring to breathe when he arrived at the hospital late Saturday afternoon after a 15-hour flight. Doctors quickly tried two treatments they had used on their other Ebola patients: an experimental antiviral drug and a plasma transfusion from the blood of an Ebola survivor , which researchers believe may provide antibodies against the virus. But Dr. Salia was already so ill that within hours of his arrival at the hospital, he needed continuous dialysis to replace his kidney function. By the pre-dawn hours of Sunday, he was in respiratory failure and needed a ventilator, Dr. Johnson said on Monday. Around the same time, he added, Dr. Salia’s blood pressure plummeted. “He progressed to the point of cardiac arrest, and we weren’t able to get him through this,” Dr. Johnson said at a news conference in Omaha. “We really, really gave it everything we could.” Video Dr. Daniel W. Johnson, the director of critical care at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, discussed how Dr. Martin Salia died after being brought to the hospital with advanced Ebola symptoms. Credit Credit Eric Francis/Getty Images Dr. Smith said he did not know how Dr. Salia had contracted the virus. “He worked in an area where there was a lot of Ebola disease, much of it probably unrecognized,” Dr. Smith said, “and there were many opportunities for him to have contracted it.” In the frenetic neighborhood of Kissy, on the eastern end of Freetown, an eerie quiet hung over the United Methodist Hospital on Monday as news spread that Dr. Salia had died. He was the chief medical officer and the only surgeon at United Methodist Kissy Hospital, according to United Methodist News Service. Leonard Gbloh, the administrator of the hospital, said he did not think Dr. Salia could have contracted Ebola there. “We have not been taking Ebola patients here” he said. “And we had stringent control measures in place to prevent it entering.” The hospital even stopped all surgical work several months ago as a precaution, Mr. Gbloh said. Now, the hospital is being decontaminated and several staff members who came into contact with Dr. Salia after he fell ill are in quarantine there. But Mr. Gbloh said that Dr. Salia — whose wife and two children live in New Carrollton, Md. — had also been working at other hospitals and clinics in the area. He said that Dr. Salia would be remembered as kind and dedicated, adding, “He was a great professional, always willing to work overtime.” Yahya Tunis, a spokesman at the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation, said he had known Dr. Salia well. He recalled how, during a doctors’ strike earlier in the Ebola outbreak, Dr. Salia had turned up at Connaught Hospital in Freetown and persuaded his colleagues to return to work. “He had left the comforts of America to come and work here in his home country,” Mr. Tunis said. “We are very saddened by his passing.” Despite signs that Ebola is in decline in eastern parts of Sierra Leone, as well as in neighboring Liberia, the virus is still rampant in Freetown and its environs. According the government’s count, the country saw more than 500 new cases last week, with the highest number in Freetown. Five other doctors in Sierra Leone have contracted Ebola; all have died. Although the State Department arranged for Dr. Salia’s travel to Omaha from Sierra Leone on a specially equipped plane, patients or their sponsoring organizations are typically responsible for the costs of such evacuations. Dr. Salia is the second patient to die of Ebola in the United States. The first, Thomas Eric Duncan , died in early October at a Dallas hospital after traveling there from Liberia. Two nurses who cared for Mr. Duncan, Nina Pham and Amber Joy Vinson , also contracted the virus but recovered. Two other Americans who contracted Ebola in West Africa, Dr. Rick Sacra, a missionary doctor, and Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance cameraman, recovered after being treated at the Nebraska unit in September and October. But both arrived there earlier in their illness and did not need dialysis or a ventilator. Each patient at the Nebraska unit has received a different experimental drug, and doctors say it is hard to know whether they helped Dr. Sacra and Mr. Mukpo. Dr. Salia’s body will be cremated, Dr. Smith said, adding that he and his staff are still waiting for the results of Dr. Salia’s blood tests, which will show how much virus he had in his body. Dr. Smith said the nurses, doctors and respiratory therapists who had cared for Dr. Salia would monitor their temperatures and be on alert for any symptoms of the virus in the coming weeks, logging the results into an electronic database that will be checked daily. But they will continue to work, he said. “The staff gave it everything and then some,” said Rosanna Morris, the hospital’s chief nursing officer. “Now they need a little time to grieve and really find peace within themselves, awaiting our next patient.”",

    "source": "South Sudan Cease-Fire Proves to Be Short-Lived <eos> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — An agreement for a cease-fire in South Sudan that was signed Friday barely made it into the new week before violence resumed in the seething conflict that has already left thousands dead and displaced more than 1.3 million people. A previous pact, signed in January, also failed almost immediately . As early as Monday, South Sudan’s minister of defense, Kuol Manyang, said there had been new fighting in Upper Nile State. On Wednesday, the government and the rebels accused each other of violating the short-lived accord. In an interview from Juba, South Sudan’s capital, Ateny Wek Ateny, a spokesman for President Salva Kiir, said the government had been attacked by the rebels, led by Riek Machar, the former vice president under Mr. Kiir. Yohanis Musa Pouk, a spokesman for Mr. Machar, asserted that Mr. Kiir had violated the cease-fire to avoid the establishment of an interim government and elections that might leave him out of power. He called the cease-fire a good agreement, “but we know that the government won’t honor it.” “Nobody will talk about elections if there is insecurity in the country,” Mr. Pouk said. Sunday Okello Angoma, a researcher on South Sudan at the Institute for Peace and Security Studies at Addis Ababa University, said, “The two sides don’t seem to be ready to implement any peace agreement.” Mr. Angoma said that Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar seem to make cease-fire agreements fairly easily. Putting them into effect is something else. The civil war has so disrupted the fragile country, which became independent of Sudan only in 2011, that United Nations agencies warned last month of famine without a major relief effort. Mr. Angoma urged the establishment of an international peacekeeping force large enough to keep order. A South Sudanese research organization stimulated the debate over an interim government with a proposal published over the weekend and sent to negotiators in Addis Ababa. “The mission is to lay the foundation for sustained peace, economic growth, poverty reduction and the structure for resilient institutions,” said Lual Deng, the managing director of the research organization, the Ebony Center for Strategic Studies in South Sudan and, until 2011, a minister in the Sudanese government. The proposal suggested a collegiate presidency of five individuals who would rotate every six months. The presidency would have a representative from each of South Sudan’s three chief regions — Greater Bahr el Ghazal, Greater Equatoria and Greater Upper Nile — a representative from the army, and a woman. Mr. Deng said that by putting an emphasis on the regions, the arrangement could avoid ethnic dominance by either Mr. Kiir’s Dinka ethnic group, or the Nuer, which largely supports Mr. Machar. Longstanding tensions between those groups burst into open warfare last December after Mr. Kiir accused Mr. Machar of plotting to overthrow him . The proposal also suggests a cabinet of technocrats. Mr. Deng said that the interim government would be installed, without elections, after Mr. Kiir’s term that officially ends next year. Mr. Pouk said Mr. Machar’s delegation had not seen the proposal but was working on its own plan. Mr. Ateny opposed the idea of installing five individuals who were not elected to lead the country. “President Kiir is the one to head South Sudan until people decide to vote him out,” he said.",

    "source": "John Edwards Loses Bid to Get Campaign Finance Case Dismissed <eos> GREENSBORO, N.C. — A federal judge on Thursday rejected former Senator John Edwards ’s request to dismiss criminal campaign finance charges against him, all but ensuring that Mr. Edwards will go to trial in January. The ruling, by Judge Catherine C. Eagles of United States District Court here, came after a full day of arguments on Wednesday. “After all these years, I finally get my day in court,” Mr. Edwards said as he left the courtroom Thursday morning. “I never for a second believed I violated campaign laws.” Mr. Edwards, the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee, has been charged with violating finance laws to hide an extramarital affair during his 2008 presidential campaign. Abbe Lowell, a powerhouse Washington criminal defense lawyer who recently joined Mr. Edwards’s legal team, spent much of the hearing arguing that the government’s case was vindictive, politically motivated and based on an overly broad definition of campaign contributions. Prosecutors countered that the case was straightforward. Mr. Edwards solicited the money and used it, in effect, to try to influence the outcome of the 2008 campaign, they said. If convicted, Mr. Edwards faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines. The nearly $1 million in question came from two wealthy supporters who provided cash, travel and living expenses for a campaign videographer, Rielle Hunter, with whom Mr. Edwards fathered a child, and a former campaign aide, Andrew Young, and his family. Mr. Young, who for a time claimed to be the child’s father, is expected to be a star witness for the prosecution when Mr. Edwards goes to trial. Lawyers for Mr. Edwards argued Wednesday that the money was never a campaign contribution. Rather it was a gift, they said, that Rachel Mellon, a 101-year-old banking heiress, and the late Fred Baron, Mr. Edwards’s national campaign finance chairman, gave to help Mr. Edwards. In a legal twist in the case, Mr. Young is scheduled to answer contempt of court charges in a hearing next month related to his behavior in a civil case winding its way through state court in North Carolina. That case centers on a sex tape purported to feature Mr. Edwards and Ms. Hunter and several photographs that may include images of Mr. Edwards and the daughter he had with Ms. Hunter, who was born in 2008. Ms. Hunter claims Mr. Young stole the material from her. Mr. Edwards and Ms. Hunter have given depositions in the case. Records in the sex-tape case have been sealed, but federal prosecutors investigating Mr. Edwards issued a subpoena ordering Mr. Young to turn over thousands of pages of documents. In Mr. Edwards’s bid to get the charges dropped, his lawyers claimed Wednesday that the government conducted an overly elaborate investigation and spent a disproportionate amount of resources investigating the charges at the behest of the United States attorney at the time, George Holding, a Republican appointee of President George W. Bush who stayed on after the Democrats took the White House in 2008 to finish the Edwards case. Judge Eagles rejected arguments that Mr. Holding, who has supported Mr. Edward’s political opponents, pursued the case to further his political ambitions. Mr. Holding, who has since left the Justice Department, recently announced he is running for Congress.",

    "source": "Jay Z Reveals Plans for Tidal, a Streaming Music Service <eos> As Jay Z sees it, there is a clear solution to the problems facing musicians in the streaming age. They should band together — behind him, of course. On Monday, Jay Z, the rap star and entertainment mogul, announced his plans for Tidal , a subscription streaming service he recently bought for $56 million. Facing competition from Spotify, Google and other companies that will soon include Apple, Tidal will be fashioned as a home for high-fidelity audio and exclusive content. But perhaps the most notable part of Jay Z’s strategy is that a majority of the company will be owned by artists. The move may bring financial benefits for those involved, but it is also powerfully symbolic in a business where musicians have seldom had direct control over how their work is consumed. “This is a platform that’s owned by artists,” Jay Z said in an interview last week as he prepared for the news conference announcing the service. “We are treating these people that really care about the music with the utmost respect.” The plan was unveiled on Monday at a brief but highly choreographed news conference in Manhattan, where Jay Z stood alongside more than a dozen musicians identified as Tidal’s owners. They included Rihanna, Kanye West, Madonna, Nicki Minaj, Jack White, Alicia Keys, the country singer Jason Aldean, the French dance duo Daft Punk (in signature robot costumes), members of Arcade Fire, and Beyoncé, Jay Z’s wife. The stars stood side-by-side and signed an unspecified “declaration.” Jay Z did not speak, but Ms. Keys read a statement expressing the musicians’ wish “to forever change the course of music history.” Jay Z’s plan is the latest entry in an escalating battle over streaming music, which has become the industry’s fastest-growing revenue source but has also drawn criticism for its economic model. Major record labels, as well as artists like Taylor Swift, have also openly challenged the so-called freemium model advocated by Spotify, which offers free access to music as a way to lure customers to paying subscriptions. Tidal, which makes millions of songs and thousands of high-definition videos available in 31 countries, will have no free version. Instead, it will have two subscription tiers defined by audio quality: $10 a month for a compressed format (the standard on most digital outlets) and $20 for CD-quality streams. “The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value,” said Jay Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter. “Water is free. Music is $6 but no one wants to pay for music. You should drink free water from the tap — it’s a beautiful thing. And if you want to hear the most beautiful song, then support the artist.” As a superstar artist and influential executive through his company Roc Nation, Jay Z has unusual power in the music industry. He is said to be courting new artists aggressively to join the service and offer Tidal special material and “windows,” or limited periods of exclusive availability. Yet Jay Z is entering the streaming fray as a boutique competitor against some of the most powerful companies in the business. Spotify has 60 million users around the world, 15 million of whom pay; Apple is expected to introduce a subscription streaming service this year. Last fall, Tidal’s parent company, the Swedish technology firm Aspiro, said it had 512,000 paying users. In addition, the broader market for streaming music includes YouTube and the Internet radio giant Pandora. Tidal faces other hurdles, like whether Jay Z can attract artists from beyond his inner circle. And while Tidal may have the support of individual artists, in many cases the distribution rights to their music are controlled by record companies. Lucian Grainge, the chairman of the Universal Music Group, said he welcomed Tidal’s arrival. “We like lots of services and we like lots of competition,” Mr. Grainge said. “Jay is an artist as well as an entrepreneur. He’s a winner, and we like winners.” Speaking by phone from Los Angeles — where he was periodically interrupted by parenting duties for his 3-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy — Jay Z described his vision for Tidal as an outlet where musicians and fans “can all just camp out and listen to music,” and where artists would “always be on album cycle,” meaning in constant promotion mode. Music executives briefed on his plans were more prosaic, calling it a hub for entertainment content and social media. Other ideas, like links for concert tickets and merchandise sales, have been discussed as possibilities. Vania Schlogel, a Tidal executive, said that a majority of the shares in the service would be set aside for artists. She and Jay Z declined to reveal specifics about the equity deals. But one executive involved in the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deals were private, said that participating artists were being granted shares in exchange for their good-faith efforts to supply exclusive content — a sign, perhaps, of the confidence that the artists and their managers have in Jay Z’s ability to get things done. In describing the service, Jay Z emphasized the question of fair play for musicians, calling the current system “criminal.” “Everyone knows that the pay system is unfair to artists,” he said. “Everywhere else, everyone gets compensated for their work. Music is everywhere — you consume it every day, everywhere you go. The content creator should be compensated. It’s only fair.” Like other streaming services, Tidal pays a small royalty each time a song is listened to. Ms. Schlogel declined to comment on the company’s rates other than that they would be higher than services that have free tiers supported by advertising. Last fall, Ms. Swift sent shock waves through the music business when she withdrew her music from Spotify, apparently because she did not want it offered free. About a month later, Jay Z approached the board of Aspiro, according to an Aspiro disclosure. Jay Z dismissed a suggestion that his interest had been prompted by Ms. Swift’s move, saying that his plans “have been in the works for a year.” Jonathan Prince, a spokesman for Spotify, said in response to a question about competition from Tidal, that “we think it’s good for artists and labels to be on Spotify, because that’s where the music fans are, and we are confident that’s where artists and labels will want to be.” Early Monday, artists associated with Tidal began promoting the service on social media through the tag #TIDALforALL . That stirred excitement among fans, although some in the music business and the technology world remain skeptical about Tidal’s chances against players like Apple and Spotify. “I think Jay Z is about to find out the limits of his celebrity,” said David Pakman, a venture capitalist and former digital music executive. “I am sure he will lure exclusive content onto the service but that will reach a limited audience.” Jay Z said he was not concerned about the competition as long as he was able to put forth the service that he has envisioned. “I just want to be an alternative,” Jay Z said. “They don’t have to lose for me to win.”",

    "source": "Basketball 101, Through Jaded-Colored Glasses <eos> Dan McGrath is a columnist for the Chicago News Cooperative. I thought of Rus Bradburd last weekend while watching West Virginia and Kentucky play for a berth in the N.C.A.A. tournament’s Final Four. West Virginia’s coach, Bob Huggins, once went four years with a zero graduation rate and had 21 players turn up on city police blotters when he coached at Cincinnati. Kentucky’s coach, John Calipari, reached the Final Four twice previously with Massachusetts and Memphis, but both appearances were vacated because of N.C.A.A. infractions. They’re two of the most prominent and highly paid figures in college basketball. The coach-turned-writer Rus Bradburd has a healthier sense of the game than either of them. He speaks with self-deprecating candor when he observes that basketball has been pretty good to him ... since he quit trying to play it. From his seat far down the bench on two of North Park College’s three consecutive Division III national championship teams in the late 1970s, Bradburd decided he was “the worst player in North Park history.” But that debatable opinion didn’t diminish the love of the game he developed as a ball-handling savant on Chicago playgrounds. So he went into coaching, and spent 14 years as a top-level assistant to Don Haskins at Texas-El Paso and Lou Henson at New Mexico State, both Hall of Famers. Over time, though, the demands of the job and the direction of the game led to a disillusionment that Bradburd began to articulate as he pursued a master’s in fine arts at New Mexico State. His transition from jaded basketball lifer to accomplished author has resulted in two highly provocative, critically acclaimed books that use the sport for illuminating character studies: Bradburd’s own in “Paddy on the Hardwood” and Nolan Richardson’s in “Forty Minutes of Hell.” Where “Paddy”is a sweet, engaging recapitulation of the two years Bradburd spent coaching what passes for pro ball in Ireland, “Forty Minutes” is a sharp-elbowed biography of Coach Richardson, whose crash-and-burn departure from Arkansas in 2002 overshadowed 17 years of heady success, including a national championship. Black coaches’ struggles for acceptance, in a game that black players have long dominated, gives the book a strong historical underpinning. “I’ve always been drawn to stories,” Bradburd said in an interview from New Mexico State, where he teaches writing. His own story is also one worth telling. Bradburd, 50, literally wrote his way into coaching the college game — he sent letters to every college coach he could think of in 1982, after one year as coach at Von Steuben High School, his alma mater. Fate delivered him to Haskins at Texas-El Paso. “Even then, I must have been a better writer than I was a coach,” Bradburd said. “I’d never been to El Paso and didn’t know anybody there. That letter got me hired sight unseen.” Haskins made history in 1966 (Texas-El Paso was then Texas Western) when his team with five black starters beat Adolph Rupp’s all-white Kentucky squad for the N.C.A.A. championship. Nolan Richardson played for Haskins. So did Tim Hardaway, partly as a result of Bradburd’s Chicago connections. A point guard from Carver High School with big-time talent and Chicago-bred toughness, Hardaway was a standout at Texas-El Paso and a five-time N.B.A. all-star after the Golden State Warriors picked him in the first round of the 1989 draft. “For the rest of my time in coaching, I was known as the guy who recruited Tim Hardaway,” Bradburd said. “You could do worse.” Bradburd’s coaching these days is pretty much limited to Basketball in the Barrio, the name of the camp he runs for El Paso youngsters each summer that blends basketball drills with cultural enrichment. He hasn’t owned a television for 20 years but keeps up with his sports friends via the Internet. One of them is Tim Floyd, a colleague on Haskins’s staff who returned to Texas-El Paso this week four jobs after he was Jerry Krause’s ill-fated choice to coach the post-dynasty Bulls in 1998. “I begged Tim not to take that job,” Bradburd said. “I said, ‘What can you do that Phil Jackson didn’t do?’ He said, ‘Rus, it’s $1.5 million a year.’ I said, ‘You’re making $750,000 in Ames, Iowa — how much do you need? Is it worth it to double your salary and commit career suicide?’ ” Floyd’s run with the Bulls ended badly — he was pushed out the door on Christmas Day 2001 after two and a half desultory seasons. He wasn’t the first coach and certainly not the last to follow the money, but Bradburd sees the practice as symptomatic of the corrupting influence that money exerts on sports at almost every level. “There’s a certain self-importance that occurs when there’s so much money involved,” he said. “We were about to play Fullerton State one year when I was at New Mexico State. One of their players was shot and left paralyzed, and there was talk of canceling the game. We’re wondering: ‘Can they do that? How will it affect their mental state? Would we be better off playing them now or later?’ “A kid was shot, and we sounded like the most insensitive jerks in the world talking about what it meant to us. We were not. We were just caught up in our own little world where winning basketball games was what mattered more than anything.” The game Rus Bradburd studied from the North Park bench has changed, almost beyond recognition. He’s more comfortable writing about it than living it. It’s a better way to express his love.",

Mayberry tied it off Steve Cishek in the 10th after Juan Pierre scored on a wild pitch in the top of the inning. In the 11th, an error by pitcher Edgar Olmos (0-1) and two walks loaded the bases for Mayberry, who lined a homer to left. Mayberry became the first Phillies player to hit a game-ending grand slam since Dale Murphy against the Chicago Cubs on Aug. 6, 1991. “Sometimes with John, if you can get him with certain pitchers, that’s when he becomes much better,” Philadelphia Manager Charlie Manuel said. “Sometimes, when he comes off the bench — I wouldn’t call him a great pinch-hitter — but when he goes into the game and he gets some time in the game, the next at-bat, he becomes much better.” ROCKIES 5, REDS 4 Troy Tulowitzki hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning — after the umpires initially ruled fan interference — and visiting Colorado ended a six-game losing streak against Cincinnati.

    "source": "Serena Williams-Angelique Kerber Final Is Grand Slam Rematch <eos> WIMBLEDON, England — It did not take long in the least, and as soon as Serena Williams had thrashed Elena Vesnina, 6-2, 6-0, in well under an hour, it was clear that the Wimbledon final on Saturday was going to be a rematch. Either Serena was going to play her older sister Venus in another Grand Slam final or Serena was going to play Angelique Kerber in another Grand Slam final. It turned out to be Kerber, which is a disappointment for all sentimentalists who wanted one more all-Williams final on a major occasion, but which is frankly for the best. From Serena’s perspective, beating your sibling could never feel as good as beating that left-handed German upstart who absorbed your superior power and spoiled your evening in the Australian Open final back in January. With Steffi Graf’s Open-era record of 22 Grand Slam singles titles still on the line, it seems more fitting that Serena gets to swing away with no mixed emotions. And swing away she will against Kerber, who is much closer to the shy Graf personally than Serena. “I feel the real Serena is back,” her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, said on Thursday as he walked to Court 2 to watch the Williamses win their quarterfinal doubles match. Lack of self-assurance is not a Mouratoglou trademark, although his back story as the son of a wealthy and demanding French father is certainly complex. He has been upbeat before other big matches in the past year and has been proven wrong when Serena’s all-conquering form turned out to be a facade. Cracks have been visible in the last month as well. First in the final of the French Open, where she was beaten by Garbiñe Muguruza, and again in the second round here at the All England Club, where she was nearly beaten by the unseeded American Christina McHale. But there has been very little for a coach to complain about since that rain delay against Svetlana Kuznetsova at 5-5 in the first set in the fourth round. The Centre Court roof was closed. Mouratoglou, a smooth talker with a true passion for the game, found the words to calm Serena’s nerves, and she has since been on a rumble indoors and outdoors. Thursday’s outdoor display against Vesnina was reminiscent of her display on this same patch of grass against another Russian with roots in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. She was Maria Sharapova, whom Serena used for a designer punching bag in the gold medal match at the 2012 London Olympics. Final score: 6-0, 6-1. Serena has never played better tennis from start to finish in a tournament than she did at the All England Club during those Games, and it was a big part of her late-career revival. “I went on the court with a game plan,” said Vesnina, a 29-year-old making her debut at this high-pressure level. “I think I tried everything. I serve and volley a couple of times. But it was just not meant to be today. It was all about Serena.” Kerber offers the possibility of a broader plotline and, better yet, something resembling a rivalry, which women’s tennis has long needed. It has been 10 years since two women met in two Grand Slam singles finals in the same calendar year: Amélie Mauresmo beat Justine Henin to win the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2006. None of this is Serena’s fault. She has endured and excelled, becoming one of the greatest female athletes of all time. “I prefer the word, ‘One of the greatest athletes of all time,’” she said Thursday during a news conference in which she took several stands for gender equality. Kerber is one of the best movers and counterpunchers in the game and is particularly fit. Her left-handedness has been an advantage on grass (consider the nine-time Wimbledon singles champion Martina Navratilova and, more recently, the two-time champion Petra Kvitova). In this year’s Australian Open final – her first major final – Kerber was able to reboot rallies and return serves with a rare aplomb. None of Serena’s first six opponents in Melbourne put more than 70 percent of her serves back in play. Kerber did so 81 percent of the time as Serena, the most imposing server in the history of the women’s game, had an off night by her standards and was then memorably gracious in defeat. Venus, the family’s other big server, had an off day of her own on Thursday. Kerber put 85 percent of her returns into play in what was very likely the 36-year-old Venus’s last chance at reaching a Wimbledon final. She often lacked rhythm and leg drive and was broken in her first four service games, winning just 57 percent of the points on her first serve in the match. Those are not winning grass-court numbers, but Kerber was plenty edgy herself in phases of her 6-4, 6-4 victory, twice starting games with two double faults. How much better will she have to play to give Serena a run on Saturday? “She definitely has to play better than that,” said David Witt, Venus’s coach. “You can’t give Serena one free point a game, much less two double faults, and expect to hold.” Serena will clearly attempt to pounce on Kerber’s weakness: her second serve. Although Kerber is adept at defending an aggressive return with her quick feet and squat shots, it is trickier to do so on grass, where the bounce is lower and not quite as true, than on a medium-speed Australian hardcourt. “If Serena gets that first strike, it’s much tougher to defend on this surface than any other surface,” said Tracy Austin, the former No. 1 working as a BBC analyst. “That being said, it’s a slower surface than it was 10 years ago.” Austin, like most pundits, is picking Serena to end her recent Grand Slam title drought. It is the logical choice based on the weight of shot, but there is also the weight of the occasion. Twenty-two has not been Serena’s lucky number, with her upset losses to Roberta Vinci in the semifinals of last year’s United States Open and her defeats against Kerber and Muguruza this year. Asked what it would mean to equal Graf’s mark, Serena put up her formidable defenses. “My goal has never been 22,” she said. “I don’t talk about that anymore.” Mouratoglou was more nuanced. “We don’t think about that,” he said. “With what happened the last 10 months, it’s about winning a Slam, not about winning No. 22. It’s about finding the real Serena again. That’s the point. That’s what’s important.” This all sounds like a fine attempt to deflect the focus until Serena actually wins No. 22 and then sinks to her knees and begins talking about the weight that is finally off her shoulders. “She’ll get there,” Witt said. “It’s just a matter of time.” But isn’t it more compelling for all involved that she gets to play a grudge match to chase it at Wimbledon?",

    "source": "Skakel Loses in Effort to Gain a New Trial <eos> STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 25 — Michael C. Skakel , who was convicted five years ago of killing a neighbor, Martha Moxley , in 1975 when they were both teenagers in Greenwich, suffered a further setback on Thursday when a state judge denied his bid for a new trial. The judge, Edward R. Karazin Jr. of Stamford Superior Court, concluded that newly discovered evidence suggesting an alternate theory of the homicide would not have produced a different outcome at trial. The lawyers for Mr. Skakel, 47, who is serving a term of 20 years to life, said they intended to appeal the decision and challenge his confinement on the ground that he had ineffective counsel at his trial. While that line of appeal is often considered a last resort, Judge Karazin’s ruling might make that argument easier because of his findings that Mr. Skakel’s trial lawyer, Mickey Sherman, could have discovered some of the evidence now in question if he had pursued it more diligently. The evidence, developed with the help of Mr. Skakel’s prominent cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer, included videotaped testimony from Gitano Bryant, an acquaintance of Ms. Moxley, about how he accompanied two friends of his from the Bronx to Belle Haven, the gated community where the Moxleys and the Skakels lived, on the night she was bludgeoned to death with a golf club. Mr. Bryant testified that his two friends boasted at the time of wanting to attack a girl “cave man style” and later gloated that they had. The threesome, according to Mr. Bryant, also handled golf clubs they found on the Skakel property. The judge wrote that although Mr. Bryant’s account would meet the threshold to be admissible, “it lacks credibility, and therefore would not produce a different result in a new trial.” Ms. Moxley’s brother, John Moxley, called the decision expected, and added: “But still it’s a relief. It’s official.” Mr. Moxley said he never believed the theory that the two visitors from the Bronx were responsible for his sister’s death because Mr. Bryant “was a very well-known person, and he’s not the kind of person who could have been there that night with all those people running around and no one would have known who he was.” He said the alternative account was “like a bad movie script,” and added: “This blames the three black guys coming in off the highway. It’s just too far-fetched.” Mr. Sherman, for his part, said he expected an attack on his competence from Mr. Skakel’s new lawyers, Hope C. Seeley and Hubert J. Santos. “If Hope had not done it, she would have been accused of malpractice,” he said. He added: “I said on the witness stand that if they lose that motion, I become the enemy and get thrown under the bus. It’s the nature of the beast.”",

    "source": "Selig's Next Problem: Bonds's Landmark Homers <eos> IN campaigning for a more stringent steroids-testing program and prodding the players union to accept it, Commissioner Bud Selig stressed the need to restore baseball's integrity. Some of us were skeptical that baseball had an integrity problem, pointing to record attendance and increased interest as evidence that fans didn't really care about steroids. But with more than a little help from Congress, his argument prevailed. So let us take Selig's position for a moment, that steroids created an integrity problem for baseball. He may feel he has fixed the general problem, but Selig knows baseball faces a specific problem, a huge one, in the coming months. He won't talk about it, declined to as recently as yesterday, but it has a name: Barry Bonds. Supposedly recovered from a series of knee operations that limited him to 14 games and 5 home runs last season, Bonds will begin the season on April 3 needing only six home runs to match Babe Ruth's total of 714 and 47 to catch the career leader, Henry Aaron, and his 755. When Bonds surpasses both totals, which he will unless he falls down an open manhole, Selig, other officials and fans won't know how to greet him and his record. Did he achieve it honestly, or by cheating? Rafael Palmeiro was dumb or desperate or naïve or just plain careless in using steroids, and was caught last year. Mark McGwire stonewalled Congress and will find out in 11 months if his refusal to answer steroids questions will block his path to the Hall of Fame. Bonds has never tested positive for illegal substances, and he has always denied using them. Furthermore, he began his home-run binge before baseball tested for steroids. The San Francisco Chronicle reported in December 2004 that Bonds testified to a federal grand jury investigating a Bay Area steroids lab that he had used two substances supplied by his personal trainer. According to the reported transcript of his testimony, Bonds said he was told the substances were flaxseed oil and a rubbing balm for arthritis, but the government identified them as undetectable steroids, \"the clear\" and \"the cream.\" Kimberly Bell, who said she had a nine-year relationship with Bonds, said in an interview with The New York Times last year that Bonds told her he used steroids. She has testified twice before the federal grand jury in San Francisco, most recently last month. She declined, through her lawyer, Martin Garbus, to say yesterday what she told the grand jury. Bonds has raised questions himself with the remarkable increase in his offensive production at ages that most players experience declining output. After never having hit more than 49 home runs, he slugged a record 73 in 2001, a year in which he turned 37. Nobody knows if illegal substances have aided Bonds -- no one has produced public evidence of it -- but this is what the commissioner would like to know before he and the rest of baseball salute Bonds as the game's greatest home run hitter. If baseball's integrity hangs on Bonds's next 48 home runs, the only way to find out if he has had help is to conduct an investigation. Some, including the union, would find an investigation distasteful, but if the commissioner is genuinely concerned about the integrity of the game, he has to determine if the 214 home runs Bonds has hit in the past five years have been genuine. The ideal man for such an investigation would be John Dowd, the aggressive Washington lawyer whose investigation into Pete Rose's betting led to his banishment. If Selig wanted to investigate Bonds, however, he wouldn't ask Dowd to do it. They aren't on friendly terms. Dowd upset the commissioner's office several years ago with a television interview in which he discussed the Rose case. The commissioner's office said Dowd had violated lawyer-client privilege and filed a bar complaint against him. But Dowd argued that confidentiality wasn't involved, and the D.C. bar association dismissed the complaint. \"I've never been popular up there,\" Dowd said recently. Nevertheless, Dowd said an investigation into Bonds and steroids was \"a very good idea.\" \"I think they're going to have a raging fight about it,\" he said in a telephone interview, \" because so many people are upset at steroids and don't think the home runs are deserved. It's all about the integrity of the game.\" At least Selig and Dowd agree on that point. How should an investigation be conducted? \"They'll have to get the same evidence the U.S. attorney did in San Francisco,\" Dowd said, referring to the steroid lab case. \"It's going to be hard because time has passed. They'd have to look at a lot of film to check his size, talk to his teammates, talk to some of the guys who appeared before the House committee. \"It's kind of like the Rose case. You have to go back and recreate what happened, talk to trainers and staff. Talk to Bonds. I don't know if anyone ever asked him.\" Selig couldn't discipline Bonds if past use of steroids were discovered, but that would not be the point of an investigation. If baseball has an integrity problem, Selig should want to do everything he can to eradicate it.",

    "source": "ISIS Operative From Australia Is Killed in Iraq Airstrike, Officials Say <eos> SYDNEY, Australia — An Australian who had recruited for the Islamic State in the Middle East and urged fellow Australians to commit terrorist attacks at home has been killed in an American airstrike in Iraq, officials said on Thursday. Neil Prakash, whom the attorney general, George Brandis, called the most dangerous Australian involved with the extremist group, was killed in the city of Mosul on April 29, Mr. Brandis said. Mr. Prakash had “appeared in ISIL propaganda videos and magazines and has actively recruited Australian men, women and children, and encouraged acts of terrorism,” Mr. Brandis said in a statement, using an alternate term for the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS. About 110 Australians overseas are believed to be fighting for the Islamic State or actively supporting the group, according to the Australian government, which is part of the United States-led effort to fight the extremists. Mr. Prakash left Australia in 2013 and had been based mostly in the Syrian city of Raqqa, officials said. Australian officials have linked Mr. Prakash, who also used the name Abu Khaled al-Cambodi, to a number of failed terrorist plots here, including a purported plan to attack police officers in April 2015 during celebrations for the Anzac Day holiday , which honors Australian and New Zealand veterans of World War I. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in an interview with Sky News that Mr. Prakash “has been a target for some time, as he should have been.” Mr. Brandis said another Australian, Shadi Jabar Khalil Mohammad, and her Sudanese husband, Abu Sa’ad al-Sudani, had been killed in a separate United States airstrike near Al Bab, Syria, on April 22. Both recruited foreign fighters for the Islamic State, Mr. Brandis said. Ms. Mohammad was the sister of Farhad Mohammad, 15, an Australian boy who shot and killed a civilian police employee, Curtis Cheng , outside a police station in suburban Sydney in October. The boy was then shot dead by police.",

    "source": "Napolitano Focuses on Immigration Enforcement <eos> EL PASO — A day after President Obama announced that legislation to overhaul immigration laws would have to wait until next year, the secretary of homeland security played down the need for change in a speech here and took a tough stance on enforcing current immigration laws. The secretary, Janet Napolitano , defended the administration’s assertive strategy against illegal immigrants and companies that employ them, relying largely on programs started under President George W. Bush. That strategy has drawn fire from immigrant groups and many of Mr. Obama’s Hispanic supporters, who say the president has not lived up to campaign promises to ease the pressure on illegal workers and to seek changes in immigration laws that would give more workers visas. But Ms. Napolitano argued that the Obama administration had changed Mr. Bush’s programs in critical ways, such as putting an emphasis on deporting criminals and holding more employers responsible for hiring illegal workers. “Make no mistake, our overall approach is very, very different,” she said Tuesday at a conference on border security at the University of Texas, El Paso . “It is more strategic, more cooperative, more multilateral and, in the long run, more effective.” Ms. Napolitano said security problems on the border were inextricably linked not only to the drug trade, but also to the problem of illegal workers in far-flung cities across the country. The government needs to address illegal immigration at the same time it attacks the Mexican mafias, she said. Her remarks disappointed advocates for immigrants, who questioned whether increasing enforcement would improve security as much as overhauling immigration laws would. “How many more millions if not billions of dollars are we going to put into the border without fixing the immigration system?” asked Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum. Joshua Hoyt, executive director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights , said of Ms. Napolitano, “She’s increasing enforcement of laws that President Obama and she have both said are broken, and the result is going to be a lot of human misery.” Ms. Napolitano and other administration officials have argued that a tough stance on illegal immigration is necessary to convince American voters to accept a wider overhaul that would give legal status to millions of foreigners. Still, the speech was notable for its lack of a single passage about the positive role many illegal immigrants play in society, a concession that has become standard in most political pronouncements from Democrats on the subject. Ms. Napolitano pointed to the buildup of federal agents on the border as part of the fight against drug dealers, saying the nation must take advantage of a historic level of cooperation with Mexico under President Felipe Calderón to stamp out organized crime. This year, she said, the government has seized more than $69 million in drug money, 2.4 million pounds of drugs, 95,000 rounds of ammunition and about 500 assault rifles, far more than last year. “But border security will not itself stop illegal entrants into our country,” Ms. Napolitano said. “Our border strategy must be combined with better enforcement of the immigration laws within the United States.” On that score, she pointed out that the Obama administration had outdone the Bush White House. Immigration agents have arrested 181,000 illegal immigrants and deported 215,000 people so far this year. Both figures are double what they were for the same period two years ago, she said. But Ms. Napolitano said she had shifted the emphasis away from arresting immigrants who have not broken other laws.",

    "source": "Look at Assessor Race. Isn’t Democracy Grand? <eos> Joe Berrios is two-legged evidence that the greatest outrages in politics tend to involve what’s absolutely legal. This enduring truth suggests why the Chicago electorate, having set a record in the Feb. 2 primary for its worst turnout, might actually be roused to vote in the November election for the confounding, mystery-shrouded post of Cook County assessor. Mr. Berrios is a former state representative and a multitasking phenomenon worthy of a course at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy Studies. He’s the Cook County Democratic chairman, a lobbyist for the Illinois Coin Machine Operators Association and Illinois Licensed Beverage Association and the longest-serving member of the important, anonymous, incestuous Cook County Board of Review. Like the assessor’s office, which sets our property tax rates, the board is so enveloped in complexity that its inscrutability ensures a lack of accountability. The chance that any local journalist has covered one of its meetings is about the same as his covering the august South Cook County Mosquito Abatement District. But the board is critical to corporate Chicago and the lucrative commercial real- estate tax appeals practices of certain law firms, including that of Michael Madigan, speaker of the Illinois House. It’s where you appeal the assessor’s decisions. It’s partly why Mr. Berrios and Mr. Madigan are worthy of a Discovery Channel special: the first pair of Hispanic-Irish conjoined twins attached at the checkbook. Mr. Berrios lobbies Mr. Madigan on legislation, while Mr. Madigan appeals to Mr. Berrios for tax relief for clients — saving them many millions of dollars. The two men can make political donations to each other, just like litigants before the board can contribute to Mr. Berrios’s campaigns and Springfield lobbyists can enrich Mr. Madigan. And the duo can plot in political tandem since Mr. Madigan runs the state Democratic Party while Mr. Berrios runs the county party apparatus. Isn’t democracy grand? Mr. Berrios spent part of his youth living in the awful, defunct Cabrini-Green housing project. He’s now a Horatio Alger hero, Chicago-style, faithful servant of coin operators, Anheuser-Busch and high-rise developers avoiding a fair share of taxes. Mr. Berrios won the Democratic primary for assessor but is aghast that Forrest Claypool has announced an independent candidacy. Mr. Claypool is the reform-minded Democratic Cook County commissioner who served Mayor Richard M. Daley (twice) as chief of staff — as have enough others to fill the United Center — and head of the Park District. He’s also close to two Chicagoans working in the White House, namely President Obama and David Axelrod. He might be County Board president now if then-Senator Obama hadn’t been too coy by half and waited until the day before the 2006 primary to back him. Mr. Berrios says that Mr. Claypool should have run in the primary and that to the victor goes the spoils. Such a rationale did not prevail when party honchos showed the exit to Scott Lee Cohen, the pawnbroker who won the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor. Mr. Claypool needs 25,000 valid signatures by June 21 to get on the ballot, then a lot of free publicity and some luck. As important as the assessor’s post is, it’s not one to galvanize voters, especially in a year when an awful economy, high unemployment and the imminent trial of an impeached Democratic governor are all there to suppress interest. So he’ll have to educate us and get our apathetic selves to the polls. He needs to explain how the system is broken; why the assessed values of our homes seem to bear little link to their market value; how the heck the infamous “multiplier” works in calculating values, and why good intentions won’t be undermined by the review board. Representative Mike Quigley, an ally of Mr. Claypool, cites the “bully pulpit” aspect of the job, including pressing for change, like putting online the results, justifications and attorneys of record for all appeals. But I’d also love to know why assessor is even an elected position. “Good question,” Mr. Claypool said. He then argued that the post is so influential, and can do such damage in the wrong hands, there needs to be political accountability. Cross your fingers and hope for a re-invention. Just imagine somebody pressing to eliminate donations to review board members by the people who practice before it. That’s probably do-gooder dreaming. It’s more realistic to hope that if Mr. Berrios does win, he’ll at least invite us all over to headquarters for free licensed beverages and video poker.",

    "source": "Long Island Transit Modes Recording Fewer Commuters to Manhattan <eos> FOR years, Andrew Bernstein and his neighbors could never find seats together on crowded Long Island Rail Road trains. During the last year, however, those seats have become easier to find. As the number of L.I.R.R. commuters has fallen, Mr. Bernstein, 49, can sit with friends when he makes the trip from his home in Hicksville to his accounting job in Manhattan. While that may make for a more enjoyable ride, commuters say there is an eerie quality to the newfound space on the train, the likes of which Mr. Bernstein said he could not remember in the last decade except under extraordinary circumstances. “The last time I saw this was after 9/11,” he said. “It’s probably as bad today as it was then.” Mr. Bernstein’s experience is not unique, nor is it limited to railroad commuters. According to transportation officials, the number of commuters using trains, buses, roads and bridges that serve Long Island is down by as much as 7 percent — a phenomenon they say is most likely tied to higher unemployment that has grounded would-be commuters at home. “A lot of it is related to the downturn in the economy,” said Aaron Donovan, spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the L.I.R.R.; bridges like the Throgs Neck, Whitestone and Robert F. Kennedy (formerly the Triborough); and Long Island Bus, which serves Nassau County. Mr. Donovan said that area roads and mass transit experienced similar declines during other tough economic times, like the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. According to Metropolitan Transportation Authority figures, the number of Long Island Rail Road riders in January was down 4 percent from January 2008. What makes that drop even more significant is that in 2008, the L.I.R.R., the busiest commuter railroad in the country, had the greatest number of passengers, 87.4 million, in its history, Mr. Donovan said. That was a 1.5 percent increase over 2007. The decrease in ridership comes as the M.T.A. faces a growing budget shortfall, has proposed service cuts and is seeking more state aid. However, fewer commuters is hardly the primary cause of the M.T.A.’s financial woes, Mr. Donovan said. “Generally speaking, lower volumes on the roads and trains and buses and on our bridges and tunnels contribute to the weaknesses in the M.T.A.’s revenue,” he said. But the real problem, he said, stems from lower revenue from real estate transfer taxes that are dedicated to the M.T.A. “Those taxes are tied to the health of the economy,” he said, “and those revenues are down more than 50 percent so far this year.” The amount of traffic on roadways has dropped even more than train ridership has, the authority said. Traffic on M.T.A. bridges and tunnels fell 7.3 percent during the period from January 2008 to January 2009. The average number of weekday Long Island Bus riders fell 7.6 percent, Mr. Donovan said. The number of cars traveling the Long Island Expressway, among the most closely monitored roads in the state, has dropped as well, according to State Department of Transportation traffic counts. The average daily traffic on the L.I.E. in 2008 was down 1.93 percent from 2007. Though periodic dips in traffic can be pegged to a range of causes — road construction, high gas prices and alternative routes — Department of Transportation officials believe the current decline is more likely tied to the economy, particularly because it has persisted after other problems, like last year’s high gas prices, have subsided, said Eileen W. Peters, a department spokeswoman. The premise that fewer jobs means fewer commuters is based not only on the decline in traffic counts but also in the long-term analysis of commuter patterns. Trips to and from work account for 30 percent of travel, meaning a significant percentage of road and transit use is reduced when unemployed workers stay home, said Jeffrey M. Zupan, who, as a senior fellow for transportation at the New York City-based Regional Plan Association, studies traffic and transit-related issues in the metropolitan area. Travel is further reduced when unemployment runs high because people who are not working are less likely to drive to activities like shopping or entertainment, he said. In addition, it is not unusual for a transit agency like the L.I.R.R., which serves primarily commuters, to be hit somewhat harder in tough times than those that serve a wider range of travelers, Mr. Zupan said. For example, M.T.A. figures show that Metro-North Railroad ridership in January 2009 dipped only 1.8 percent from the previous year — a smaller decrease than the one experienced by the L.I.R.R. That difference, however, jibes with previous studies that show Metro-North serves riders traveling to and from New York City for a wide range of reasons, compared with the heavier commuter orientation of the L.I.R.R., Mr. Zupan said. “Long Islanders tend to use the railroad less for nonwork purposes than Metro-North riders,” he said. “Metro-North has surveyed their customers recently and issued reports about the fact that they are not just a commuter railroad anymore.” Meantime, travelers say they have mixed feelings about the newfound ease of their trips. Chris Olsen, 26, a Manhattan resident who travels to Farmingdale for work, said the smaller crowds on L.I.R.R. trains is a topic among his colleagues at their company, which provides staff for other companies. He said they see the decline in commuters as a sign of today’s tough times. Caroline Bock, 46, a graduate student who lives in Old Bethpage and drives to City College of New York in Upper Manhattan every Wednesday, said her trip — which includes the L.I.E. and the Cross Island Parkway, goes over the Throgs Neck Bridge and winds up on the Cross Bronx Expressway — has shortened drastically, from as long as an hour and a half to as little as 45 minutes. While there are fewer cars on the road, Ms. Bock said she had also noticed a smaller number of trucks, which she said did not bode well for the economy. “It probably means that there are less goods and less sales going on out there,” she said. “Whoever thought less traffic would be worrisome?”",

(AP) — A North Carolina laboratory has stopped doing research and is surrendering all of its animals a week after an undercover video showed what activists allege were workers cruelly treating dogs, cats and rabbits, federal regulators said Wednesday. Dave Sacks, a United States Department of Agriculture spokesman, said officials were trying to find new homes for more than 200 animals that were at Professional Laboratory and Research Services Inc. He said it was the company’s decision to stop research. The agency has started a formal investigation. The developments came after People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released a video of conditions at the laboratory. The company’s phone number at the lab in Corapeake, near the Virginia line, was disconnected Wednesday. Helen Sonenshine, the company president, did not immediately return a call seeking comment, but previously said she was appalled by the video. The laboratory was hired by pharmaceutical firms to test animal care products. Agriculture Department inspection reports show no sign of violations before the PETA video. One scene of the video, according to PETA’s account, shows an employee letting a cat grasp a fence with its claw before yanking it in an apparent attempt to rip off its nails. PETA contends that workers also sprayed the animals with harsh chemicals, lifted rabbits by their ears and puppies by their throats, and violently threw cats into their cages.",

    "source": "Alderson Considers Best Way to Flesh Out Mets’ Rotation <eos> LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — As baseball’s annual winter meetings kicked into gear Monday, the Mets were busy working on complementary deals that would fill out their roster. Sandy Alderson, the no-longer-impoverished general manager, had three or four more needs to address, some trade chips available and roughly $10 million to $12 million to spend. He said that he had been so busy that he missed Sunday night’s episode of “Homeland.” “So don’t say anything, O.K.?” he added. He was more serious discussing, in vague terms, what he might do next. He had already accomplished a good deal, adding the free-agent outfielders Chris Young and Curtis Granderson at a likely cost of $23 million on the 2014 payroll. His No. 1 need seems to be finding a veteran starting pitcher who is not very expensive and could help fill out a rotation that has Zack Wheeler, Dillon Gee and Jon Niese but will be without Matt Harvey until 2015. Alderson said he would be hesitant to give a free-agent starting pitcher a multiyear deal, only because he expected his two top pitching prospects, Noah Syndergaard and Rafael Montero, to be ready to join the major league rotation sooner rather than later. He said he would prefer not to bring either up until midseason, following the formula he followed with Harvey in 2012 and Wheeler in 2013, but indicated he might not have the luxury to be that patient. “Ideally, we’d like to ease guys in,” Alderson said. “But these may not be ideal times.” Another option for the rotation is Jenrry Mejia, who Alderson said will compete for a spot in spring training. Mejia has been an elusive prospect for the Mets because of a series of arm injuries, one of which required Tommy John elbow surgery. Indeed, Alderson said he wondered if Mejia could stay healthy for a sustained period. Last season, Mejia joined the rotation in the second half and pitched effectively in five starts, with a 2.70 earned run average, but then was shut down to have surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow. He is still only 24. In addition, Alderson has met with a representative for Bartolo Colon, who is 16 years older than Mejia. But Colon, almost defying logic, went 18-6 for Oakland in 2013, with a 2.65 E.R.A. in 30 starts. He may be looking for more money than the Mets want to pay him. Another potential candidate, Bronson Arroyo, has proved to be remarkably durable for Cincinnati during the past eight seasons. But at 36, he is seeking a multiyear deal perhaps worth close to $10 million a year, which is also probably too rich for the Mets, even if they did just give Granderson $60 million over four years. It might make the most sense for Alderson to take a flier on a pitcher such as Daisuke Matsuzaka or Johan Santana. Matsuzaka allowed just four runs in his final four starts for the Mets last season after being acquired almost as an afterthought. However, Alderson said, there have been no discussions aimed at bringing back Matsuzaka. Santana, battered by injuries, has not pitched in two of the past three seasons and is finally off the Mets’ payroll. But would Alderson bring him back at an extremely reduced rate? Wait and see, Alderson said. Until that time, there’s that episode of “Homeland” he would like to take a peek at.",

    "source": "Language of Greek Crisis Shifts From Financial Jargon to Humiliation <eos> BERLIN — Greece’s financial crisis has often been framed in the dry, impersonal language of finance. At issue were credit ratings, bond yields and repayment schedules. The pulse of a collapsing nation was often measured in technical jargon about borrowing costs and primary surpluses. Now, with Greece and its European creditors locked in bitter negotiations this week over the terms of the country’s bailout, the politesse of the talks has disintegrated into starkly personal terms. Now the language of the Greek crisis is about humiliation, national pride, moral hazard and hypocrisy. Most ominously, it has deteriorated into a blunt confrontation between Greece and its biggest creditor, Germany, inflaming public opinion in both countries and reviving recriminations over who owes whom — always a risky exercise on a continent that has not forgotten the horrors of two world wars or the conflicts of centuries before. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece used a speech before Parliament on Tuesday to renew a call for Germany to pay reparations to Greece for the crimes and unpaid debts of the Nazis, and his government threatened to seize German assets in Greece. Berlin responded firmly, insisting that the reparations issue is long settled, and the German news media reacted angrily. “If one takes Athens seriously, then Greece itself, which is so proud of Alexander the Great, would have to fear demands for historical injustice,” Reinhard Müller wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The nationalistic antagonism has added an ugly new dimension of populist brinkmanship to an economic crisis that still threatens to fracture the European Union. Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the escalating exchanges risked hardening popular attitudes in Germany and emboldening other populist parties, from the left-wing Podemos in Spain to the right-wing National Front in France. “The euro was meant to bring Europeans closer together and to strengthen political union,” Mr. Leonard said, but the Greek-German clash has led to a “scary return to civilizational language — national stereotypes, hatred, lack of trust.” “The closer you bind Germany and Greece together,” he said, “the more hostility there is.” The quarrel may be most vivid in the apparently poisonous relationship between the finance ministers, Wolfgang Schäuble of Germany and Yanis Varoufakis of Greece. Many Greeks see the caustic Mr. Schäuble, 72, as the flinty embodiment of a German austerity policy they blame for destroying their country. Many Germans, by contrast, see Mr. Varoufakis, 53, as the swaggering embodiment of an unrepentant Greece trying to shirk its obligations. The rising mutual contempt is not limited to them. The Greek defense minister, Panos Kammenos, threatened this week that if Germany did not support Greece in the debt talks, Greece would send to Berlin the thousands of illegal migrants who have landed in Greece on rickety boats from Africa in recent months. One of Germany’s police unions responded by calling for Greece to be ejected from the zone of 26 countries in Europe where citizens can cross borders freely without visas. It has been clear since Mr. Tsipras and his left-wing Syriza party won power in late January that Greece would take a more confrontational approach in trying to renegotiate the terms of the country’s bailout, worth 240 billion euros ($255 billion). Mr. Tsipras appealed to Greek nationalism during the campaign. He vowed to force the country’s three main creditors — the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank — to write off half of Greece’s debts, and to reinstate thousands of public employees who were fired to meet the creditors’ budget demands. Since taking office, though, Mr. Tsipras has been forced to backtrack on many of his promises, even as he framed a four-month extension to the bailout as a political victory. Image The German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, center, at a meeting last month. The verbal sparring between him and his Greek counterpart, Yanis Varoufakis, has become a public sport. Credit Emmanuel Dunand/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Now, with Greece rapidly running out of money and the European creditors demanding additional action from Athens before they release more loan money, Mr. Tsipras has chosen to revive the question of war reparations. “The best way to deal with the issue would be by taking legal action, but they decided to politicize the issue,” said Theodore A. Couloumbis, professor emeritus of international relations at the University of Athens, adding that Mr. Tsipras may have decided to do so to distract domestic attention. “It is embarrassing for a government that came to power on a promise to reverse austerity — and with rhetoric describing Greece as a debt colony and lenders as loan sharks — to backtrack,” Mr. Couloumbis added. “There is a sense among Greeks that they are sick and tired of being told what to do by Merkel and Schäuble, and so they should push their claims. Why not?” The previous Greek government, a center-right coalition, completed a study of the reparations issue in March 2013, but it was not made public until last Sunday. According to an Athens newspaper, the study concluded that Germany may owe Greece over €30 billion ($32 billion). While the verbal sparring between Mr. Varoufakis and Mr. Schäuble has become a public sport, the historical antagonism it has revived is serious. Mr. Varoufakis set the tone in February during his first trip to Germany as finance minister, when he used a joint news conference to remind Germans that Greece’s economic troubles had helped fuel the rise of a neofascist party, Golden Dawn, and to draw a parallel with the rise of Nazism in the 1930s. “No one can understand better than Germany how a suffering economy, with certain humiliations and a great loss of hope, what effects that can have,” Mr. Varoufakis said, as Mr. Schäuble sat nearby. “We need Germany at our side; we need the support of Germany.” The outrage felt by some German conservatives toward Greece began to boil over on Feb. 27, when the German Parliament approved a four-month extension to the Greek bailout after a heated debate. “Look at Tsipras, look at Varoufakis,” said one member, Klaus Peter Willsch, in a speech before the vote. “Would you buy a used car from them? When your answer is no, then vote no today.” The revival of claims from World War II has dredged up ghosts supposedly laid to rest by Europe’s postwar pursuit of peace, unity and common policies. The hardships inflicted by German-led demands for austerity have prompted angry outbursts of political populism and widened a chasm of historical interpretations. For instance, in arguing that Greece should be forgiven its current debts, some in Athens and their supporters cite the 1953 London conference where Germany’s postwar creditors effectively forgave West Berlin about half its external debt — some 15 billion deutsche marks, equivalent to about 10 percent of West Germany’s gross domestic product in 1953, according to a study by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Berlin. The Germans point to the same conference to argue that the reparations issue is settled. Under the London agreement, which eventually involved 18 foreign creditors, final reparations were to be settled when Germany was reunited, which happened in 1990. At that time, the Germans say, they received no claim from Greece for any more than the 115 million marks paid in the 1970s. “This chapter is, for us, legally and politically closed,” Steffen Seibert, the German government spokesman, said Wednesday. Still, reports this week that the Greek justice minister, Nikos Paraskevopoulos, was considering signing an order to seize German property in Greece drove some German news outlets into a frenzy. “Enough!” screamed the Bild Zeitung, the country’s most widely read daily newspaper. “That’s what you want to shout to the Greek government. Day after day, hour by hour come new thrusts from Athens. Bizarre, arrogant, unabashed.” There was only one conclusion, the newspaper said: “It’s moral blackmail.”",

    "source": "A Haggadah for the Digital Age <eos> The Haggadah, the book Jews have been reading for centuries as they celebrate Passover at the Seder, the festival meal, is getting a high-tech makeover from Bronfman Associates, which markets books by Edgar M. Bronfman, the businessman and philanthropist who died in December. Bronfman Associates has commissioned a new app for “ The Bronfman Haggadah ,” a 128-page, hardcover book published in February 2013 by Rizzoli that was written by Mr. Bronfman and illustrated by his wife, the artist Jan Aronson. The app is being advertised in a new campaign that is, not surprisingly, digital. Described by Rizzoli as a “contemporary Haggadah,” “The Bronfman Haggadah” retells the Exodus story of slavery and freedom through Mr. Bronfman’s words as well as through the words of the poet Marge Piercy, the author Ralph Waldo Emerson and the abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Watercolor illustrations, both abstract and figurative, by Ms. Aronson depict symbolic foods consumed during Passover, the parting of the Red Sea, and Moses receiving the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, among other rituals and events. The book retails for $29.95, while the app, which went on sale earlier this month, costs $9. Created by the web design firm RustyBrick, based in West Nyack, N.Y., the app features narration by male and female actors; performances of songs traditionally sung at Passover, whose lyrics appear in the hard-bound book; a glossary of words transliterated from Hebrew to English; and video interviews with Mr. Bronfman and Ms. Aronson. Ms. Aronson said her husband, who served as the chairman of the Seagram Company and president of the World Jewish Congress, had wanted “to write something on his own that would address the issues he was profoundly interested in, Passover, the Seder, being Jewish.” Ms. Aronson called the app version of the book “the next natural progression.” “We are in the 21st century and we don’t move without a device,” she added. Image The cover of the book, which was published in 2013 by Rizzoli. The advertising campaign for the app, by Appular, a New York-based mobile app marketing and public relations agency, began on Friday and will continue through April 15; the budget for the campaign is under $100,000. Ads, which are digital banners, cleverly play upon language traditionally spoken at Seders: One says “The Bronfman Haggadah” “makes this Seder different from all others,” while another says it “makes this night different from all others.” Others ads say, “Like Seder night itself, our Haggadah is a little different,” and “Take an Exodus from the traditional Seder.” The app is being advertised on Facebook and Google, as well as on the websites of Kveller, My Jewish Learning, Tablet Magazine, The Jewish Week and Beliefnet. Amalyah Oren, a communications associate at Bronfman Associates, said the app might be used by families as a learning tool to help prepare for Seder. She said the advertising campaign was directed at families and young mothers, as well as young professionals interested in technology or involved with mainstream and progressive Jewish movements. Ms. Aronson said Mr. Bronfman wrote the Haggadah “to appeal to all kinds of Jews, believers and nonbelievers, to the young who might not have a sense of their own Judaism. Edgar had a tremendous love and regard for youth of every stripe. He found with the tremendous assimilation happening today, it’s always a good thing to bring back into the fold those who may have lapsed or may feel unaffiliated. Edgar wanted to appeal to everybody and to be very open.” Ms. Aronson said she hoped people would buy both the app and the hard-bound book, so they could have “a slightly different experience with the content and context. They can bring it to the Seder table and read it to children; they don’t have to read it just at Passover. I don’t think one excludes the enjoyment of the other; each enhances the other.” Mr. Bronfman’s other books included memoirs on his life as a businessman and on his personal Jewish development, as well as a book on reinventing oneself after retirement.",

    "source": "Sarkozy Reshuffles His Cabinet <eos> PARIS — President Nicolas Sarkozy called together his new cabinet Wednesday after a ministerial shake-up, urging them to push on with his ambitious legislative program. Mr. Sarkozy announced late Tuesday the reshuffle, his second since being elected in 2007. In total, nine ministers changed jobs, eight new names entered government and eight others were cut. The changes were more wide-ranging than expected, although Prime Minister François Fillon stays in his job and incumbents were not shifted from the crucial international and financial posts of economy: budget, environment, foreign affairs and defense. Luc Chatel, Mr. Sarkozy’s spokesman, who moved from industry to become education minister, said Wednesday that the president “really urged them to be reformers, as it’s on this basis that the French people will judge us.” The combination of the reshuffle and a keynote speech Monday by Mr. Sarkozy appear to signal a subtle reordering of priorities toward the social and economic, and away from the institutional, said Denis Muzet, director of Médiascope, a Paris-based institute specializing in social and political trends. During the speech in Versailles, seen as a mid-course relaunching of his five-year term, Mr. Sarkozy laid out priorities including overhauling a costly pension system and investing in infrastructure and research, while pledging to keep taxes stable and extend unemployment protection. Mr. Sarkozy repeatedly used words like “future,” “us” and “open” in an attempt to be inclusive. Mr. Muzet said that speech and the reshuffle gave the sense that there was “less of an obsession with following the 2007 promises and more in addressing the problems that this crisis has thrown up” — in other words, stressing social, economic and environment issues. Still, Mr. Sarkozy is not abandoning campaign pledges. He is midway through programs to bring more private-sector forces to health and education, while shaking up the legal profession, including plans to abolish the system of investigating magistrates. Among the most important changes in the reshuffle were the move from the Interior Ministry to the Justice Ministry of Michèle Alliot-Marie, a defense minister under former President Jacques Chirac. Mrs. Alliot-Marie will replace Rachida Dati, who leaves the government to become a European lawmaker. Ms. Dati, criticized for an overly glamorous image, leaves behind a tricky dossier, including overhauling the country’s crowded prisons. Brice Hortefeux, a longtime ally of Mr. Sarkozy, who had been labor and social affairs minister, was named to the Interior Ministry, replacing Mrs. Alliot-Marie. Mr. Hortefeux was also elected to the European Parliament last month but will remain in the cabinet. He said Wednesday that Mr. Sarkozy had told the new team to be “prudent” in their public comments. Mr. Muzet, the analyst, said the new cabinet continued Mr. Sarkozy’s reputation for being inclusive. The most symbolic change was the appointment as culture minister of the author, director and television presenter Frédéric Mitterrand, an open homosexual and the nephew of the former Socialist president François Mitterrand. Mr. Mitterrand, who had been head of the Rome branch of the Alliance France cultural organization, announced his appointment Tuesday before the official government announcement. He had been involved in the radical left movement before supporting Mr. Chirac’s presidency in 1995. Mr. Sarkozy has previously brought in high-profile personalities from the left, including Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, who remains in his post. The strategy is seen by analysts as a tool to trip up critics and further weaken the left. He also brought Michel Mercier, a former treasurer of the centrist MoDem party, to the post of rural affairs minister, and appointed some young officials like Benoist Apparu, 39, who becomes housing minister. The government now has only 4 women among the 18 ministers, down from 7 in the previous cabinet; there are 9 more junior female secretaries of state, making a total of 13 women in the full government team of 38. Mr. Mitterrand replaces Christine Albanel, who will leave the government in what is seen as punishment for mishandling the first run through Parliament of a bill to crack down on illegal downloads. Mr. Chatel, a close ally of Mr Sarkozy, inherits the difficult education dossier. This year, university students and staff protested, paralyzing many campuses to force the withdrawal of unpopular laws giving university chiefs more power. Another minister leaving to become a European parliamentarian is Michel Barnier. He is replaced at agriculture by Bruno Le Maire, who had been minister for European affairs. That post is filled by a Pierre Lellouche, who had been an envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Bernard Laporte, the former trainer of the French rugby team, leaves the government. His post will be taken by Rama Yade, 32, a telegenic woman of African origin.",

    "source": "N.H.L. Cancels Another Week of Games <eos> The N.H.L. wiped out the third week of the regular season Friday as the lockout dragged on, leaving no more wiggle room if the league hopes to play a full 82-game schedule. A day after the league turned down three counterproposals from the players union, the N.H.L. canceled 53 more games. A total of 135 games through Nov. 1 have been scratched, which amounts to 11 percent of the season. In its third lockout since 1994, the N.H.L. is sticking to its most recent proposal that stated a full schedule, with 82 games per team and 4 rounds of playoffs, could be played if the season began by Nov. 2. The league has said a deal must be reached with the union by next Thursday for that to happen. Two weeks ago the league called off 82 games from Oct. 11 to 24. On Thursday the union rejected the N.H.L.’s proposal made two days earlier that offered a 50-50 split of hockey-related revenues. In brief talks the players countered with three offers that were, in turn, quickly dismissed by the league. Commissioner Gary Bettman said he was “thoroughly disappointed” as he and the league delegation left union headquarters in Toronto. Bettman said that the owners’ proposal was the “best that we could do” and added that the sides were still far apart. “None of the three variations of player share that they gave us even began to approach 50-50, either at all or for some long period of time,” Bettman said Thursday. “It’s clear we’re not speaking the same language.” No new talks are scheduled. If next Thursday’s deadline passes, more games will probably be cut, and the Winter Classic on Jan. 1 is the next big event in danger of being lost. The Detroit Red Wings are scheduled to host the Toronto Maple Leafs in the outdoor extravaganza at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor. Donald Fehr , the executive director of the union, said two of the players’ proposals would have the players take a fixed amount of revenue, which would turn into an approximate 50-50 split over the term of the deal, provided league revenues continued to grow. The third approach would be a 50-50 split, as long as the league honored all existing contracts at full value. None of it made any positive impression on the N.H.L. “This is not a good day,” Fehr said Thursday. “It should have been.”",

    "source": "Bowden Adjusts to His Life as a Dadgum Retiree <eos> TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Bobby Bowden still lives in the cream-colored brick house he and his wife, Ann, fell in love with in 1976. There was a pool out back, a golf course beyond that and, in the front yard, a sprawling oak tree that canopied the driveway. Its limbs were so big and low that Bowden could walk up them. The Bowdens loved that tree. Then, about 10 years ago, it started dying and had to be cut down. Looking out his front window on a recent afternoon, Bowden grimaced and shook his head. It had to have been 10 years ago. He was not exactly sure. He is 84 dadgum years old, mind you. And to think, four years ago, he was coaching at Florida State. He was aging and the program was foundering, but he wanted to stay one more year. He was told he could stick around, but his title would be something like ambassador coach and he would not be allowed on the field. He rejected the idea and was essentially forced into retirement. Life after Bowden turned out just fine for Florida State. Jimbo Fisher, in his fourth year, coached the Seminoles to an undefeated regular season and a spot in the national championship game, the team’s first appearance since 2001. Fisher’s quarterback, Jameis Winston, won the Heisman Trophy. Asked how he was enjoying life after Florida State, Bowden leaned back in a chair in his home office and let out a loud, familiar laugh. Image Bobby Bowden was carried off the field after beating Florida, 37-9, in 1977. Credit Associated Press At first, he had feared becoming irrelevant once he stopped coaching. Now he is a public speaker in high demand. He travels the country, sometimes by private plane, speaking to corporations, churches and athletes about two or three times a week. He tells football stories and quotes Scripture. People ask about his two championship teams and his two Heisman-winning quarterbacks, Charlie Ward and Chris Weinke. When he is not traveling, he hangs around the house. He usually wakes up about 4 a.m., feeds the cat, has a cup of coffee and starts to read. First, he reads the Bible, maybe just a chapter, and then skims through about 10 books. Then he reads his local newspaper and checks his mail. It can take him hours to autograph all the things people send. His address and number are in the phone book. He tries to sign everything because he thinks he owes the fans. He would not want anyone to think poorly of Bobby Bowden. When he is finished, he watches television. He starts with the Military Channel and, if the program is not about a war he is interested in, he flips to Animal Planet, and if there are no lions, tigers, cheetahs or animals like that, he tunes in to ESPN. He and Ann go to dinner around 4:30 to beat the crowd, somewhere nearby, maybe to a Chinese restaurant or Applebee’s. Then Bowden is asleep by 8. He loves this quiet life. Sometimes, he sits and reads under the magnolia tree in the backyard, or makes himself peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches, his favorite, or hits a few golf balls by himself at the country club behind his house. Most Saturdays, at 8:45 a.m., Bowden golfs with a friend, Randy Ray, a pastor at North Florida Baptist Church. Bowden has Type 2 diabetes and watches his diet, but the exercise helps. Plus, he and Ray have a friendly rivalry. Bowden keeps both his and Ray’s scores in his head and pokes fun when he is ahead. He usually wins. “Coach,” Ray once said to him, “I’ll be glad when you start slipping a little bit.” Bowden, in his backyard, says as he looks at the course: “I finished college and the next year was a college coach. I coached for 57 years without being off. So then I retire — a weight’s lifted off your shoulders. All of a sudden, I don’t have to worry about the players going to class. I don’t have to worry about, ‘Did they get in trouble?’ I don’t have to worry about a 2 o’clock phone call from the police. I don’t have to worry about recruiting. It was just a relief, boy!” Image Bowden and his wife, Ann, greet members of the Seminoles’ 1993 national title team in 2013. Credit Phil Sears/Associated Press He laughed louder now. Each Saturday after golf, he makes sure to watch Florida State. Fisher is like a son to him. Bowden has known him since he was in college. You see, Bowden said, his son Terry convinced Fisher to leave Clemson, where he had gone to play baseball, to play quarterback for Terry at Salem College in West Virginia. Terry ran his father’s Florida State offense and studied his team’s film each week. The offense was imaginative, designed to set defenses up, then hit them with the big play, the trick play. Running it required a smart, precise, disciplined signal-caller. And Fisher was his son’s first handpicked quarterback. He came to summer workouts with his football shoes covered in manure and hay from working on his family’s farm. He starred at Salem, then followed Terry to Samford College, in Birmingham, Ala., where he was named the Division III national player of the year. Terry hired Fisher as an assistant, and Fisher coached under him for about 11 years, first at Samford, then at Auburn. Fisher was teaching Bobby Bowden’s offense to Terry Bowden’s quarterbacks. It kept evolving, but the principles remained. “All those years,” Terry said, “he was always kind of part of the family.” Midway through the 1998 season, Terry Bowden resigned at Auburn and went into broadcasting. Fisher continued his rise. He worked at Cincinnati for a season, then went to Louisiana State and saw Nick Saban’s process firsthand. A few years later, after the 2006 season, Bobby Bowden was in need of an offensive coordinator, preferably one who knew quarterbacks. Not since Weinke left in 2001 had Bowden had an elite quarterback. His son recommended hiring Fisher. “We know Jimbo,” Terry Bowden said he told his father. “We know what he can do.” Bowden picked Fisher and turned the offense over to him, which perhaps marked the end of his era at Florida State. After the 2009 season, during which Bowden turned 80, he wanted to stay for one more year. He wanted to reach 400 wins. Then he wanted Mickey Andrews, his longtime defensive coordinator, to succeed him. Instead, the administration forced him out and promoted Fisher. Video The legendary coach talks about his departure from F.S.U., life after football and the coming season. At the time, Bowden was upset. For the next few years, he stayed away from Florida State, out of the spotlight, not out of spite, but to stay out of Fisher’s way. He wanted to give Fisher room to establish himself, his own program, free of distractions. It so happened that, as Fisher and Winston and Florida State made their spectacular run this season, Bowden returned for the first time since he retired. On Oct. 26, Florida State celebrated Bobby Bowden Day. The marching band spelled out “Dadgum,” his favorite expression, and he planted Chief Osceola’s spear at midfield. “I’ve had all that I need,” Bowden said as he smiled and played with the big F.S.U. ring that Burt Reynolds gave him years ago. He said he was fine now that he did not get that extra year. He does not miss coaching. In a few years, he and Ann might move to Panama City, Fla., to be closer to their children. It is amazing what Fisher has done, Bowden said, hiring the right assistants and competing with Southeastern Conference teams for blue-chip recruits. It will become more difficult from here on because, as Bowden said, “Once you win a national championship, they expect you to do it every year.” “Every year!” he said with a wink. In a phone interview, Terry Bowden, who now coaches at Akron, pointed out a clear pattern: “My daddy won two national championships with two Heisman Trophy quarterbacks,” he said. “It takes that one extra — whether it’s a Cam Newton, or Jameis Winston, or whoever. It takes that one little thing to put you over the top.” The elder Bowden has plans to spend four days in California leading to the championship game. He has never been to the Rose Bowl, but he said he would watch the game from home, away from the crowds, in his favorite leather chair. Kickoff is scheduled for past his bedtime, but he will force himself to stay up. “Unless it’s a boring game,” he said. “If one of them is running away with it in the third quarter, I’m going to sleep. I’ll read about it in the morning.”",

    "source": "Anglicans to Seek Pact to Prevent a Schism <eos> CANTERBURY, England — Nearly three weeks of discussion aimed at preventing a breakup of the worldwide Anglican Communion over homosexuality ended Sunday at a conference here with 650 bishops and archbishops agreeing to seek a new pact among all parties to the ecclesiastical controversy. The Most Rev. Rowan Williams , the archbishop of Canterbury, announced a consensus to seek the pact, known as a covenant, in the absence of a formal vote at the Lambeth Conference, which meets in Canterbury every 10 years. Archbishop Williams, the supreme voice of a church that is reckoned the third largest Christian denomination, after the Roman Catholic and Orthodox faiths, had decided ahead of the meeting to avoid resolutions and votes in hopes of preventing a schism that might well rupture worldwide Anglicanism more severely than at any time in more than 450 years. The push for a covenant amounted to a stratagem for finding both short- and long-term solutions to a dispute that has bitterly divided an estimated 80 million Anglicans worldwide. The split has expressed itself most keenly in the starkly opposed views of traditionalists, primarily in Africa and Asia, who oppose any concessions on homosexuality, and of more liberal elements, especially in the United States and Canada, who favor the ordination of openly gay and lesbian clergy members and church blessings of same-sex unions. Archbishop Williams told reporters that he hoped Anglican leaders could agree on a draft covenant within a year, but said that winning approval for it among the 44 national and regional churches of the Anglican Communion could take until 2013. That period might coincide with a push among the bishops here to hold another Lambeth meeting after only five years. In the meantime, the archbishop said, agreement was widespread for continuing “moratoria” on the ordination of gay and lesbian priests and blessings of same-sex unions and for matching restraint by conservatives who threatened to walk out unless traditional views proscribing church acceptance of homosexuality prevailed. A document published as the conference ended spoke of the moratoriums ushering in “a season of gracious restraint” while the covenant is negotiated. The archbishop said the decision to seek agreement on a covenant while urging church liberals in North America to hold back on the openings to homosexuals was broadly supported in the small-group gatherings of about 40 prelates each that, together with smaller Bible study groups, constituted the main work of the conference. The small groups were called indabas, after a Zulu term for tribal meetings, often at a village level, to iron out disputes by discussion. Like the bar on voting, the process was intended to avoid breaking into disarray over homosexuality. The outcome appeared to be a modest triumph for Archbishop Williams, a bearded, Welsh-born theologian with liberal views on gay and lesbian issues who was enthroned as the archbishop of Canterbury in 2003. That was just as strains among Anglicans over homosexuality were coming to a boil over the election of an openly gay Episcopal bishop, Gene Robinson, in New Hampshire. Archbishop Williams, 58, has been criticized by conservatives and liberals alike for his efforts to steer a middle course. Even church moderates have suggested that his acknowledged intellectual talents may not have been matched by the political skills and personal force needed to wrench a lasting compromise out of the contending parties. But the conference document, called Indaba Reflections, prepared by a group of bishops, spoke of the “great affection and love” for Archbishop Williams among participants, suggesting that the gathering may have strengthened his hand. He spoke at a news conference with a tone of relieved assurance, while acknowledging more than once that the bishops had met under the threat of a breakup in the Anglican Communion, as the loose network that grew out of the Church of England is called. In one wry aside, he spoke of what he called the communion’s “current rather wobbly state.” “I think we’ve emerged at the end of this conference with some quite surprising results: a surprising level of sheer willingness to stay together, and a surprising level of agreement about what might be necessary to make that happen,” he said. “For all that the details of the covenant proposal still need a great deal of clarification, nonetheless there is a following wind for that. There is also a wide degree of agreement about the need for moratoria on both sides where divisive actions are concerned.” The conference left unclear what form the proposed covenant might take and the extent to which it might seek to lay down a code of practice on homosexuality. Some bishops appeared to see the document as a statement of shared beliefs and a commitment to abide by them; others saw something much looser. Many saw it as a possible step toward a two-tier communion, consisting of churches that embrace the covenant and those that do not, with those that do not still staying, formally but loosely, within the communion. In remarks to reporters, Archbishop Williams said little to clarify what the covenant might entail. But when he described the kind of church he saw emerging from future discussions, he spoke of a willingness to conform to agreed practices that sounded more disciplined than the Anglican Communion has been in recent times. “I hope that a little bit more mutual responsibility and accountability, a bit more willingness to walk in step, will make us more like a church,” he said. In a remark that appeared directed at conservatives and liberals alike, he said Anglicans should work against “the tendency of local churches to get trapped in their local contexts” at the cost of shared spiritual ideals. More pointedly, he appealed to “the North American churches” to stick to moratoriums on the ordination of openly gay clergy and the blessing of same-sex unions, saying their failure to do so would imperil the chances of broad agreement on the proposed covenant. And that, he said, would mean that “our communion will continue to be in great peril.”",

    "source": "The Upside of a Downturn in Silicon Valley <eos> In October 2008, in the early days of the last economic collapse, Sequoia Capital invited founders of technology companies to a frank meeting outlining the new global reality. Silicon Valley had long since shaken off the doldrums of the dot-com bubble, but one of the industry’s most respected venture capital firms was now counseling entrepreneurs to again “batten down the hatches” — to cut costs, to focus on profit, to “spend every dollar as if it were your last” because “it is going to be a rough ride.” The presentation was called “ R.I.P. Good Times ,” and it ended with a challenge meant to inspire founders as well as to scare them: “Get real or go home.” As it happened, Sequoia’s dire warnings never quite came to pass; the tech industry’s good times merely paused for the recession. But the presentation has achieved the status of legend among venture capitalists. Tech investors are known for their strutting optimism, but the best of them are keenly aware of the motivating powers of impending doom. Some of the most successful tech investments of all time — among them Google and Facebook — came about in Silicon Valley’s lean times. This is a paradox of invention, as well as of investing: Bad times feed good ideas, which in turn lead to good times, which breed complacency, waste and lots of bad business plans. No one in the tech industry knows if the recent stock market turbulence will prompt another opportunity to mourn good times. But some venture capitalists are beginning to plan for a leaner era ahead. Sooner rather than later, some external shock — the Dow, China, Europe, Iran, interest rates, the inauguration of President Trump — may prompt a slow-moving retrenchment in the fund-raising for start-ups . Money will dry up, companies will face hard choices, and there will be layoffs, shutdowns and much heartache. That may just be what Silicon Valley needs. Many investors are optimistic about the clarifying possibilities of a downturn. The boom has made Silicon Valley soft: Companies are spending too much, investors are funding too many me-too ideas, and most founders have never had to confront any limits to their overweening ambitions. Venture capitalists won’t quite say they are looking forward to a correction, but some do say that a bust could toughen up the place. Video Farhad Manjoo of The New York Times discusses the possible benefits of a Silicon Valley downturn. And if a downturn in start-up funding is going to come anyway, you might argue that it couldn’t come soon enough: Not just R.I.P. good times, but good riddance, and let the bad times roll. “The founders who start companies in bad times are the ones who are really driven,” said Roelof Botha, one of Sequoia’s partners. “They’re not jumping on the bandwagon to get to Silicon Valley just because it’s the fashionable thing to do today.” Mr. Botha offered a story from his past at PayPal, where he began his Silicon Valley career in March 2000, the same month the Nasdaq hit a peak that it would take 15 years to reach again . “Most of the people who were building start-ups in that era, including us at PayPal, had only seen one economic environment in our working lives,” he said. But Michael Moritz, another Sequoia partner who was one of PayPal’s board members, repeatedly counseled caution. “He was the one board member drilling into our heads, ‘Guys, you need to work on the runway — how many months do you have left, and what are you going to do about it?’” Mr. Botha said, recalling Mr. Moritz’s advice. At Mr. Moritz’s prompting, PayPal’s executives decided to take what was then an extraordinary step: They began to charge users a fee to use the payment service. The company also worked hard to keep its costs down. “That focus was instrumental in PayPal’s survival,” Mr. Botha said. “We could have been spending money willy-nilly and fallen by the wayside by accident.” Instead, within a year, PayPal was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion, and its founders and executives went on to become Silicon Valley luminaries . Over the last year, as money flowing into Silicon Valley went from a gush to a flood, Mr. Botha, like other venture investors, began advising start-ups to raise funds even if they didn’t need them immediately, to have cash on hand for a potential downturn. The companies that did so will have a leg up, because a downturn offers a few immediate advantage for well-positioned start-ups: It lowers prices and wreaks havoc on more vulnerable competitors. Salaries for software engineers could fall, and they could become easier to recruit. The price of office space could go down. Other less tangible costs — Bay Area traffic, marketing, employees’ overall cost of living — could also decline significantly.

Mr. Botha said those who start companies during a downturn “are really driven.” Credit Brian Ach/Getty Images for TechCrunch “For start-ups, the only thing that is easier during a boom is access to cheap capital,” said Samuel H. Altman, president of the start-up incubator Y Combinator. “Every other thing is harder. And an environment of less noise and less competition makes it easier for people to do something that they’re really committed to over the long term.” Silicon Valley’s established venture capitalists, too, will see some upside to a downturn. If the hedge funds and other global investors that have recently poured money into tech begin to pull back, competition for investment in the hottest start-ups will cool, allowing V.C.s to buy more of a company for less money. “I’m not sure that we’re ready to declare that we’re now officially in leaner times,” said Scott Kupor, the managing partner of the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz. Still, Mr. Kupor noted that as a relatively young firm, Andreessen will likely be putting more money into start-ups over the next few years instead of looking to extract money through sales or initial public offerings — which means that lower prices for start-ups could be good for its portfolio. “All other things being equal, people would rather an environment where asset prices are lower and where there’s less availability of capital, so if one of our companies breaks out, they have less competition from 10 other start-ups going after them,” Mr. Kupor said. Danielle Morrill, co-founder of Mattermark, a company that collects and analyzes data on private market funding, pointed to another benefit that some start-ups may see in tougher times. They could begin to pitch themselves as money-saving services. Mattermark is a software as a service business — a firm that charges a subscription fee for access — and businesses of that type, Ms. Morrill said, can say that they are saving customers money over the competition. “People are going to start talking about which companies are countercyclical,” meaning they’ll prosper in bad times, Ms. Morrill said. But she noted a problem with making such calls: “You don’t really know if you’re countercyclical until you go through a cycle like what we may have. And then you’ll find out.” And that gets to the biggest question if we do enter a gloomy period for start-ups: whether founders will be up for managing in a more stressful, frugal environment. Ms. Morrill said that the current market conditions “could totally affect my fund-raising, and there’s only so much you can change in a week or a month about the way you’re running your company.” She added: “I can say we shouldn’t buy this expensive coffee, but that’s $100. The scarier thoughts are, when will we have to lay off some of our staff? You look at yourself in the mirror and you say, ‘I don’t want to be that C.E.O.’” In good times, in other words, it’s relatively easy to be a great start-up chief executive. When winter comes to Silicon Valley, we’ll find out which founders really shine. A lot of them won’t. Things won’t be pretty. But maybe it’s time.",

    "source": "BP Done Pumping Cement Into Well <eos> HOUSTON — For more than three months, an oil -weary nation has waited for the moment when engineers would begin pumping cement into BP ’s runaway well, in hopes of plugging its flow for good. That moment arrived quietly on Thursday, with cement following the tons of mud already poured into the well in the operation called a static kill . Because no significant amount of oil has leaked since the well was tightly capped on July 15, the start of the cementing was almost anticlimactic. BP did not even hold its regular daily briefing, saying that Kent Wells, the senior vice president who usually explains the technical details to reporters, was traveling. When the cement operation was completed in the afternoon, the company put out a brief announcement. Television newscasts, for months fixated on the spectacle of oil gushing from the broken riser pipe on live underwater video, barely covered the transition. Thad W. Allen, the retired Coast Guard admiral who heads the federal spill response effort, told reporters at the government’s midday briefing that once the cement job was completed, “We can all breathe a little easier.” He added, “This is not the end, but it will virtually assure us there will be no chance of oil leaking into the environment.” By applying cement to the well from a surface vessel, technicians can plug most, if not all, of the drill pipe and oil reservoir below. Although the static kill is likely to seal the volatile well permanently, final victory will not be declared until a relief well is completed and it intercepts the well in the middle to later part of August, according to both Admiral Allen and senior BP executives. The first of two relief wells is still 100 feet from intersecting the Macondo well. It will take five to seven days to complete once the cement applied during the static kill dries by the weekend’s end. A second relief well is being drilled in case the first misses the mark. Since blowing out on April 20, killing 11 workers aboard the Deepwater Horizon platform, the well has spewed nearly five million barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The tight-fitting capping device that stopped the leak three weeks ago was considered a temporary solution. Because the static kill is not guaranteed to pour cement through the annulus, the portion of the drill pipe between the inner piping and the outer casing, leakage may still remain after the kill, according to officials. But the 18,000-foot relief well can penetrate the entire pipe, after which technicians can test to see how much more cement is needed to kill the well completely. Technicians working on the static kill said that they could not guarantee that the well was now fully plugged. They said they had not been able to determine whether any oil and gas remained trapped in the casing, drill pipe or annular areas that might have been bypassed by the injection of mud and cement. “It’s almost like a mystery you are trying to unravel,” Admiral Allen said. “The question is: what is the path of the cement to the bottom?” Admiral Allen said the mystery would be solved conclusively only by the relief well, and by a final pumping of mud and cement into any areas not reached by the static kill. But Greg McCormack, program director of the Petroleum Extension Service at the University of Texas Austin, said, that the fact that the cementing was finished so quickly “means they had a good cement job, which means that they probably cemented all the way down to the bottom in the production casing and reached the reservoir.” He added, “If there aren’t any leaks anywhere else, that means this well is done.”",

Michael Carter-Williams had 20 points, 9 rebounds and 9 assists, and Robert Covington added 17 points to keep Philadelphia from tying the 0-18 start by the 2009-10 Nets. Philadelphia shot just 39 percent against the worst defense in the league and turned the ball over 19 times. The 76ers scored only nine points in the second quarter. Philadelphia had been competitive in recent losses to Western Conference heavyweights like San Antonio, Dallas and Portland, and entered this game with real hope that the streak would come to an end, even though they were missing their leading scorer, Tony Wroten, for the fourth straight game. Gorgui Dieng had 15 points and 16 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who shot just 35.7 percent and turned the ball over 19 times to lose for the 11th time in 13 games. As much as Coach Brett Brown tried to minimize the streak and the prospects of tying the record, he did allow himself to envision how he would celebrate a win when he spoke at a morning practice. “Cartwheels, somersaults, great dinner with my family,” Brown said. “Hug my players. Really, salute the fans.” CELTICS 109, PISTONS 102 Jeff Green scored 32 points, including a 3-pointer as Boston opened overtime on the way to ending a five-game losing streak by defeating Detroit at home. The loss was the 10th in a row for Detroit. Greg Monroe scored 15 of his 29 points after the 3 minute 13 second mark of the fourth, when the Pistons erased an 11-point deficit. But Detroit never recovered after giving up the first three baskets to start the extra period. HAWKS 112, HEAT 102 Jeff Teague scored 27 points, Kyle Korver scored 18 and Atlanta handed Miami another home loss. Dennis Schroder scored 16 and Paul Millsap finished with 14 for the Hawks. Dwyane Wade scored 28 points and Chris Bosh finished with 27 points and 11 rebounds for Miami. BULLS 102, HORNETS 95 Pau Gasol had 19 points and 15 rebounds, Joakim Noah and Nikola Mirotic each posted double-doubles, and visiting Chicago handed Charlotte its 10th straight loss. Kirk Hinrich came up with two big 3-pointers in the final three minutes to help the Bulls (12-7) hold on and improve to 10-3 on the road. Kemba Walker had 23 points, and Lance Stephenson had a season-high 20 points to lead the Hornets (4-15), who have lost 12 of 13. WIZARDS 111, LAKERS 95 Bradley Beal scored 27 points, John Wall had 17 points and 15 assists, and host Washington beat Kobe Bryant and Los Angeles. Bryant finished with 29 points — 15 of them in the first quarter, when he shot 6 for 11. He missed nine of his final 11 shots. ROCKETS 105, GRIZZLIES 96 James Harden scored 21 points, and Trevor Ariza and Jason Terry each added 16 to help host Houston defeat Memphis. The Grizzlies (15-3) had won five in a row, and their two previous losses this season had been by a combined five points. Houston played without three starters, including Dwight Howard. MAVERICKS 107, BUCKS 105 Monta Ellis hit a wild, fallaway jumper at the buzzer, lifting visiting Dallas over Milwaukee. Brandon Knight scored 25 points and Khris Middleton added 21 for the Bucks in their third straight loss.

    "source": "Patent Law Battle a Boon to Lobbyists <eos> WASHINGTON — A fight has erupted in Congress over the question of whether drug makers and other companies should be allowed to keep patents they obtained by misrepresentation or cheating. The issue has emerged as a contentious point in legislation to overhaul patent laws. In several cases, the courts have voided patents after finding that companies intentionally misled the Patent and Trademark Office. The legislation, affecting a wide swath of the American economy, has been a boon to lobbyists. In 15 months, two dueling business coalitions have spent $4.3 million lobbying on the legislation, which calls for the biggest changes in United States patent law in more than 50 years. Companies from almost every major industry have joined the battle. Patents can protect an invention for up to 20 years. But federal judges can void patents after finding that companies engaged in “inequitable conduct,” meaning that they misrepresented or concealed information with an intent to deceive the patent office. In such cases, judges can declare the patents unenforceable. Robert A. Armitage, a senior vice president and general counsel of Eli Lilly & Company, said, “This is like imposing the death penalty for relatively minor acts of misconduct.” Brand-name drug companies are urging Congress to eliminate the penalty — or to curtail it as proposed under a bill passed by the House. Debra S. Barrett, a vice president of the American unit of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the world’s largest maker of generic drugs, said the changes sought by brand-name drug companies “would make it easier for them to cheat and get away with it, easier for them to defend their patents and more difficult for us to get generic products onto the market in a timely way.” Consumer groups like AARP share that concern. They want to speed access to generic medicines, which can cost 30 percent to 80 percent less than the equivalent brand-name drugs. The House has approved a comprehensive patent bill that would make it harder to prove inequitable conduct. Senators are haggling over a companion bill, approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and hope to take it to the floor this summer. In the last 15 years, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which handles patent cases, has affirmed findings of inequitable conduct in at least 40 cases, including 14 that involved pharmaceutical or health care products. Similar findings have been issued by federal district judges in an unknown number of cases that were not appealed. Courts have found that drug makers knowingly submitted false statements to the patent office, inaccurately described experiments and concealed information that contradicted their claims. In one case, the appeals court said that Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals improperly failed to disclose that it had not performed an experiment described in its application for a patent related to synthetic human growth hormone. In another case, the court said Pharmacia had used an “inaccurate and misleading” affidavit in obtaining a patent for a glaucoma medication. Brand-name drug companies say that generic drug makers routinely attack their patents by accusing them of inequitable conduct when they are blameless or guilty of no more than honest mistakes. The aggressive use of such accusations has become “a plague on the patent system,” the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group, told Congress. Harry F. Manbeck Jr., who was commissioner of patents and trademarks under the first President Bush, said the existing penalty was a powerful deterrent to misconduct. “Patents can be very valuable,” Mr. Manbeck said. “There are strong incentives to want to get them. Cheating occurs from time to time. The inequitable conduct doctrine says that if you cheated to get a patent, you should not be able to enforce it.” Under federal regulations, people applying for a patent have a duty to deal with the patent office in “candor, good faith and honesty.” They are supposed to disclose if their invention was previously known or used by others, offered for sale or described in a publication. In that case, it may not be innovative enough to warrant a patent. In reviewing an application, patent examiners can search the relevant literature, but may not find all the pertinent information, so they depend on applicants to be forthright. “If Congress eliminated or reduced the penalty for inequitable conduct, applicants would no longer have a reason to disclose all the information they are aware of,” said Robert D. Budens, president of the Patent Office Professional Association, which represents 5,500 examiners. Mr. Armitage, the Lilly executive, said: “The doctrine of inequitable conduct is used so aggressively in litigation that it has unintended consequences. Applicants give the Patent and Trademark Office too much information, to avoid allegations that they concealed anything, and they refuse to explain the information, to avoid later allegations that they engaged in some form of misrepresentation.” James C. Greenwood, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, said, “The poor patent examiner gets a dump truck full of information that he has to pore over without any assistance from the applicant.” The number of patent applications — 467,243 in 2007 — has nearly doubled in the last 10 years and has more than tripled since 1987. Jon W. Dudas, the under secretary of commerce for intellectual property, said: “We are getting more and more unpatentable ideas, worse and worse quality applications. Historically, in the last 40 years, the allowance rate — the percentage of applications ultimately approved — hovered around 62 percent to 72 percent. It went up to 72 percent in 2000, but dropped to 43 percent in the first quarter of this year.” A major impetus for the patent legislation is the desire of technology companies to limit the damage awards and legal costs they sometimes face when they are accused of infringing patents. Companies like Cisco and Palm say the disputes drain resources that could be better spent on research and innovation. Many of these companies have banded together in the Coalition for Patent Fairness, which in the last 15 months has spent $2.5 million for a small army of lobbyists including Mark W. Isakowitz, a Republican, and Steven A. Elmendorf, a longtime Democratic strategist. A rival group, the Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform, consists of about 50 companies that zealously guard their intellectual property and are more likely to file suit to protect their patents. It includes pharmaceutical and biotech companies like Genzyme, Lilly, Merck and Pfizer. This coalition has paid $1.8 million to lobbyists, much of it to the law firm of Akin Gump.",

    "source": "Google Unveils Wireless Payment System <eos> Google is among the first out of the gate in the attempt to make leather wallets go the way of the typewriter. On Thursday, the technology giant introduced Google Wallet, a mobile application that will allow consumers to wave their cellphones at a retailer’s terminal to make a payment instead of using a credit card. The app, for the Android operating system, will also enable users to redeem special coupons and earn loyalty points. Starting this summer, the wallet will be available on the Nexus S 4G phone on Sprint and able to hold certain MasterCards issued by Citibank. It will also hold a virtual Google Prepaid MasterCard. The mobile wallet will work at any of the 124,000 merchants that accept MasterCard’s PayPass terminals, which take contactless payments, and more than 300,000 merchants outside the United States. The wallet is powered by a technology called near-field communications, which is incorporated into a chip in mobile phones and sends a message to the merchants’ terminals. “Eventually, you will be able to put everything in your wallet,” Stephanie Tilenius, vice president for commerce at Google, said at a news conference. That grand vision will take a while to come to fruition. Various players have been working on mobile wallets for years, but they have not gained traction because the companies have not been able to agree on how they would be paid or who would control the wallets. Cellular carriers, banks , credit card issuers, payment networks and technology companies all have a stake in this battle. With its wallet, Google plans to make money by offering consumers promotions as they shop. For instance, it plans to introduce “Google Offers” — advertising deals from local and online businesses that can be found online or sent through the phone. Like Groupon, Google will collect a fee from participating retailers every time a person redeems a coupon. Citibank will collect the same fees as it would in a traditional credit card transaction. Google Wallet will need some time to become fully functional nationwide. While Google has worked with more than 15 retailers, like American Eagle Outfitters, Bloomingdale’s, the Container Store and Jamba Juice, they all need to upgrade their payment terminals. When they do, consumers will also be able to store and redeem deals with the wallet. Merchants in New York and San Francisco are expected to be ready this summer. Once the retailers’ technology is in place, consumers will be able to wave their phone at the checkout counter and, in one swoop, discounts will be applied, loyalty points will be awarded and payments made. Someday, Google said, when consumers enter the store, their phones may serve up a list of items they recently bought, and offer them related discounts. The wallet app itself will require a PIN, as will each transaction. The payment credentials will be encrypted and stored on a chip inside the phone. Google emphasized that the wallet would be open to all businesses and invited other banks, credit card issuers, payment networks, mobile carriers and merchants to work with it. “I expect that other payment networks and other banks will join this effort, though in some cases it will be a hedge strategy they employ along with their own mobile payment initiatives,” said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research. “Since these payments utilize the same underlying business model as cards today, there is not significant disruption risk for these players.” Google is also working with First Data, which processes payments and will ensure the security of the transaction. If the phone was stolen, the credit cards inside could be remotely disabled. Consumers would have the same “zero liability” for unauthorized transactions made with their phones as they would with plastic cards. Separately, PayPal filed a suit on Thursday against Google and two of its former executives who are now at Google, including Ms. Tilenius. The suit claims that they misappropriated trade secrets from PayPal’s mobile-payment business. A Google spokesman declined to comment because he said they have not yet received a copy of the complaint. Eventually, Google said, its wallet may be able to hold much more, including car keys and airline boarding passes. But access to such items will still require a fully charged phone. If the phone battery dies, even Ms. Tilenius of Google conceded, “I think you need to use your plastic at that point.”",

    "source": "Maryland Sets a Health Cost for Wal-Mart <eos> ANNAPOLIS, Md., Jan. 12 - The Maryland legislature passed a law Thursday that would require Wal-Mart Stores to increase spending on employee health insurance, a measure that is expected to be a model for other states. The legislature's move, which overrode a veto by Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich, was a response to growing criticism that Wal-Mart, the nation's largest private employer, has skimped on benefits and shifted health costs to state governments. The vote came after a furious lobbying battle by Wal-Mart and by labor and liberal groups, and is likely to encourage lawmakers in dozens of other states who are considering similar legislation. Many state legislatures have looked to Maryland as a test case, as they face fast-rising Medicaid costs, and Wal-Mart's critics say that too many of its employees have been forced to turn to Medicaid. Under the Maryland law, employers with 10,000 or more workers in the state must spend at least 8 percent of their payrolls on health insurance, or else pay the difference into a state Medicaid fund. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman said the company was \"weighing its options,\" including a lawsuit to challenge the law because it is close to that 8 percent threshold already. It is unclear how much the new law will cost Wal-Mart in Maryland -- or around the country, if similar laws are adopted, because Wal-Mart has not publicly divulged what it spends on health care. But it was concerned enough about the bill to hire four firms to lobby the legislature intensely over the last two months, and contributed at least $4,000 to the re-election campaign of Governor Ehrlich. A spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, Mia Masten, said that \"everyone should have access to affordable health insurance, but this legislation does nothing to accomplish this goal.\" \"This is about partisan politics,\" she said, \"and this is poor public policy driven by special-interest groups.\" There are four employers in Maryland with more than 10,000 workers -- among them, Johns Hopkins University, the grocery chain Giant Food and the military contractor Northrop Grumman, but only Wal-Mart falls below the 8 percent threshold on health care spending. A Democratic lawmaker who sponsored the legislation, State Senator Gloria G. Lawlah , maintained: \"This is not a Wal-Mart bill, it's a Medicaid bill.\" This bill says to the conglomerates, 'Don't dump the employees that you refuse to insure into our Medicaid systems.' \" Opponents said the law would open the door for broader state regulation of health care spending by private companies and would send the message that Maryland is antibusiness. \"The message is, 'Don't come here,' \" said Senator E. J. Pipkin, a Republican. \"This is an anti-jobs bill.\" Several lawmakers said that in the end, the law would require Wal-Mart to spend only slightly more than it does now on health insurance. But with Wal-Mart refusing to disclose what it pays for health costs, it was unclear how much more it would be required to pay. This is the second time that the Maryland legislature, which is dominated by Democrats, has passed the Wal-Mart bill. Governor Ehrlich vetoed it late last year, inviting a senior Wal-Mart executive to sit by his side as he did so. Indeed, the bill is shaping up as an issue in the fall campaign, with Republicans and their business allies lining up against it, and Democrats and their labor union supporters backing it. Wal-Mart has 53 stores and employs about 17,000 people in Maryland. Debate was particularly emotional among representatives from Maryland's Eastern Shore, where Wal-Mart recently announced plans to build a distribution center that would employ up to 1,000. Wal-Mart executives have strongly suggested that they might build the center elsewhere if lawmakers passed the health care bill. In a passionate speech in the State Senate, J. Lowell Stoltzfus, a Republican, warned that the bill \"jeopardizes good employment for my people.\" \"It's going to hurt us very bad,\" he added, The bill's passage underscored the success of the union campaign to turn Wal-Mart into a symbol of what is wrong in the American health care system. Wal-Mart has come under severe criticism because it insures less than half its United States work force and because its employees routinely show up, in larger numbers than employees of other retailers, on state Medicaid rolls. In response to the complaints, the company introduced a new health care plan late last year, with premiums as low as $11 a month. Consumer advocates specializing in health care are hoping that the Maryland law will be the first of many. \"You're going to see similar legislation being introduced,\" said Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a nonprofit health advocacy organization, \"and debated in at least three dozen more states, and at least some of those states will end up also requiring large employers to provide health care coverage.\" Mr. Pollack suggested that he did not expect any groundswell of opposition from corporate America. Most companies, he said, provide insurance and know that the costs of medical treatment for uninsured people are reflected in their insurance premiums. Mr. Pollack said that, by his organization's calculations, the cost of such treatment drove up employer premiums by $922 a family last year. In 2006, he said, the added cost could reach $1,000 a family. \"Those employers should welcome the fact that the companies that do not offer coverage now will be forced to step up to the plate,\" he said. State lawmakers here in Annapolis took repeated swipes at Wal-Mart during debate over the bill on Thursday. It appeared that the company's intensive lobbying campaign in Maryland, including advertisements arguing that the requirement would hurt small businesses, might have soured some lawmakers. Senator Lawlah called the lobbying \"horrendous\" and adding, \"I have never seen anything like it.\" Frank D. Boston III, the chief lobbyist for Wal-Mart on the health care bill, stood in the main corridor of the Capitol building on Thursday wearing a look of resignation. Referring to unions in the state, he said, \"They have a power we can't match, and we worked this bill extremely hard.\" Class-Action Case in Pennsylvania (By Bloomberg News) A Pennsylvania judge granted class-action status yesterday to a lawsuit contending that Wal-Mart employees had been pressed to work through breaks and after hours. The suit could include as many as 150,000 current or former employees in Pennsylvania who have worked at a Wal-Mart store or at the company's Sam's Club warehouse chain since March 1998, Michael Donovan, the lead plaintiff's lawyer, said. The latest class-action filing against Wal-Mart came after a California jury last month awarded workers $172.3 million in another off-the-clock case. Wal-Mart is appealing. The company settled a similar case in Colorado for $50 million. Wal-Mart has given \"every indication\" that it will go to trial rather than settle, Mr. Donovan said. A Wal-Mart spokesman, Kevin Thornton, said the company was considering appealing the decision.",

    "source": "Verdict Elusive in Baltimore Mayor’s Trial <eos> WASHINGTON — Six days into their deliberations, jurors in the trial of Mayor Sheila Dixon of Baltimore sent a note to the judge on Monday saying they had reached an impasse. “We cannot come to a unanimous decision on all counts,” the jurors wrote to Judge Dennis M. Sweeney. In response, the judge asked the jurors if they had reached a decision on any of the counts. Without answering that question, the jurors said they would continue deliberations on Tuesday because of “new things brought to light.” Ms. Dixon is accused of stealing $1,500 in gift cards meant for needy families. The cards were left over from a charity event and had been donated by a developer, Ronald H. Lipscomb, whom Ms. Dixon dated in 2003 and 2004. Ms. Dixon was accused of using the cards to buy items at Target, Toys “R” Us, Old Navy and Best Buy — including, according to court documents, a PlayStation video game console, a digital camcorder, DVDs and CDs. During the trial, in Baltimore City Circuit Court, two charges were thrown out for lack of evidence. Ms. Dixon’s lawyers have argued that she believed some of the cards were personal gifts from an anonymous admirer. Monday’s note from the jury was the most recent indication of contentious deliberations. In the first days of deliberations, jurors requested early release because discussions were getting “out of order” and “heated,” according to juror notes. In response to the note Monday, Ms. Dixon’s lawyer, Arnold Weiner, asked for a mistrial, but Judge Sweeney denied it. Ms. Dixon took office in January 2007 and has generally been viewed as an effective city leader. Throughout the trial, which began Nov. 9, public reaction has tended toward two extremes. Some residents have voiced a sense of outrage that the mayor would steal from children and the needy. Others have accused the prosecutor’s office of wasting time and money on minor offenses. Ms. Dixon faces another trial in the spring on two perjury counts. Those charges stem from an accusation that she failed to report on city ethics forms gifts from Mr. Lipscomb, including money, travel and clothes. Mr. Lipscomb’s company received millions of dollars’ worth of city tax credits for its development projects in 2003 and 2004, the years he dated the mayor.",

    "source": "Target to Stock More Environmentally Friendly Products <eos> When Eric Ryan helped start Method Products in 2001, the market for environmentally friendly soaps and cleaning products, he recalled, was a “niche of a niche of a niche.” No longer. Target, one of the country’s largest retailers, announced on Tuesday that it would expand its inventory of “natural, organic and sustainable” goods to meet growing customer demand. The company said it would introduce more than 120 new products over the next several months, and unveiled a new umbrella category for these items — “Made to Matter — Handpicked by Target.” “Almost all of our guests, 97 percent, say they buy some product that is natural, organic or sustainable,” said Kathryn A. Tesija, Target’s executive vice president for merchandising and supply chain. “They’re looking for products in this category,” she said. “We’re making it easy by calling them out.” For this initiative, which has been in the works since 2012, Target is working with 17 brands whose goods it already stocks — like Seventh Generation, Vita Coco, Kashi and Burt’s Bees — to provide new or adjusted products exclusive to Target for at least six months. In some cases, what is new might be as minor as a different flavor or scent, while in others, the newness will be more significant, like diapers without bleach, made by Seventh Generation, or an air freshener that is not in an aerosol can, made by Method. In recent years, organic food and products have expanded from specialty stores and into the aisles of many mass-market retailers. According to the Organic Trade Association, the industry grew to $31.5 billion in United States sales in 2012, the most recent data available, from $8.4 billion a decade earlier. From 2011 to 2012, the sector grew 10.3 percent. (The world of “natural” products has also expanded in recent years, but that distinction is almost entirely unregulated so it generally tells consumers nothing about what they are buying.)

    "source": "Iran’s Supreme Leader Condemns Mob Attack on Saudi Embassy <eos> TEHRAN — Iran’s highest leader strongly denounced on Wednesday a mob attack on Saudi Arabia ’s embassy in Tehran this month, saying the event was “very bad” and “detrimental to the country and Islam.” The embassy attack followed the execution of a prominent Shiite cleric in Saudi Arabia, and it seemingly played into the Saudis’ hands by shifting the focus of global outrage to Shiite Iran from the Sunni kingdom. The attack led Saudi Arabia and several of its allies to cut ties with Iran. Analysts said the comments from the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , could be tied to a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday, where the embassy attack is high on the agenda. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was even more critical of the attack. “This was an act that we were not proud of,” Mr. Zarif told an audience on Wednesday in Davos, Switzerland, at the World Economic Forum. “It was an act against our security, our sovereignty, and we are prosecuting the people who committed that horrendous act.” As he has in the past, Mr. Zarif said Iran was eager to work with its neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, to resolve regional issues, particularly the war in Syria. “I think our Saudi neighbors need to realize that confrontation is in the interest of nobody,” he said. “Iran is there to work with you. Iran does not want to exclude anyone from the region. There is no need to engage in a confrontation.” Despite Mr. Zarif’s conciliatory language, Iran and Saudi Arabia are engaged in a bitter sectarian proxy war in Syria, with Tehran backing President Bashar al-Assad and Riyadh propping up the rebel forces opposing him. In remarks to election officials that were published on his website, Khamenei.ir , Ayatollah Khamenei also weighed in on a dispute that has the potential to shape Iran’s political course for the next several years. He voiced strong support for a 12-member vetting committee that is said to have disqualified nearly all reformist candidates in coming elections for the Majlis, or Parliament, and for the Assembly of Experts, a council that in the future will elect his successor. The vetting committee, the Guardian Council, which has been severely criticized by the reform camp, has not publicly explained its actions. In his remarks, Ayatollah Khamenei said that mistakes could be made but that they “don’t justify attacks on legal entities.” If upheld, the bar on reformist candidates would mean that President Hassan Rouhani, who calls himself a moderate, will in all likelihood confront a hostile Parliament if he tries to introduce measures that he has promised to expand personal freedoms. Ayatollah Khamenei went even further, making it clear that the reformists faced an uphill battle to exert any influence in the immediate future. “I have said that even those who are against the establishment should take part in the election,” he said. “I did not, however, mean that those who are against the establishment must be allowed to find their way into the Majlis. You do not find any country in the world where people who are against the system are allowed into any decision-making bodies.” It is an article of faith among conservatives that the reformists object to clerical rule and have a secret agenda of changing the basic nature of the Islamic Republic. Ayatollah Khamenei has been preaching a hard line since the signing of a nuclear agreement with the United States and other nations in July, warning against any softening in Iran’s anti-Western stance, and he has doubled down since the deal went into effect last weekend. The ayatollah complimented the actions of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy, which detained 10 United States Navy sailors this month after they entered Iran’s waters not far from one of its naval bases. “What the I.R.G.C. youth did in the Persian Gulf was absolutely the right thing to do, though I have not had the time to thank them yet,” Ayatollah Khamenei said. “Our politicians must act in the same way. Detect the line through which they are invading and stop it with strength.” On Monday, the Iranian police said they had arrested more than 150 people in connection with the Saudi Embassy attacks, which left the building in flames. While deploring the incident, Ayatollah Khamenei warned government officials not to “attack the devoted, revolutionary and Hezbollahi youth, merely because of events like those at the embassies of Saudi Arabia and Britain.” In 2011, crowds entered the British Embassy in Tehran , leading to the severing of ties. Ayatollah Khamenei later denounced that assault as well, and ties were restored last year .",

    "source": "Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney, Takes a Victory Lap in Albany After Winning Corruption Cases <eos> ALBANY — He was hailed as a man of “tremendous courage” by one interviewer. He was trailed, everywhere he went, by a flock of reporters and cameras. He made a packed audience of government watchdog supporters “weak-kneed,” as one spectator posted on Twitter. It was the prosecutorial equivalent of the victory lap, the going-to-Disney World moment after the Super Bowl, if comparisons can be made between household-name football stars and federal law-enforcement officials. Preet Bharara, the soft-spoken crusader who has done for clean government what Bernie Sanders did for Democratic Socialism, had come to Albany. In a season of discontent with elected leaders in the state capital — and in a year when the federal prosecutor’s office Mr. Bharara occupies has been fictionalized in the TV show “Billions” — Mr. Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, enjoyed an admiring reception on his first trip to the scene, so to speak, of the crime. He urged a conference of New York State mayors at the Hilton hotel to be watchful for corruption in city contracts. Seats to an afternoon speech and interview, broadcast live from a performance studio of the regional radio station WAMC, were snapped up in less than a day. Mr. Bharara, 48, had a somewhat more equivocal greeting for the city that has provided him fodder for some of his highest-profile triumphs, including, most recently, the convictions of the former speaker of the State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, and the majority leader of the State Senate, Dean G. Skelos. Publicizing his afternoon speech on Twitter, Mr. Bharara chose a quote from Edward R. Murrow: “A nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves.” In his speech from the performance studio, Mr. Bharara repeatedly hammered the complacency and implicit collaboration of other lawmakers, whom he called “enablers,” in the “rancid culture” of Albany. “What’s been going on in New York State government lately is simultaneously heartbreaking, head-scratching and almost comic,” he said, echoing remarks he made last month in front of the Kentucky Legislature. Mr. Bharara rejected complaints about prosecutorial overreach. “Blaming the prosecutors is not leadership,” he said. “Whining is not leadership.” In a Q. and A. after his speech, Mr. Bharara said his public-corruption unit was “not closing up shop anytime soon.” But he was more circumspect about other investigations, demurring when asked about an inquiry into the Buffalo Billion , a plan offered by the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, which has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into that beleaguered western New York city. And he offered no more than a previously released statement about the end of his investigation into the demise of the Moreland Commission, an anti-corruption panel established by Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat. About the only person who seemed determined to treat Mr. Bharara’s appearance as a nonevent was Mr. Cuomo, who sat facing Mr. Bharara but did not speak to him at the swearing-in ceremony of Janet DiFiore, the state’s new top judge, at the Court of Appeals. Mr. Cuomo clapped from his seat when Mr. Bharara was introduced. Mr. Bharara returned the favor from his seat in the second row, behind a group of Cuomo administration veterans that included Lawrence S. Schwartz, the former secretary to the governor, whose strong-armed interactions with the Moreland panel were documented by The New York Times . Mr. Cuomo, noting the Appeals Court judges’ comfortable salaries, mentioned that he might someday nominate himself to the court. The overflow crowd cackled. Mr. Bharara did not. After the ceremony, Mr. Cuomo left by the rear of the court, while Mr. Bharara left by the front entrance. Neither man attended the cheese-and-fruit reception. Reporters outside the court promptly bombarded Mr. Cuomo with questions about Mr. Bharara’s visit, the relationship between the two men and whether Mr. Bharara should be considered a “champion” of the democratic process. Through the entire session, Mr. Cuomo managed to avoid even saying the other man’s name. “I think his point that we need ethics reform is the same thing that I have been saying,” Mr. Cuomo said, later noting that when he served as state attorney general, he had successfully prosecuted a state senator and a comptroller on corruption charges. If Mr. Bharara did not find Mr. Cuomo’s jokes particularly amusing, his own witticisms met with more appreciation from his audiences in Albany — even if more than a few of those jokes were groaners involving Mr. Bharara’s fierce devotion to Bruce Springsteen, who had a show scheduled in Albany on Monday night. The setup: “I understand that Bruce Springsteen is in town.” The punch line: “If any of you have tickets, I am perfectly prepared to subpoena them.” (“Darn it, that’s better than anything I could’ve written for a US Atty,” Young Il Kim, a writer for “Billions,” which stars Paul Giamatti as a federal prosecutor bent on rooting out Wall Street wrongdoing, remarked on Twitter .) Asked during the radio broadcast whether he had any interest in running for elected office, Mr. Bharara invoked, once again, the other celebrity in Albany on Monday night. “Let me put it this way, given that Bruce Springsteen is in town,” he said. “I was not born to run.”",

    "source": "Optimism for an Agreement on Greek Debt, but Not for Long-Term Stability <eos> BRUSSELS — Greece and its European partners appeared on Monday night to be heading for a deal by the end of the week that would secure further funding for Greece and a likely promise of more debt relief in return for changes in the pension and tax systems, European Union officials said. Even so, there is no great confidence that a deal reached when all 28 European Union leaders have a summit meeting here Thursday and Friday will be more than a short-term easing of the Greek crisis, which has preoccupied the European Union for the last five years. And there remains skepticism that the Greek government will follow through on whatever deal is finally struck. One senior official from a European country, asked if this may be peace in our time, answered, “Well, it’s peace for a week.” Given the past pattern of broken promises and sudden changes of position from the left-wing Greek government of Alexis Tsipras , even this outline of a modest deal could come apart once financial experts come to grips with the numbers. After the summit meeting concluded, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said that he was “confident” a deal would be done by the end of the week, “for the simple reason that we have to find agreement this week.” Monday was supposed to be a crucial day on Greece for eurozone finance ministers, followed by an emergency summit meeting of European leaders from the 19 countries using the euro, expected to go late into the night. But in an apparent mix-up, Greek proposals sent to the finance ministers very early Monday were superseded by another proposal later that morning. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch minister who is chairman of the group, said the delay deprived the finance ministers and experts of the time needed to judge the Greek proposals. And there was even brief consideration given to canceling the emergency leaders’ summit. But Mr. Dijsselbloem said there was enough in the Greek proposals to provide some optimism that a real bargain might be in sight, and the leaders decided to meet anyway, even though they made clear that no major decisions would be made on Monday. But they wanted to try to make it clear to Mr. Tsipras that flexibility and patience are limited. Mr. Tsipras has said that the toughest choices can be made only by political leaders, not finance ministers or technocrats, and there is continuing suspicion among many irritated European officials that his government has been playing for time. The idea would be to increase the pressure on his European colleagues to give Athens a better deal that Mr. Tsipras can sell at home as at least a partial victory. “Frankly, it’s not a bad strategy,” a senior European Union official said. Mr. Dijsselbloem said the Greek plan was “a basis to really restart the talks again and really get a result,” although officials needed to assess whether the economic reforms proposed by Greece “are enough for the economy to take off again.” Donald Tusk , the president of the European Council, also signaled cautious optimism. “The latest Greek proposals are the first real proposals in many weeks, although they still need — it’s obvious for me — the assessment of the institutions and further work,” he told reporters. “The most important thing is that the leaders take full political responsibility for the political process to avoid the worst-case scenario, which means uncontrollable, chaotic Graccident,” said Mr. Tusk, using a voguish term for unplanned events forcing Greece out of the eurozone. Despite reassurances about the survival of the euro, the economic and political stakes for the European Union are high, and all would prefer to avoid both a Greek default and an exit from the common currency. Mr. Tsipras knows this, and analysts believe he has been stalling to try to get at least the promise of some relief for Greece’s probably unsustainable mountain of debt in a third bailout program. The last part of the existing bailout expires at the end of June; a tranche of $8.2 billion has yet to be disbursed, which has led to worries that Greece would not be able to pay the $1.8 billion it owes to the International Monetary Fund by the end of the month. According to the Greek economics minister, Giorgios Stathakis, speaking to the BBC, the Greek proposal would raise taxes on businesses and the wealthy, as well as hiking the value-added tax , or VAT, on some items. It reportedly would also raise the retirement age for state pensions gradually to 67, phasing out an early retirement system that allowed many Greeks to stop working in their early 50s. Mr. Tsipras has argued that he needs to be able to show Greeks there is at least some light at the end of the austerity tunnel. By accepting a rise in the retirement age, he can say he has preserved existing pensions for most Greeks, kept pay stable for public workers and kept the VAT down on critical items like electricity and medicine. Image Greeks favoring continued eurozone membership marched in Athens as creditors worked on a deal to secure debt relief. Credit Louisa Gouliamaki/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Greece’s creditors have complained that pensions take some 16 percent of Greece’s gross domestic product and must be reduced, and the Greek proposal reportedly includes a higher employer contribution to pensions that some experts believe will be very difficult to collect. One European Union official familiar with the Greek proposal said it would also have to pass muster in the turbulent atmosphere of Greek politics. “Looking ahead, the real risks remain located in Greek domestic politics, where government’s movement on the issues of pension and VAT reform could be a tough sell — and would be an impossible one without any concessions on debt relief,” Wolfango Piccoli, a managing director at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consultancy, wrote in a client note on Monday. Mr. Piccoli, in a telephone interview later, said any offer by negotiators and creditors to give Greece a way to ease its debt repayments was highly unlikely until the Greek proposal had been fully assessed. But if a deal takes longer, European policy makers and the European Central Bank will have to consider how to help Greece avoid imposing capital controls to curb the flight of deposits from its banking system in the event it misses the large repayment to the International Monetary Fund at the end of the month. Already, Greeks have been taking billions of euros out of Greek banks, and so far the European Central Bank has been willing to replace the money in exchange for at least notional collateral, since the bank is forbidden from deficit funding. But if the outflow continues, capital controls might have to be imposed to avoid bank failure and a sudden Greek exit from the euro, since the supply will have stopped. There are geopolitical concerns, too. Officials in both Washington and Berlin put the Greek crisis in the context of a more aggressive Russia, its annexation of Crimea and involvement in separatist regions of eastern Ukraine. Greece is a member of NATO, too, and Mr. Tsipras’s ties with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s hints of financial support for Greece and Russia’s interest in using Greece to pipe natural gas to Europe have not gone unnoticed. And most European leaders fear the potential consequences of a Greek default: a failed state in the Balkans sending tens of thousands of desperate workers north into other European Union member nations and looking to Moscow for a lifeline. But there is also a reluctance among countries that have achieved modest growth after undergoing serious austerity and structural changes to give Greece much of a pass.",

    "source": "Damon’s Home Run Lifts Yankees to Another Victory in Last At-Bat <eos> Johnny Damon placed a black and gold wrestling belt over his left shoulder, his reward for providing the climax to another frenetic game at Yankee Stadium. The toy belt was a gift to Damon last month from A. J. Burnett’s sons, Allan Jr. and Ashton, but it has evolved into a symbol of success for the Yankees . Damon possessed the belt because he hit a game-ending home run off Jesse Crain in the 10th inning on Sunday to power the Yankees to a 3-2 win over the Minnesota Twins at Yankee Stadium. Whichever player Damon deems the star of the game is allowed to hang on to the belt. Lately, the Yankees have passed it around to a bevy of late-inning heroes. Because of Damon’s home run, the Yankees recorded their third straight victory against the Twins in which they scored the decisive run in their final at-bat. The Yankees had not done that since 1972. Damon proudly held the belt Sunday, but he was ready to bequeath it to the next Yankee. “We all have faith in each other in here,” Damon said. “It doesn’t matter who it is, just as long as someone gets the job done.” Damon’s homer , along with a bullpen that followed Burnett with three and a third scoreless innings, Mark Teixeira’s slick defense and another homer from Alex Rodriguez, steered the Yankees to their fifth win in a row. The Yankees may have few fans sitting in some of their priciest seats, but they have shown why it is foolish for anyone to leave before the final out. On Saturday, Rodriguez hit a winning homer in the 11th inning, so he had the belt with Champ etched across the middle. On Friday, Melky Cabrera was awarded the belt after he won the game with a two-run single in the ninth . As they did to Rodriguez and Cabrera, Damon’s teammates slammed him in the face with a celebratory pie. “I’ll take it anytime,” Damon said. “One thing that I did figure out is whipped cream actually makes a real good hair product.” As dramatic as Damon’s homer was, the Yankees almost won in an even more dazzling manner in the ninth. With Brett Gardner on second, Francisco Cervelli scorched a ball that caromed off the glove of pitcher Jose Mijares and bounced back to catcher Joe Mauer. Mauer took a few steps toward first and lifted the ball behind his head as if he were about to throw there. But Mauer did not make the throw. He turned and saw that Gardner had not stopped at third and was rumbling for home. Mauer, who was about 40 feet in front of the plate, barreled for home, too. A former high school quarterback, Mauer dived and tagged Gardner in the midsection while blocking him from touching the plate. “He’s an All-Star player every day when he goes out on the field,” Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said of Mauer. “The athleticism that he showed to get a very speedy runner is pretty incredible.” Mauer’s play combined athleticism, instincts and smarts. “I didn’t really think I’d have to race and beat him home, but I faked to first, turned around, and he’s already halfway down the line,” Mauer said. “So I just tried to beat him to the plate.” For six innings, Burnett was the pitcher the Yankees had wanted desperately enough to invest $82.5 million in his right arm. His pulsating fastballs, diving curveballs and tough-guy attitude were on display. But this was not the offense the Yankees expected to have. Not a lineup that was lulled to sleep by Kevin Slowey, who cleverly matched every zero that Burnett put on the scoreboard. That succession of zeroes finally vanished in the seventh inning, when the Twins nicked Burnett for two runs on two hits, a walk and two wild pitches. The Yankees countered with two runs in the bottom of the inning on Rodriguez’s home run and a sacrifice fly by Cabrera. Burnett, who struck out seven and walked six in six and two-thirds innings, has not won since April 14. The Twins loaded the bases with one out in the eighth, but Brett Tomko and Teixeira stifled them. Denard Span rapped a grounder that seemed bound for right field, but Teixeira dived to his right to stab it. From his knees, he flipped the ball home for a forceout. Teixeira said he realized that he “had to do anything I could to keep that guy from scoring.” Two innings later, Damon, who is as comfortable a hitter as the Yankees have in crucial situations, shortened his swing on a 3-2 fastball and hit it into the right-field seats. Damon glided around the bases and into a sea of pinstriped players waiting at the plate. Back in the clubhouse, Damon had the belt waiting, too. “Hopefully,” he said, “there’ll be another winner tomorrow.” Inside Pitch Chien-Ming Wang is probably headed back to the Yankees after he pitched seven scoreless innings Sunday in his second consecutive shutout performance for Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. “You wonder at some point how much you’re going to get out of this stuff after a period of time,” General Manager Brian Cashman told The Scranton Times-Tribune. Brian Bruney also pitched for Scranton, allowing two hits and a run in one inning. He will probably return to the Yankees by Tuesday. TYLER KEPNER",

    "source": "Fattening Goodies in All Their Sugary Glory <eos> “Sugar Buzz” is a high-calorie, free-wheeling, almost all-female group exhibition inviting us to savor the diversity of contemporary art made of sweets, or inspired by them. Though the 40 assembled works by almost 30 artists are not terribly complicated, or edifying, they are pretty enough to look at, even vaguely nourishing — the ultimate eye candy. Walking into this exhibition you get an instant jolt — there are crazy colors everywhere, and artwork that looks like delicious cakes, pies, ice cream, biscuits, doughnuts and other diet-busters. But much like a real sugar buzz, the initial rush soon begins to wear off. Several artists have made works out of actual foodstuff. Mark Mcleod opens the exhibition with silhouetted images of famous museums burnt into tiles made of cast sugar and Splenda. Designed to change over time, the burnt-in, caramelized designs have begun to deepen and discolor. You can’t help but wonder how long they will last. Nearby is Andy Yoder’s seven-foot pipe made of black licorice Twizzlers, while in another part of the exhibition is Yoshiko Kanai’s process-oriented work consisting of a Japanese table and traditional tea set cast of sugar mixed with egg whites. Every few days the artist pours green tea and Coca-Cola into the bowls, gradually eroding them and the table. Becca Albee also makes edible art, baking dozens of Frisbee-size cakes, which she has arranged on the gallery floor in the shape of a spiral. The obvious reference is to the minimalist artist Robert Smithson’s “Spiral Jetty” (1970), a monumental earthwork on the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Remaking it in cakes seems ridiculous, though it takes a swipe at macho earth sculpture. Besides stuff made from food, there is a lot of artwork here made to look like food. It is hard to miss Amy Williamson Miller’s eight-foot slice of wedding cake, made of mixed media, and glibly titled “I Do” (2006), and Vadis Turner’s eye-fooling collection of confection and cupcakes made of colored cloth and assorted women’s beauty products. Ms. Turner has also made chocolates out of pantyhose and other fabric odds and ends. They are very cleverly done. Emily Eveleth’s painting of sugar-coated jelly doughnuts, “Repose” (2006), is one of several paintings of pastries and cakes in the show. What can be said of it? Not much, for it is basically a sensual bit of retro Pop art reminiscent (in manner rather than subject) of James Rosenquist’s glossy consumerist paintings from the 1970s, or Claes Oldenburg’s goofy soft sculptures of doughnuts and other junk food. Several other painters owe something to the work of Mr. Rosenquist, and to Wayne Thiebaud, whose paintings from the 1960s and 70s of cafeteria-type foods — cakes, pies, ice creams — and other fattening goodies set the gold standard in this area. Among them is Sara Sill, who paints delicious photorealist images of tables in French patisseries laden with cakes and pastries. Yum. The rest of the cake and sweets paintings look better as a group, much like a party with all the goodies set out on a table for guests. But on their own they are a bit disappointing. Sometimes this is because the painting technique is sloppy, and sometimes because the subject matter or the color scheme doesn’t pique the appetite. I am thinking in particular of Lynda Ray’s dull, murky encaustics that suggest slices of layer cakes. This is not a gathering of artists who specialize in making food-oriented art. It is actually a collection of artists who mostly do other things and who just happened to make an artwork or two related to sweets. They were found through an open call organized by Susan Hoeltzel, the gallery director, who sifted through hundreds of applications to settle on a final selection. One artist who does seem to work regularly with foodstuff is Shelley Miller, a Canadian. She applies colored cake frosting to building exteriors in the shape of cornices, columns and tiles, which eventually wash off in the rain and snow. Photographs of projects in Brazil and Canada are here, one of which shows street children at an installation in Brazil picking at and eating the frosting. The rest of the show is mildly amusing — more imitation cakes, installations with candy wrappers, and a cabinet stocked with collages of the artist’s favorite candies. The exhibits inspired an occasional half smile but never really roused my enthusiasm. Or maybe it was that the buzz I had experienced upon entering this colorful display was beginning to wear off.",

    "source": "Patricia C. Dunn Dies at 58; Led Hewlett-Packard During Spying Case <eos> SAN FRANCISCO — Patricia C. Dunn , who rose from a secretary to lead Barclays Global Investors and then serve as chairwoman of Hewlett-Packard only to have her career eclipsed by her involvement in an attempt to stop boardroom leaks by spying on directors, journalists and employees, died on Sunday at her home in Orinda, Calif. She was 58. The cause was ovarian cancer, her husband, William Jahnke, said. She had been treated for three types of cancer since 2002. As its chief executive, Ms. Dunn built Barclays Global Investors into the largest institutional money manager in the country; Fortune magazine ranked her among the most powerful women in business. She was later named the nonexecutive chairwoman of Hewlett-Packard after the firing of Carly Fiorina as chief executive and chairwoman in 2005. While Ms. Dunn was chairwoman of Hewlett-Packard, the company’s board became concerned about leaks of its deliberations to the press. Ms. Dunn authorized a spying operation and put it in the hands of outside investigators, who ran amok. They obtained phone records of board members, employees and journalists who wrote about the company and followed some of them. They even considered an operation to enter the San Francisco offices of The Wall Street Journal posing as a cleaning crew in order to snoop. Ms. Dunn maintained that she was a scapegoat, saying her actions had been taken with the board’s knowledge and approval. She later testified before a Congressional subcommittee that she had not directed the investigations but had been guided by the company’s lawyers. Documents submitted to the subcommittee showed that the company’s lawyers had started the operation before informing Ms. Dunn of it, although the efforts were known internally by the name of a Hawaiian resort, Kona. The lawyers told her that the phone records had been obtained legally, she said. She later resigned from the board. As a result of her role, she was indicted along with four others in California on felony charges of using false pretenses to obtain confidential information from a public utility, unauthorized access of computer data, identity theft and conspiracy. But the state dropped all charges against Ms. Dunn shortly afterward, saying the action was “in the interests of justice.” She had just learned of a recurrence of cancer. She also battled breast cancer and melanoma. “She was a really gifted businesswoman from very humble beginnings,” said a friend, Karen Kaplowitz, organizer of the Legal Momentum Aiming High awards, one of many honors Ms. Dunn received. “She rose through the ranks because she was very good at what she did.” Patricia Cecile Dunn was born on March 27, 1953, in Burbank, Calif., the daughter of a vaudeville actor and a Las Vegas showgirl. Her father died of a heart attack while she was still a girl. The family then moved to Marin County, north of San Francisco. Her mother later died of breast cancer. Ms. Dunn attended the University of Oregon before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley, where she graduated in 1975 with a degree in journalism. After briefly working for a community newspaper in San Francisco, she was hired as a secretary for Wells Fargo Investment Advisers (which became Barclays Global), then rose through the ranks as she earned a reputation as an ace saleswoman. She was among the first women to run a large investment management company in the United States, and she introduced an index fund and other computer-intensive quantitative investment management techniques in wide use today. Her most important accomplishment there was the creation of Exchange-Traded Funds, which despite initial resistance from the firm’s corporate parent became a highly lucrative product. E.T.F.’s are a basket of stocks that reflect the industry category or an index. Besides Mr. Jahnke, her husband of 30 years and the former chief executive of Wells Fargo Investment Advisers, Ms. Dunn is survived by their two daughters, Janai Brengman and Michelle Cox; a son, Michael Jahnke; a brother, Paul Dunn; a sister, Debbie Lammers; and 10 grandchildren.",

    "source": "Construction Halted Ahead of Games <eos> BEIJING — City officials laid out an ambitious series of measures on Monday that will freeze construction projects, slow down steel production and shut down quarries in and around this capital during the summer in an attempt to clear the air for the Olympics. Even spray-painting outdoors will be banned during the weeks before and after sporting events, which begin here on Aug. 8. Although officials initially suggested that the city’s wholesale transformation would be complete long before the opening ceremonies, the announcement nonetheless represents the most detailed plan yet for how Beijing might reach its longstanding pledge to stage “green Games” in one of the world’s most polluted cities. In the past, officials had suggested that the city’s makeover would be completed well before the Games, possibly by the end of 2007. But the two-month construction ban announced Monday will instead begin on July 20. Government directives will also force coal-burning power plants to reduce their emissions by 30 percent through most of the summer. Officials said 19 heavily polluting enterprises, including steel mills, coke plants and refineries, would be temporarily mothballed or forced to reduce production. Gas pumps that do not have vapor-trapping devices will be closed, cement production will stop and the use of toxic solvents outdoors will be forbidden. If Beijing’s air remains unacceptably sullied in the days leading up the Games, officials said, they would take “stringent steps” to curb polluting industries, although they declined to say what those might be. “We will do everything possible to honor the promise,” Du Shaozhong, deputy director of the city’s Environmental Protection Bureau, told reporters. “Just tell everybody they don’t have to worry.” Some Olympic officials and athletes remain unpersuaded. Although the government has made notable strides in reducing the brown haze from coal-burning heaters and stoves, the unabated surge in car ownership has erased many of those gains. There are about 3.5 million vehicles choking Beijing’s roadways, with about 1,200 new cars joining the honking parade each day. Last August, in a four-day exercise that will probably be repeated this summer, authorities forced more than half of Beijing’s cars and trucks off the road. Officials said they would present plans to restrict traffic later. In recent months, independent scientists who have sampled Beijing’s air have said levels of ozone and particulate matter from diesel engines remain five times as high as maximum standards set by the World Health Organization. The president of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, said a particularly smoggy day could prompt officials to postpone outdoor endurance events. Mr. Du, the environmental official, dismissed suggestions that Beijing had failed to substantially reduce harmful pollution. He said that the number of Blue Sky days, those with acceptably clean air according to the city’s monitoring system, has more than doubled since 1998. There were just 100 such days then, he said, compared with 246 last year. He said levels of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide had dropped significantly in recent years. However, an independent study released in January by an American environmental consultant, Steven Q. Andrews, found irregularities in the monitoring system that cast doubt as to how much air quality had actually improved. The authorities said they had reduced pollution by forcing local factories to upgrade pollution-control equipment and compelling about 200 of the most hopelessly noxious ones to shut down for good. Even on a day when the horizon was notably hazy and the fumes from idling cars undeniably acrid, Mr. Du urged a roomful of reporters to tell the public how much better Beijing’s air had become in recent years. “Please assure all the athletes,” he said. But even if they find the city’s air cleaner than expected, visitors may be disappointed by the indoor environment. Earlier in the day, government officials announced that a proposed smoking ban, which is to take effect on May 1, had been modified in the face of opposition by business owners. Smoking will be restricted in hospitals, schools and stadiums, but it will be permitted in bars and restaurants.",

    "source": "Deacon Jones, Fearsome N.F.L. Defensive End, Dies at 74 <eos> Deacon Jones, a prototype of the pass-rushing defensive end who became a master of the sack and one of the National Football League’s greatest defensive players with the Los Angeles Rams’ line known as the Fearsome Foursome, died on Monday in Anaheim Hills, Calif. He was 74. His death was announced by the Washington Redskins through their general manager, Bruce Allen, whose father, George Allen, coached Jones with the Rams and the Redskins. Jones had been treated for lung cancer and heart problems, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in September 2009. Jones told the newspaper then that he had undergone lung surgery and had a pacemaker installed the previous May. Jones was a 14th-round draft pick from a historically black college, and he arrived in the N.F.L. when offensive players garnered most of the headlines. But in his 14 seasons, he parlayed his strength, his agility and his size — 6 feet 5 inches and 270 pounds or so — to glamorize defensive play. He pounded opposing quarterbacks, rolling up dozens of sacks, and he popularized the head slap to dominate offensive linemen. He was selected six times to the All-Pro team and played in eight Pro Bowls. He was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1980 and was one of three defensive ends on the all-N.F.L. 75th anniversary team selected in 1994 by a vote by members of the news media and league personnel. Image Deacon Jones parlayed his size — 6 feet 5 inches and 270 pounds or so — his strength and his agility to glamorize defensive play. Credit Associated Press The Rams had only one winning season from 1963 to 1966, the span in which all the members of the Fearsome Foursome were teammates. But Jones became a marquee figure — sometimes called the Secretary of Defense — playing left end alongside tackle Merlin Olsen, who was also chosen for the 75th anniversary team, in a line that also included right tackle Roosevelt Grier, who was known as Rosey, and right end Lamar Lundy. Lundy died in 2007 and Olsen in 2010. Jones’s death leaves Grier, 80, as the last survivor of the group. “He had that head slap move, the constant energy, the incredible speed and the nonstop will,” Sonny Jurgensen, a Hall of Fame quarterback, told The Post-Dispatch in September 2009 when the St. Louis Rams, the successor franchise to Jones’s team, retired Jones’s No. 75. Jurgensen remembered an encounter with Jones late in a game when the Rams were leading his Redskins by 11 points. “He comes in on a pass rush and fell down. He starts crawling on all fours trying to get to me. He’s crawling in the dirt like it was the most important play in the world, and I look at him and said, ‘Jeez-us, Deacon, it ain’t the Super Bowl.’ But that’s how much he cared.” David Jones was born on Dec. 9, 1938, in Eatonville, Fla., where an incident he witnessed as a youngster remained seared in his psyche and fueled his determination to escape from a dead-end life in the segregationist South. After Sunday church services, members of an all-black congregation were mingling on a lawn when white teenagers in a passing car heaved a watermelon at the group. It hit an elderly woman in the head. “I was maybe 14 years old, but I chased that car until my breath ran out,” Jones told The San Diego Union-Tribune in 1999. “I could hear them laughing.” Image Jones, right in 1964, with the rest of the Rams’ Fearsome Foursome: Lamar Lundy, left, Merlin Olsen and Roosevelt Grier. Credit NFL Photos, via Associated Press The woman died of her injuries a few days later, but there was no police investigation, as Jones remembered it. “Unlike many black people then, I was determined not to be what society said I was,” he said. “Thank God I had the ability to play a violent game like football. It gave me an outlet for the anger in my heart.” Jones played football at South Carolina State and Mississippi Vocational — now known as Mississippi Valley State, the alma mater of the Hall of Fame receiver Jerry Rice — before joining the Rams. He was known as D. J. in college, but when he arrived in the N.F.L., he sought something more distinctive and called himself Deacon, having met Deacon Dan Towler, an outstanding Rams fullback of the 1950s and one of professional football’s early black stars, who became a minister. Jones said he believed he would have been the career sacks leader in the N.F.L. — surpassing Bruce Smith’s 200 — if individual sack totals were tallied in his era. They did not become an official statistic until 1982. John Turney, a member of the Pro Football Researchers Association who pored over play-by-play accounts of games played long ago and studied game tape at NFL Films, concluded that Jones had 173 1/2 sacks. But Jones said that his total was well above that. Image Deacon Jones in 2010. Credit David Livingston/Getty Images Jones has been credited with coining the term “sack.” But the statistician Seymour Siwoff of the Elias Sports Bureau once told The Kansas City Star that in the early 1960s, when he began compiling team statistics on getting to the quarterback, the N.F.L. publicist Jim Kensil invented the term. However murky the origin of the term, Jones clearly made the sack his trademark, playing for the Rams from 1961 to 1971, the San Diego Chargers (1972-73) and the Redskins (1974). Jones’s survivors include his wife, Elizabeth, and a stepson, Greg Pinto, The Los Angeles Times reported. After retiring from football, Jones broadcast for the Rams on radio, acted on television, did Miller Lite beer commercials and created the Deacon Jones Foundation, based in Anaheim Hills, which provides college expenses for poor students in return for their going back to their communities for volunteer work. Jones took pride in that, but he did not want anyone to forget his more ferocious calling. In an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1999, he provided his imagery of the sack: “You take all the offensive linemen and put them in a burlap bag, and then you take a baseball bat and beat on the bag. You’re sacking them, you’re bagging them. And that’s what you’re doing with a quarterback.” As for his bullying of offensive linemen: “The head slap was not my invention, but Rembrandt, of course, did not invent painting. The quickness of my hands and the length of my arms, it was perfect for me. It was the greatest thing I ever did, and when I left the game, they outlawed it.”",

    "source": "Storm Brings Rain and Relief to Much of Texas <eos> HOUSTON — Tropical Storm Edouard crawled ashore on the Texas coast between Galveston and the Louisiana border on Tuesday morning, causing heavy rain and some flash floods in East Texas but no serious damage, officials said. Many residents were relieved when the storm failed to gain strength overnight as some had feared. Then it turned north away from Galveston and Houston and made landfall between the coastal town of High Island and Sabine Pass, its eye passing over the McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge. Meteorologists say the storm never reached hurricane-force winds of 74 miles per hour, in part because it came ashore sooner than expected and did not have a chance to build up over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. “We were prepared for a little worse than this,” said Don Oettinger, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Dickinson, Tex. “It wasn’t out of the question that it would become a hurricane.” Some officials said the rain was welcome, as Texas has been suffering a heat wave and drought. Others said that the four to six inches of rain the storm brought might cause rivers to crest in the coming days but that there was no immediate danger of major floods. Power went out in isolated pockets around the East Texas cities of Port Arthur, Anahuac and Beaumont. Winds of about 65 m.p.h. knocked down trees and limbs there, and flash floods briefly closed sections of Interstate 10 in the morning. But no major damage was reported. “All in all, we fared pretty well,” said John Owens, deputy police chief in Port Arthur. Greg Fountain, the emergency management coordinator in Jefferson County, where the center of the storm passed, said it had caused no more trouble than an average thunderstorm, nothing like the chaos produced by Hurricane Humberto last year. “We feel very fortunate,” Mr. Fountain said. Harris County, encompassing Houston, reported minor damage from the wind and rain, which covered the skies in a misty gray canopy. It was a measure of the storm’s weakness that both major airports, George Bush Intercontinental and Hobby, remained open, though there were long delays. In Galveston, where hurricanes have a long and deadly history, a few surfers took to the water to take advantage of the storm waves, and some people rode bikes on the beach. Steady rain fell, but winds gusted only to 20 m.p.h. “It’s a blessing that we missed it,” said Charlie Kelly, the Galveston emergency management coordinator. “It was a good drill for us. We dodged a bullet on this one.” Tourists ventured out after midmorning, many expressing relief that their vacations had not been ruined. The storm skirted the Louisiana coast on its way to Texas, raising tides and flooding bayous and yards in the communities of Dulac and Chauvin. Some residents near the Intracoastal Waterway in Cameron Parish, bordering Texas, were told to evacuate. The storm promised to bring some relief to the residents of Dallas, who suffered through a 12th day of temperatures above 100 degrees, weather that has been blamed for four deaths. Residents are focused on the cooling to come, with forecasts for the weekend in the mere high 90s. “Even though it’s hot, the red flags are not waving as rapidly as they’ve been,” said Sherrie Lopez, public information officer for Dallas Fire-Rescue.",

    "source": "Corruption Scandal Leads to a Big Loss for Petrobras <eos> RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s state-run oil company Petrobras said Wednesday that it lost $2.1 billion in an eight-year kickback scheme that saw the firm’s executives taking bribes for awarding inflated contracts to suppliers. The company released its long-delayed fourth-quarter financial results that included a write down of 6.2 billion reais — about $2.1 billion. It attributed the losses to a series of inflated contracts and other graft during the scheme it says ran from 2004 to 2012. Releasing the audited results was the first step for Petrobras to try to regain investor confidence and access to international credit markets, which the debt-plagued company desperately needs to develop huge offshore oil fields discovered in recent years. The company was cut to junk status by Moody’s Investors Service in late February in large part because of the scandal. The U.S.-based Eurasia Group said in a research note after the Petrobras results were published that “attention will now shift to measures that will bolster the company’s course correction in the longer-term.” “Since earlier this year, a set of more favorable policies and measures have been taking shape, beginning with a change in the company’s leadership, and the decision to overhaul the company’s board of advisers by removing political appointees and replacing them with more business-friendly names,” the note said. Evan Sponagle, an energy consultant based in Rio de Janeiro, said releasing the audited results would give banks “a reason to start lending again” to not just Petrobras but to Brazil’s entire oil industry, which has been frozen under the cloud of the corruption investigation. Federal prosecutors say the probe has uncovered the largest graft scheme ever uncovered in Brazil. They also stress that they are still investigating and the case is widening, with dozens of top business executives along with federal congressmen and other political figures facing charges, under investigation or already sitting in jail. Investigators say the scheme saw Brazil’s top construction and engineering companies pay bribes to a handful of Petrobras’s politically appointed executives in return for winning inflated contracts. Prosecutors allege some of the money then flowed into the campaign coffers of the governing Workers’ Party and its allies, which they deny. In addition to the dozens of executives who have been charged in the case, the Attorney General’s Office last month said it was investigating over 50 political figures, including 21 federal deputies and 12 congressmen, for alleged participation in the graft. Included among those under investigation are the leaders of both houses of congress. So far, President Dilma Rousseff, who was chairwoman of the Petrobras board during most of the years the scheme played out, has not been implicated in the case. She has expressed strong support for the investigation and for holding the guilty accountable. But the investigation creeped closer to Ms. Rousseff after the arrest earlier this month of her Workers’ Party treasurer, Joao Vaccari, who is charged with money laundering for allegedly taking in money connected to the Petrobras kickback scheme. On Wednesday, a federal judge handed down sentences to two of the main figures in the case, giving the former Petrobras executive Paulo Roberto Costa over seven years in prison and the scheme’s top money bagman, Alberto Yousseff, over nine years. Both can appeal the ruling.",

    "source": "After Paul Falters, Backers Push Agenda in Party and Other Races <eos> WASHINGTON — Armed with an inherited fortune and a devotion to Ron Paul , John Ramsey, a 21-year-old college student from Nacogdoches, Tex., plunged into a little-watched Republican House primary in Northern Kentucky this spring to promote his version of freedom. More than $560,000 later, Mr. Ramsey’s chosen standard-bearer, Thomas H. Massie, a Republican, cruised to victory Tuesday in the race to select a successor to Representative Geoff Davis, a Republican who is retiring. The saturation advertising campaign waged by Mr. Ramsey’s “ super PAC ,” Liberty for All , may be the most visible manifestation of a phenomenon catching the attention of Republicans from Maine to Nevada . With their favorite having lost the nomination for president, Mr. Paul’s dedicated band of youthful supporters is looking down-ballot and swarming lightly guarded Republican redoubts like state party conventions in an attempt to infiltrate the top echelons of the party. “ Karl Rove ’s fear-and-smear-style Republicans are going to wake up at the end of the year and realize we are now in control of the Republican Party ,” said Preston Bates, a Democrat-turned-Paulite who is running Liberty for All for Mr. Ramsey. In Minnesota , Paulites stormed the Republican gathering in St. Cloud last weekend, bumping aside two conventional Republican candidates to choose one of their own, Kurt P. Bills, a high school economics teacher, to challenge Senator Amy Klobuchar , a Democrat, this fall. Backers of Mr. Paul, a Republican congressman from Texas , crashed Republican conventions in Iowa , Maine, Minnesota and Nevada in recent weeks, snatching up the lion’s share of delegate slots for the Republican National Convention in Tampa this August, a potential headache for the national party and its presumptive nominee, Mitt Romney . And Paulite candidates for Congress are sprouting up from Florida to Virginia to Colorado , challenging sitting Republicans and preaching the gospel of radically smaller government, an end to the Federal Reserve, restraints on Bush-era antiterrorism laws and a pullback from foreign military adventures. “I’d call it a strict constitutional approach,” said Senator Rand Paul , Republican of Kentucky and Ron Paul’s son. “And I think it’s spreading.” Republican Party officials say they are in daily contact with Representative Paul, in a delicate effort to harness the energy around him without inciting his supporters. “We have had open dialogue with Dr. Paul and his campaign to ensure we are all focused on winning in November,” said Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee ’s communications director. Mr. Ramsey said that other Paul supporters had brought the Kentucky race to his attention and that he would spend whatever it takes “to get this country moving in a freer direction.” “How much money would you spend for freedom?” he asked Tuesday, after buying airtime from Lexington to Louisville with money he inherited from his grandfather in 2010 as he was being pulled into the libertarian orbit of Mr. Paul. He met Mr. Bates on the Paul campaign, and in March they incorporated Liberty for All with nearly $1 million of Mr. Ramsey’s money. More than half of it went into Kentucky’s Fourth District in a whoosh of advertising. The impact has been significant. Mr. Massie, the Lewis County judge executive and an engineer trained at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , said he opened the seven-way Republican primary with a lead. But he lost it after Mr. Davis and former Senator Jim Bunning backed one of his rivals, Alecia Webb-Edgington. Then small advertising buys from two other candidates pummeled him with negative accusations. The sprawling Fourth District of Kentucky presents competitors with a challenge. To reach all its voters, a candidate must advertise in four media markets in Kentucky and Ohio . Mr. Massie acknowledged that he could not do that, but that Liberty for All could. Soon, the advertising for his rivals was drowned out by attacks on his behalf. “They owned the airwaves, everything from the Food Channel to Court TV,” he said of the PAC. The Ramsey money does not have a clear path from Kentucky, but Liberty for All appears to have a taste for the obscure. Its next candidate is Michael D. Cargill, a gay, black gun store owner running for constable in Travis County, Tex. But the political action committee will have money to spend. Mr. Ramsey said that between his wallet and a fund-raising push, the PAC expected to have $10 million this summer. As they were nominating Mr. Bills at the Minnesota Republican Convention, the Paul forces also seized 12 of the state’s 13 Republican National Convention delegate slots. In Maine, they took 21 of the 24 slots. In Nevada, they grabbed 22 of the 28. The strategy of crashing state conventions has secured Mr. Paul large slates of delegates in Alaska , Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana and Missouri , as well. Such delegates are not considered a threat to the Romney nomination. But they could be vocal advocates for Mr. Paul’s libertarian views on issues like the war in Afghanistan , the Patriot Act and terrorist detainee policies, which overlap some with Tea Party views but do not mirror them. And lightly regarded Paulites running for Congress could become forces with the right amount of money. Tisha Casida, an independent in Colorado, is running against Representative Scott Tipton. Calen Fretts is chipping away at Representative Jeff Miller in Florida’s Panhandle, and Karen Kwiatkowski is challenging Representative Robert W. Goodlatte in Virginia. “I think there’s a great movement going on in this country,” said Ms. Casida, who said she was pulled into politics by Mr. Paul’s message and the red tape she faced trying to open a local farmer’s market.",

    "source": "The Mood Always Matters, So Restore Confidence First <eos> HIGH deficits and a declining economy will limit the hand of the new president in many matters of economic policy. Health care reform usually proves more expensive than promised, and voters are in no mood for higher gasoline or energy taxes. Still, President-elect Barack Obama faces the very important task of restoring confidence in our nation’s economy. He will need to appear calm and purposive, and to articulate to the American people the underlying economic strengths. Even if some of this is wishful thinking, there is a chance that positive attitudes will improve the reality on the ground. Over the last several months, the Bush administration has mishandled this issue. Most of all, the “Paulson plan” to bail out the economy was not executed gracefully. The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., warned the nation that something terrible would happen if the plan were not passed; that terrified both Wall Street and Main Street. The early version of the plan would have given the Treasury secretary almost unlimited powers, without checks and balances on his decisions. The market took that extreme proposal as a sign that the situation was truly dire. After the scare came indecisiveness. Whether or not the Paulson plan was a good idea, no one articulated how it would work or why it was needed. The initial plan was then dumped for a successor plan — laden with Congressional pork, by the way — and then this second plan turned out to be less important, after it was passed, than the need for an immediate recapitalization of the banking system. Along the way it was never clear what Congress favored or why, and the regulators appeared to be stumbling from one crisis to the next, scaring the American public along the way. Political uncertainty hardly caused the crisis, but politics made it much worse. EVEN if you believe the dubious proposition that an initial scare was needed to pass legislation, the time has come to patch up confidence. The federal government lacked a commanding presence during the early stages of the financial crisis . Rebuilding confidence might seem a small matter, but it is not. The truth is this: America is a wonderful and magnanimous nation when it is a winner, but Americans are not used to losing and Americans are not used to panic. Often we respond to negative events badly, so we need to be especially careful when we are in a losing or risky position. Very bad events can cause a panic among the citizenry or its leaders, which translates into subsequent bad decisions. For a classic example of a negative policy dynamic, look at 9/11. The United States lost 3,000 lives and a great deal of wealth and confidence. The government then took actions, most of all the Iraq war, which led to even greater losses. We are in danger of getting stuck in another negative dynamic, but this time in the realm of economics. We might follow up the financial crisis with some worse responses and policies. It’s not just the country’s future that is on the line. Despite the commonality of anti-American rhetoric, the United States sets the tone for much of the world. If America is seen as turning the corner and stabilizing its economy, that will be a positive cue for many other countries. The notion of a downward spiral of ideas and events is not unprecedented. Starting in the early part of the 20th century, the West experienced one awful event after another, including a world war, a flu pandemic and a major depression. The response was a global spread of totalitarian ideas, a loss of confidence in democracy and capitalism and, eventually, another war. While today’s world is far from this point, there is a small chance that we will move in an unstable and worsening direction. Steering away from it should be a priority for the next president. Rebuilding confidence won’t be easy. If our next president seems flip or overconfident, observers will be skeptical above all else. Denying our basic economic problems will erode credibility, but those problems — most of all our debt and a collapsed financial sector — need to be acknowledged in a way that shows a path forward. We need to avoid overreaction at the same time we need to return to feeling in control.",

    "source": "Perez Struggles Again as Mets Revert to Bad Habits <eos> Mets Manager Jerry Manuel lacked the assurance he carried earlier. In the fifth inning Sunday, he walked to the mound with purpose, that purpose being to yank the struggling Oliver Perez. But afterward, Manuel seemed less sure of himself when discussing Perez’s immediate future. “I don’t know what we do,” Manuel said. “It’s something that has us concerned. It has me concerned. I’ll put it that way. I’m concerned. I’m not going to come out and make a decision with the mood I’m in at this point.” His mood and that of the 40,023 at Citi Field soured while watching Perez’s performance in a listless 8-1 loss to the Washington Nationals . On a sun-splashed afternoon, the Mets displayed all of their early-season miscues. They played two productive games against the Nationals this series, then relapsed. Perez again failed to emerge from the fifth inning, the Washington rookie Jordan Zimmermann stiff-armed an anemic offense, Daniel Murphy continued his erratic play in left field and Carlos Beltran rekindled memories of last week’s nonslide. After the Mets returned home with a four-game losing streak, Manuel said he would give his starting pitchers one more turn through the rotation before assessing possible changes. Strong performances by Johan Santana and Mike Pelfrey briefly camouflaged anxieties, but Perez’s performance in allowing the Nationals their first road victory only magnified them. The bottom half of the Nationals’ lineup unnerved Perez, and Jesus Flores and Austin Kearns tagged him for home runs . Perez departed to boos after four and a third innings, allowing seven runs on nine hits and three walks. Perez has pitched through the fifth inning in just one of his four starts. As Zimmermann, Perez’s counterpart, walked to the plate in the fifth, Manuel had seen enough and called for Casey Fossum. Perez had just allowed three consecutive hits, including Kearns’s home run to straightaway center field. Flores’s homer came in the second inning, after another Murphy fielding gaffe. The occasional misplay by Murphy, a converted left fielder, is becoming routine, and Kearns’s shot spun him like a corkscrew. Murphy fell to the ground on the play, which was generously ruled a double. “I was able to turn,” Murphy said. “I just lost my footing, and hopefully it won’t happen again.” Perez (1-2) entered with a 7.80 earned run average, which ballooned to 9.31. In 19 1/3 innings, Perez has allowed 20 earned runs. Now, Manuel and Omar Minaya, the Mets’ general manager, will decide what to do with Perez. He still has minor league options, but because of his tenure, he must first accept any assignment. He can also be demoted to the bullpen. “They have a decision,” Perez said. “I haven’t been doing my job, and I feel bad for that.” In his six-plus seasons, Perez has been known to pitch well against quality teams and struggle against weaker opposition. “I haven’t seen the stuff,” Manuel said. “That’s what really concerns me at this point.” He added, “And not to have the stuff and not to have command, that’s a recipe for disaster.” So was the pairing of the Mets’ offense against Zimmermann. His fastball resided in the mid-90s through much of his five and a third innings, and he struck out five and allowed six hits. Beltran said the scouting report the Mets had received stated that Zimmermann had trouble locating his pitches, but that was not the case Sunday. The Mets fared no better with Zimmermann out of the game. They were limited to one walk by Mike Hinckley, Garrett Mock and Kip Wells in three and two-thirds innings of relief. The Mets’ only run came in the first inning, when a rare Carlos Delgado triple scored Beltran. In the third, Beltran was thrown out trying to steal second base when he pulled up without sliding. “I heard contact with the bat, and I went to look at where the ball was,” said Beltran, who last Tuesday failed to slide on a close play at home in a loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. “Basically, I got surprised at second base. It was a mistake.” Manuel said: “I told him in that situation you have to slide. Regardless, you have to get down, and he understood that.” Meanwhile, David Wright continued to struggle. He struck out three times, and leads the National League with 23 strikeouts in 18 games. He also grounded out weakly in his final at-bat. His throwing error on Justin Maxwell’s infield hit prolonged the fifth inning, when the Nationals sent nine hitters to the plate and scored four runs. When asked if Wright needed a day off, Manuel offered a long exhale. “I think I need one,” he said. INSIDE PITCH The Mets designated the left-handed reliever Casey Fossum for assignment and called up Ken Takahashi from Class AAA Buffalo. Takahashi, a 40-year-old rookie from Japan, had a 0.77 E.R.A. in 11 2/3 innings. ... Jerry Manuel said he would probably rest Carlos Delgado for the first time this season in Wednesday’s series finale against Florida. ... Mark Sanchez, the Jets’ first-round draft pick, is scheduled to throw out the ceremonial first pitch before Monday night’s Marlins-Mets game at Citi Field.",

    "source": "Opposition Parties Concede Defeat in Myanmar <eos> BANGKOK — The main military-backed party won an overwhelming victory in the first election in 20 years in Myanmar , according to international news agency reports from inside the country, in a vote that was carefully engineered by the military to assure its continued grip on power. Although there has been no government announcement, officials of the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party claimed victory with 80 percent of the vote, according to the reports from Myanmar, and the leaders of the two main opposition parties conceded defeat. The outcome had been a foregone conclusion, with the election rules slanted to favor two military-backed parties and with opposition parties each contesting only a small fraction of the seats. As the votes were being counted, Myanmar Army troops battled ethnic Karen rebels who had taken over the post office and police station in the border town of Myawaddy. As many as 20,000 refugees have fled across a river into Thailand since the fighting broke out Sunday, but the violence appeared to have died down Tuesday and the refugees were returning home. More than a dozen people were reported to have been wounded, a few of them in Thailand, by stray gunfire and rockets. The election was widely seen as an attempt to legitimize military rule behind a mask of civilian government, after a half century of unambiguous military rule in the former Burma. The National League for Democracy, headed by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, declined to take part, saying campaign rules were undemocratic and unfair. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party won the last election , in 1990, but the military annulled the result and clung to power. She has been held under house arrest for most of the last 20 years. Her latest term of house arrest expires on Saturday, and there is a possibility that the junta will free her now that the election is over. International reaction was sharply split between Myanmar’s big neighbor and supporter, China, and Western nations that have pursued a policy of isolation and sanctions against Myanmar. China praised the election on Tuesday, one day after the United States and the United Nations issued strong statements condemning it. Yet, Myanmar’s neighbors in Southeast Asia, which have wavered between acceptance and criticism of the ruling junta, also welcomed the election. On Monday, President Obama said , “It is unacceptable to steal elections, as the regime in Burma has done again for all the world to see.” In a statement, the secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, said the vote was “insufficiently inclusive, participatory and transparent.” The fighting on the border was a reminder of a civil war with a number of ethnic groups that has raged in remote mountains and jungles, far from the politics that consume the cities, since Burma won independence from Britain in 1948. Continuing unrest in parts of the minority ethnic areas led the government to exclude about 1.5 million people from the election. The people fleeing into the Thai border town of Mae Sot were the latest wave of refugees who have sought safety over the years in camps along the border. Thai officials said they would be sent back when the situation returned to normal. By Tuesday, the government appeared to have taken control, and the fighting had subsided to smaller clashes along the river, including the area of Three Pagoda Pass, according to reports from the border. At least five Thai villagers were wounded when rocket-propelled grenades landed near Mae Sot, the Thai military said. The Irrawaddy, a Thailand-based magazine with contacts in Myanmar, reported that as many as 20 people were wounded in Myawaddy and that some may have been killed. The attackers were a breakaway group of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, which has given up a longstanding demand for independence and is now seeking autonomy under the umbrella of the national government. Like some other ethnic-based groups, it has reached a cease-fire with government forces. But many in these groups are angry at attempts by the military to absorb them into a border guard force, and the current fighting could be linked to that grievance.",

    "source": "U.S. Adviser’s Blunt Memo on Iraq: Time ‘to Go Home’ <eos> WASHINGTON — A senior American military adviser in Baghdad has concluded in an unusually blunt memo that Iraqi forces suffer from entrenched deficiencies but are now able to protect the Iraqi government, and that it is time “for the U.S. to declare victory and go home.” The memo offers a look at tensions that emerged between Iraqi and American military officers at a sensitive moment when American combat troops met a June 30 deadline to withdraw from Iraq ’s cities, the first step toward an advisory role. The Iraqi government’s forceful moves to assert authority have concerned some American officers, though senior American officials insisted that cooperation had improved. Prepared by Col. Timothy R. Reese , an adviser to the Iraqi military’s Baghdad command, the memorandum details Iraqi military weaknesses in scathing language, including corruption, poor management and the inability to resist Shiite political pressure. Extending the American military presence beyond August 2010, he argues, will do little to improve the Iraqis’ military performance while fueling growing resentment of Americans. “As the old saying goes, ‘Guests, like fish, begin to smell after three days,’ ” Colonel Reese wrote. “Since the signing of the 2009 Security Agreement, we are guests in Iraq, and after six years in Iraq, we now smell bad to the Iraqi nose.” Those conclusions are not shared by the senior American commander in Iraq, Gen. Ray Odierno , and his recommendation for an accelerated troop withdrawal is at odds with the timetable approved by President Obama . A spokeswoman for General Odierno said that the memo did not reflect the official stance of the United States military and was not intended for a broad audience, and that some of the problems the memo referred to had been solved since its writing in early July. Still, the memo opens a rare window into a debate among American military officers about how active the American role should be in Iraq and for how long. While some in the military endorse Colonel Reese’s assessment, other officers say that American forces need to stay in Iraq for the next couple of years as the Iraqis struggle with heightened tensions between the Kurds and Arabs, insurgent attacks in and around Mosul and checking authoritarian tendencies of the Iraqi government. “We now have an Iraqi government that has gained its balance and thinks it knows how to ride the bike in the race,” Colonel Reese wrote. “And in fact they probably do know how to ride, at least well enough for the road they are on against their current competitors. Our hand on the back of the seat is holding them back and causing resentment. We need to let go before we both tumble to the ground.” Before deploying to Iraq, Colonel Reese served as the director of the Combat Studies Institute at Fort Leavenworth , Kan., the Army’s premier intellectual center. He was an author of an official Army history of the Iraq war — “ On Point II ” — that was sharply critical of the lapses in postwar planning. As an adviser to the Baghdad Operations Command, which is led by an Iraqi general, Abud Qanbar, Colonel Reese drew examples from Baghdad Province, which is less volatile than the area near Mosul in northern Iraq, where the Sunni insurgency is strongest. But he noted that he had read military reports from other regions and that he believed that there were similar dynamics nationwide. Colonel Reese, who could not be reached for comment, submitted his paper to General Odierno’s command, but copies have circulated among active-duty and retired military officers and been posted on at least one military-oriented Web site . Colonel Reese’s memo lists a number of problems that have emerged since the withdrawal of American combat troops from Baghdad, completed June 30. They include, he wrote, a “sudden coolness” to American advisers and the “forcible takeover” of a checkpoint in the Green Zone. Iraqi units, he added, are much less willing to conduct joint operations with their American counterparts “to go after targets the U.S. considers high value.” The Iraqi Ground Forces Command, Colonel Reese wrote, has imposed “unilateral restrictions” on American military operations that “violate the most basic aspects” of the security agreement that governs American and Iraqi military relations. “The Iraqi legal system in the Rusafa side of Baghdad has demonstrated a recent willingness to release individuals originally detained by the U.S. for attacks on the U.S.,” he added. A spokeswoman for General Odierno, Lt. Col. Josslyn Aberle, said of the memo: “The e-mail reflects one person’s personal view at the time we were first implementing the Security Agreement post-30 June. Since that time many of the initial issues have been resolved and our partnerships with Iraqi Security Forces and G.O.I. partners now are even stronger than before 30 June.” G.O.I. is the abbreviation for the government of Iraq; the Iraqi Security Forces are sometimes referred to as the I.S.F. Colonel Reese appears to have anonymously circulated a less detailed version of his memo on a blog called “ The Enchanter’s Corner .” The author, listed on the site as “Tim the Enchanter,” is described as an active-duty Army officer serving as an adviser in Iraq who is “passionate about political issues.” That post on Iraq, along with one criticizing President Obama’s health care proposals , has been removed but can be found in cached versions. Under the plan developed by General Odierno, the vast majority of the approximately 130,000 American forces in Iraq will remain through Iraq’s national elections, which are expected to be held next January. After the elections and the formation of a new Iraqi government, there will be rapid reductions in American forces. By the end of August 2010, the United States would have no more than 50,000 troops in Iraq, which would include six brigades whose primary role would be to advise and train Iraqi troops. Some experts, like Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former adviser to Gen. David H. Petraeus , have argued that this timetable may be too fast “Renewed violence in Iraq is not inevitable, but it is a serious risk,” Mr. Biddle wrote in a recent paper . “The most effective option for prevention is to go slow in drawing down the U.S. military presence in Iraq. Measures to maximize U.S. leverage on important Iraqi leaders — especially Maliki,” he added, referring to Iraq’s prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki “— can be helpful in steering Iraqis away from confrontation and violence, but U.S. leverage is a function of U.S. presence.” During a recent appearance at the United States Institute of Peace , a Washington-based research organization, Mr. Maliki appeared to be contemplating a possible role for American forces after the December 2011 deadline for the removal of all American troops under the security agreement. But while General Odierno has drawn up detailed plans for a substantial advisory role, Colonel Reese argued in favor of a more limited — and shorter — effort, and recommended that all American forces be withdrawn by August 2010. “If there ever was a window where the seeds of a professional military culture could have been implanted, it is now long past,” he wrote. “U.S. combat forces will not be here long enough or with sufficient influence to change it. The military culture of the Baathist -Soviet model under Saddam Hussein remains entrenched and will not change. The senior leadership of the I.S.F. is incapable of change in the current environment.”",

    "source": "Brooklyn Bridge Park Settles Housing Lawsuit <eos> The Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation has settled a lawsuit brought last summer by a community group, allowing park officials to begin to move forward with the final phase of their development plan. The group, People for Green Space Foundation, had argued that the park corporation, which oversees development of both the park’s public spaces and commercial real estate, had modified its original plan, principally by including affordable housing in two towers long planned for Pier 6, near Atlantic Avenue. Mayor Bill de Blasio last summer announced that 30 percent of the units in the towers would be set aside as affordable. The changes, People for Green Space argued, required a new environmental review and an application to amend the plan. In the settlement, filed on Wednesday in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, the group was denied the environmental review, but it prevailed in its demand that the park corporation formally amend its plan. Building luxury housing along the park’s edge was contentious from the start. But the park was predicated on such development. (A residential-and-hotel complex is under construction at the opposite end of the park near Pier 1.) The park is expensive to maintain since it consists of several piers that are subject to wind, tides and marine organisms. Frank Carone, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the park corporation must hold public hearings on any amendment to the plan. Ultimately, he added, the Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency with some oversight of the park corporation, will then “affirm, deny or modify” the amendment. “Now, community folks, interested parties and experts can testify and be heard in a fair process whereby all evidence will be considered,” Mr. Carone said. The group that brought the lawsuit had argued that the inclusion of affordable housing violated the original concept for the park — that the only development necessary was that which would pay for its operations and maintenance. The affordable units, by their nature, would not produce such revenue. But New York City officials countered that the real estate development at the park could serve the twin imperatives of providing more low-cost housing and also supporting the park. Officials for the Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation praised the settlement. The lawsuit had delayed its consideration of development proposals for Pier 6; now that process can move forward. Belinda Cape, a spokeswoman for the park corporation, said: “We look forward to moving ahead with a fantastic project that will not only plug the final remaining gap in funding for this world class open space, but provide affordable housing, community space and a beautiful gateway to the park’s southern entrance.” The settlement also stipulates that the maximum heights of the two towers — 155 feet and 315 feet — include any mechanical structures on their roofs. Another residents’ group has sued the park corporation over the complex under construction to the north of Pier 6. That group argues that the mechanical structure there exceeds the building height caps.",

NATO helicopters and members of the Afghan National Security Forces were searching for the wreckage, according to a NATO statement . The cause of the crash was unclear. The plane was a civilian version of the C-130 transport aircraft used by the military for cargo, the NATO statement said. Gen. Zahir Azimi, the Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman, said the plane went down near Pul-i-Charkhi, east of Kabul. The city lies in the middle of a circle of mountains, and when planes reduce altitude as they are coming in for a landing they run the risk of crashing into the surrounding peaks. The mountainous area east of Kabul was where a Kam Air plane crashed in February 2005, leaving 104 people dead. The plane in Tuesday’s crash was operated by Transafrik, a cargo carrier flying on behalf of National Air Cargo in Orchard Park, N.Y., and it was delivering a load of general repair parts, National Air Cargo said in a statement. It said eight people were aboard, including one National Air Cargo employee, but the company did not disclose their names or nationalities. “The status of the personnel on board and cause of the crash are unknown at this time,” the company said in its statement. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the crew and their families.”",

    "source": "Yankees Update a Page in Steinbrenner’s Bullpen Guide <eos> That baseball visionary, George Steinbrenner, was way ahead of Brian Cashman. A generation ago, the Boss was already trending with a bold new plan in the back end of the Yankees’ bullpen. His team won the 1977 World Series, boasting a closer, Sparky Lyle, who won 13 games, saved 26, pitched to a 2.17 E.R.A. and gratefully accepted the American League’s Cy Young Award. What did George do? He signed a premier closer, Rich Gossage, known as Goose, and sent Lyle onto the winter banquet circuit in a foul mood. A young reporter at The New York Post was tipped that Lyle had sounded off at an event in New Jersey. He called Lyle at home, having never had the pleasure of a conversation with him. No matter. Lyle sounded off to a stranger. A scoop on a screaming tabloid back page beckoned. Gossage, next on the call list, agreed that the concept of two high-profile closers was crazy. Larry Rothschild, the Yankees’ current pitching coach, listened to this piquant slice of club history Saturday morning and smiled. “The closers went multiple innings back then,” he said. “Now it’s different. Now it takes three guys to do what sometimes one guy would do.” No offense. Just fact. Back in the day when bullpen aces were no quiche-eating, one-inning wonders, Lyle could throw 137 innings, his 1977 career high. In his 17 seasons as the Yankees’ closer, Mariano Rivera, by most accounts the best in baseball history, averaged fewer than 70. Well into the age of specialists for specific innings, we come to the imminent return of Aroldis Chapman to active baseball duty on Monday after a suspension by Major League Baseball for violating its domestic violence policy — and the much-anticipated reshuffling of Manager Joe Girardi’s late-inning bullpen machinations. Cashman — the last general manager hired (and never fired) by Steinbrenner — made a stunning acquisition with his deal for the southpaw Chapman, who routinely hits 100 miles per hour on the radar gun, amazing to no less a flamethrower than Dellin Betances. “The difference between me and him is that I’ll hit 100” once in a while, Betances said, “where he hits it consistently. He’s a physical specimen, something else.” Cashman wanted to enhance the faded Yankee championship brand by making opponents cower if they trailed after six innings. The last-place team in the American League East, the Yankees have been taking on water in most other places, their disabled list increasingly inhabited by the aged and chronically infirm. In the rearrangement of relievers that Girardi said would most likely take effect as soon as the appropriate game situation presented itself, it’s another story altogether. There, perfection gets demoted. That would be Andrew Miller and his 0.00 E.R.A., after Friday night’s rare flirtation with failure. A four-out, 36-pitch effort ended with Miller leaving the bases loaded in a 3-2 victory, recording his sixth save — after 36 last season, when he was honored as the American League’s best relief pitcher. Miller strolled into the clubhouse Saturday morning, ducked his lean, 6-foot-7 frame into his dressing stall, and spoke so dispassionately about his anticipated move to an eighth-inning setup role (with Betances taking over the seventh) that he sounded like a decaffeinated television analyst discussing it from the booth. “Might be a little bit of an emotional adjustment, trying to prepare quicker but not get too amped up,” he said. “I don’t think it’ll be too big an issue.” In a career of routine change — five teams in 11 seasons, starter to reliever to closer to setup — Miller, 30, has apparently found a healthy context, along with the four-year, $36 million contract Cashman provided him before last season. Betances, 28, also said he was all in with the program. Asked if he believed that he eventually would be the Yankees’ closer, he said: “I can’t get out of my lane. That’s where I’m at. Trying to be the best I can at that.” Joba Chamberlain once was heralded as Rivera’s heir. Who knows what the future brings? Who can even say how long Cashman will have the luxury of keeping Chapman, Miller and Betances? Cashman considered moving Miller after acquiring Chapman, who will be a free agent after this season. The three-man plan could be on a two-month tryout. If the Yankees settle into or around the A.L. East cellar, how could Cashman resist trading from strength? The late-inning relievers would be his best assets with which to inject more youth and hope into what, until this weekend, has played like an atrophying team. But on Saturday at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees chased Boston’s ace, David Price, and beat the Red Sox for a second straight day, 8-2. Cashman expressed his frustration recently with what he called underperforming talent, but he has been at this for two decades and has to know that this team is far from his finest. If it fails to get into the postseason picture by July, count on calls for Cashman to produce the kind of coup Sandy Alderson scored for the Mets when he landed Noah Syndergaard and Travis d’Arnaud for the aging knuckleballer R. A. Dickey. Yes, it’s early. Chapman, who will be at the Stadium on Sunday to meet with reporters, should be on many days a sight to behold. Miller and Betances are formidable. The Yankees won Saturday behind Nathan Eovaldi’s eight strong innings, coasting without the services of Betances, who had pitched in three straight games, and Miller, who shook his head when told that Friday night’s wild ninth inning had made for riveting television. “I wish it hadn’t been,” he said, preferring and usually delivering less stress in the workplace. Friday night’s game — an emotional win against their fiercest rival — may have pumped some much-needed adrenaline into the Yankees’ collective body. It also illustrated why Cashman made the Chapman deal. Ordinary or old in too many places, the Yankees really needed to be dominant somewhere. Nor must Girardi stick to the 7-8-9 script every time the Yankees have a lead after six innings. He has always been considered a shrewd handler of his bullpen. Let the juggling begin. “I think it always depends on what the situation calls for,” Girardi said. Sparky Lyle might agree. In 1978, even with Gossage as the closer-in-chief, Lyle saved nine games, won nine more, and received another World Series ring. The Boss was right.",

    "source": "Honor Comes Late to Óscar Romero, a Martyr for the Poor <eos> SAN SALVADOR — María de los Angeles Mena Alvarado knelt at the tomb of the slain archbishop and wept. She had come to the crypt of the city’s cathedral to pray for a cure for the diabetes that was threatening her eyesight and weakening her kidneys. “I feel that, yes, he can perform a miracle,” said Ms. Mena, 62. Thirty-five years after Óscar Romero, the Roman Catholic archbishop of San Salvador, was assassinated with a single bullet as he said Mass in a modest chapel here, this small country is celebrating his beatification on Saturday, the final step before sainthood. For many here and in the rest of Latin America, though, Archbishop Romero is already a saint. His tireless advocacy for the poor resonates deeply in a region where the gulf between those with riches and those without remains vast. He was the champion of impoverished Salvadorans, his homilies and radio broadcasts giving voice to their struggles. And as political violence battered the country and death squads killed any activist who challenged the existing order, the archbishop was defiant. “I have frequently been threatened with death,” he said two weeks before he was killed. “If they kill me, I shall rise again in the Salvadoran people.” The decision by Pope Francis to declare Archbishop Romero a martyr to the faith and speed up the long-stalled process toward his sanctification is widely seen as a recognition of the deep pastoral commitment the archbishop demonstrated, at the cost of his life. “He spoke the truth; he spoke through facts,” said Eva Menjívar, a former Carmelite nun who knew him in the 1970s and continues as a religious worker in poor communities. “We have never stopped teaching the spirit and values of Monsignor Romero.” For decades, the conservative Vatican hierarchy was suspicious of Archbishop Romero, as it was of many Latin American priests who were influenced by liberation theology, which challenges the social and economic structures that perpetuate poverty. Even today he remains a divisive figure in El Salvador, where some on the right believe he was a communist in clerical garb. Archbishop Romero never identified himself with liberation theology. But as an advocate for the poor, “he took sides; he was not a neutral bystander,” said Robert Ellsberg, a scholar and publisher of Orbis Books, a Catholic publishing house. “He spoke out clearly without compromise against the violence and injustice of the elite.” In that sense, he had much in common with Pope Francis, who has said he wants “a poor church for the poor.” The Rev. Gustavo Gutiérrez, the Peruvian priest whose 1971 book first outlined liberation theology, said Archbishop Romero was motivated by the poverty and suffering he saw in El Salvador rather than by any ideology. “Monsignor Romero now appears to be understood, as he was also very misunderstood,” he said. Before Archbishop Romero was appointed in 1977, he had not confronted the growing military repression directly. But a few weeks later, a Jesuit priest and friend, the Rev. Rutilio Grande, was assassinated. The archbishop celebrated Mass several weeks afterward and then organized a procession through the rural town where Father Grande had been organizing farmworkers, recalled the Rev. Jon Sobrino, a liberation theologian who became an adviser. The group suddenly encountered soldiers with their rifles drawn and stopped short. But from the back of the file the archbishop’s voice rang out, urging people, “Forward!” The soldiers lowered their rifles. In the context of the Cold War, Archbishop Romero’s stance marked him as subversive in the eyes of the United States-backed Salvadoran military, even though he also criticized violence by the guerrillas. The month before he was killed, Archbishop Romero wrote to President Jimmy Carter to ask him to end United States support for the military. Then, on March 23, 1980, he called on soldiers to disobey illegal orders. “The peasants you kill are your own brothers and sisters,” he said. The next day, a red Volkswagen pulled up outside the chapel at the cancer hospice where he lived, and a shot was fired from the car’s back window through the chapel doorway to the altar, and the archbishop fell bleeding. A United Nations truth commission found that his murder was planned by a group of officers led by Roberto d’Aubuisson, a former army major who led the death squads. Nobody was ever prosecuted for the assassination, and Mr. d’Aubuisson died of cancer in 1992 . Left open is whether he was acting for someone in the oligarchy. At the archbishop’s funeral, snipers fired on mourners, killing as many as 40 people amid scenes of panic. In the months after Archbishop Romero’s death, the violence escalated into a brutal civil war in which at least 75,000 people were killed before peace accords were signed in 1992. Under President Ronald Reagan, Washington sent as much as $1.5 million a day to support the Salvadoran military. The long-awaited recognition for Archbishop Romero comes to a country and a region that is very different in some ways. But the daily reality of the poor has changed little. Right-wing military dictatorships have been swept away in Latin America. Outright political violence is rare, and in all but a few countries there is a vibrant civil society that is free to criticize governments without fear. In El Salvador, the warring sides of the civil war now compete in elections, and President Salvador Sánchez Cerén is a former guerrilla commander. Democracy has proved a profound disappointment, though. Inequality is as entrenched as it was in Archbishop Romero’s time, and the poor of El Salvador — along with those in many other countries in Latin America — now live in the grip of criminal, not political, violence. “The violence now is of the poor against the poor,” said Roberto Cuéllar, a lawyer who worked with Archbishop Romero to offer legal services to the poor and document human rights abuses. “He would be bitter to see that after reaching the peace accords that we are still in the same place.” Msgr. Ricardo Urioste, who was the vicar general to Archbishop Romero, said the Salvadoran church had failed to take a role in addressing the gang violence that rages through the poor neighborhoods. “I think the church should take a more active part,” said Monsignor Urioste, taking a sharply critical view of a hierarchy that has long resisted honoring the archbishop. “I think if Monsignor Romero were here he would talk to the gangs, something no bishop is doing here. And he would be talking about injustice.” The question now is whether Archbishop Romero’s beatification will prove to be merely a symbol or a watershed for Latin America. Many Central Americans — almost 50 percent of Salvadorans are younger than 25 — have no direct memory of the wars that racked the region and the role that socially committed priests played. And a generation of young people who were inspired by liberation theology in the 1970s have moved on, preferring to work in human rights, labor organizing, legal aid or economic development. They have helped to enrich civil society, where the church now plays a much smaller role. Those who revere Archbishop Romero worry that the long-awaited official recognition may simply be an effort to soften his legacy. “It is an attempt to claim his message,” Lissette Hernández, 42, who works on rural development projects, said after a concert in the archbishop’s memory. “He was correct in the way he lived the Gospel.” “I have mixed feelings” about the beatification, she said. “Nobody has asked for forgiveness or solved the crime.”",

    "source": "Late Burst by James Helps Heat Even Series <eos> INDIANAPOLIS — Just when it looked as if the Indiana Pacers might have buried the memory of their mysterious bouts of performance dysfunction, they were reminded of an equally unpleasant reality of their Eastern Conference semifinal against Miami. LeBron James, the best player in the world, plays for the other guys. And his sidekick, Dwyane Wade, seems to be at his healthiest after missing 28 games during the regular season. After allowing others on both teams to make signature plays over three quarters, James erupted in the fourth for 12 of his 22 points, and Wade added 10 of his team-high 23 in carrying the Heat to a series-leveling 87-83 victory over the Pacers in Game 2 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Game 3 will be played Saturday in Miami. With the game in the balance, James and Wade combined to score 20 consecutive points, with James erupting for 9 straight and setting up two more with a steal during an 11-2 run that turned a 73-69 Pacers lead into an 80-75 deficit with 3 minutes 17 seconds to play. “That’s why they’re the $100 million guys,” said the Heat’s backup point guard, Norris Cole, who had 11 points and contributed harassing defense as the Heat held the Pacers to 40 percent shooting. After Indianapolis’s day got off to a deflating start with the denial of the city’s bid for the 2018 Super Bowl, James made it a total washout with 22 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists, shredding Indiana’s normally stout defense in almost every imaginable way in the second half. He penetrated the lane and kicked the ball out to open jump shooters. He slipped away from defenders and moved without the ball for uncontested layups. He hit spirit-crushing jumpers and made the biggest steal of the game, with a strip of George Hill that culminated with Wade putting back James’s missed layup for that 80-75 lead. “It was even the whole game, but then LeBron stepped up and made big plays,” said the Pacers’ Lance Stephenson, who was the best player on the floor for three quarters but scored just 2 of his 25 points in the fourth. James wanted to talk more about Miami’s collective defense, an underpublicized trademark during its run to consecutive championships and three straight N.B.A. finals. Referring to the Game 1 defeat, he said: “We had a lot of breakdowns, a little bit of everything. We understand that. We corrected our mistakes. That’s the great thing about this team. We own up to what we did, and then we come out and make it happen.” Image Dwyane Wade shooting over the Pacers’ Lance Stephenson. Wade led the Heat with 23 points. Credit Brian Spurlock/USA Today Sports, via Reuters No team can face a must-win situation in a playoff series before it has played a game at home, and James played down the fear of the possibility of a two-game deficit. It was just basic math, he said, after falling behind from the start. “You come out and play a better game than you did last time,” he said. “Leave it all on the floor.” The Pacers, conversely, were determined to hang onto the home-court advantage they secured during the final week of the regular season after they had surrendered what had been a season-long hold on the conference’s top seed. Miami helped with a 3-6 April record that included home-court losses to Minnesota and the Nets and road failures at Atlanta and Washington. The game was tough and tense, resembling the seven-game war of attrition the teams played in the conference final last season. The fourth quarter had two sequences that made everyone wince. In the first, Paul George stripped Wade, whose left knee collided with George’s head as he scrambled for the loose ball. George was cleared to continue, but after the game, he complained of blurry vision and said he would be re-examined before Game 3. Minutes after that collision, as James took over the game, he took a bounce pass from Wade and went in for a layup, only to be hammered out of bounds, face down, by David West. James was motionless for a few seconds but then picked his head up, slapped five with a fan and hit two free throws. “It’s a hotly contested series,” Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra said. “You just have to keep on it, stay with it.” The matchup problems caused by the Pacers in the frontcourt were apparent in Game 1, and Spoelstra conceded the point when he put Udonis Haslem in his starting lineup — just as his Pacers counterpart, Frank Vogel, had predicted. It looked good for the Pacers early as they controlled the boards and the tempo. One sequence illustrated Indiana at its grind-it-out best, beginning with George’s missed 16-foot jump shot. Roy Hibbert tapped the rebound out, and George launched another jumper, this time missing from 17 feet. Again Hibbert got a hand on the ball, leading to Stephenson nailing a 19-foot pull-up. When George scored on the break next time down, the Pacers had an 18-10 lead with about 5 minutes left in the quarter. But the danger of making bold statements about the Pacers has long been tied to their penchant for scoring droughts. They had one in the second quarter that allowed the Heat to build an 8-point lead, and they went cold at the worst possible time in the fourth quarter, with Stephenson unable to sustain his play and George, their best player, en route to 4-for-16 shooting. Sitting alongside James in the interview room, Wade spoke of all the Heat had learned their first season together when, he said, they panicked and lost late leads to the Dallas Mavericks in the finals. “Winning time,” he called those pressurized fourth-quarter moments, while James nodded in agreement.",

    "source": "G-20 Split on the Need for a Global Tax on Banks <eos> WASHINGTON — Proposals to establish a global tax on banks and charge them for the cost of government bailouts divided representatives of the Group of 20 countries during a summit meeting here on Friday. The perilous fiscal condition of Greece and other countries in Europe, and the need for the world’s big economies to coordinate changes in financial regulation , were the other major topics in the daylong meetings of Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors. “The global recovery has progressed better than previously anticipated, largely due to the G-20’s unprecedented and concerted policy effort,” the officials said in a joint communiqué. The International Monetary Fund endorsed a proposal this week that would establish a tax on bank profits and on salaries paid to bank executives. Canada, whose banking system withstood the crisis, has led the opposition to the idea, while the Obama administration, which has called for a $90 billion levy to be collected over 10 years from banks that received bailout money, tried to marshal support for it. “There was not agreement on a global bank tax,” Jim Flaherty, the Canadian finance minister, said at a news conference after the meetings. “Some countries are in favor of that. Some countries quite clearly are not. It depends whether a country has had to use taxpayers’ dollars to bail out banks, for the most part.” Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner defended the idea. “We’re trying to establish the basic principle that where governments are exposed to risk in putting out financial fires like this, that taxpayers don’t bear the costs of paying for those actions,” he said, adding, “That is a simple, fair, basic imperative.” Mr. Geithner said there was “significant support” for the bank tax, but allowed that he understood a “certain lack of enthusiasm” from Canada. He added, “We’re going to do what’s necessary for the U.S., what’s in our interest, and I think the world’s going to want to watch what we do. And I suspect that’ll provide a basis for other actions across some of the other economies.” The cautiously worded joint communiqué acknowledged, but sidestepped, the bank tax proposals. It called for further I.M.F. study “on options to ensure domestic financial institutions bear the burden of any extraordinary government interventions where they occur, address their excessive risk-taking and help promote a level playing field, taking into consideration individual countries’ circumstances.” John Lipsky, the deputy managing director of the I.M.F., said on Friday that the bank tax, if calculated based on the risk banks posed to the financial system, “could help to discourage financial institutions from taking on excessive risk.” Such a fee would also “address the public policy concern that financial institutions are able to privatize gains but socialize costs arising in the financial sector,” he said. Mr. Lipsky’s boss, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the top I.M.F. official, caused rumblings on Friday when he suggested that some countries were moving too quickly on reform. He said the Obama administration’s plan “comes too soon” given the need to coordinate responses across countries. “I read that and I thought, really?” Mr. Geithner said in response. “My sense is that it’s been 15 months — or more than a year — since we started this process in the United States. We’re not moving with excessive haste.” Mr. Geithner acknowledged that one of the biggest reform elements — forcing banks to hold more capital as a buffer against economic disruptions — was partly beyond the scope of the legislation being debated by Congress. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a global regulatory body, is coordinating discussions around capital requirements in the hope of announcing new standards by the end of this year. “The core issue there is the quality and quantity of capital and setting standards for that, and also an appropriate cap on leverage,” said Mr. Flaherty. “We agreed that that’s a key element.” The Group of 20 officials offered few details on the Greek debt crisis, except to support the aid plans of the European Union and the I.M.F. Mr. Flaherty said of the Greeks: “They have undermined the confidence of the markets and it is essential that some steps be taken, that the Greek government work with the I.M.F., and the European Commission of course, to identify a credible, multiyear economic and fiscal program.” Although India and Brazil this week joined calls by the United States for China to allow the value of its currency, the renminbi , to appreciate, the Group of 20 officials said the topic did not come up in their meetings. Yoon Jeung-Hyun, the South Korean finance minister who coordinated the meetings, said “there were no specific discussions” of either the renminbi, also known as the yuan, or the euro , which has recently fallen in value. Even as problems in Europe preoccupied the leaders, officials reported positive developments in some poorer parts of the world. The I.M.F. projected on Friday that economic output in sub-Saharan Africa would expand by 4.75 percent this year and 5.75 percent next year, up from 2 percent last year. “The economic slowdown in sub-Saharan Africa looks set to be mercifully brief,” said Antoinette Monsio Sayeh, director of the fund’s African department, adding that “the slowdown has nonetheless entailed considerable social dislocation and suffering.”",

    "source": "Bringing Potential Dropouts Back From the Brink <eos> Roosevelt ON the morning of her Regents Exam in English language arts earlier this month, Sheile Echie-Davis, an 11th grader at Roosevelt High School, pointed to a blemish just below the swirls of pink and purple polish that covered her long fingernails and explained its meaning. “I’ve been writing so much, I’m getting bruises from holding my pencils,” she said, her tone conveying pride rather than concern that the results of weeks of intense studying were so visible. Sheile, 16, expected to do well on the exam, judging by her past results: She scored 88 percent on her Regents Exam in United States history last year, even though the subject is her least favorite. Three years ago, Sheile was an unlikely candidate for academic success given her chronic truancy from school. Skipping class regularly led to her having to repeat eighth grade in her Brooklyn middle school. Parental pressure and visits from truancy officers did little to budge her belief that the classroom was not where she belonged. Dropping out, she said, was a foregone conclusion. “There was just no way for me to sit with 35 other kids and be able to learn anything,” she said. “I couldn’t do it.” Sheile’s prospects improved when her mother and nine siblings moved to Roosevelt. Here, in a school district that is one of the area’s poorest, she caught up and is now planning her next step come graduation next spring: enrollment in a local college with the hopes of working as a medical technician. Dropping out is no longer a consideration. Roosevelt has a 34.6 percent dropout rate, according to figures from the New York State Department of Education from the 2004-5 academic year (the latest year for which statistics are available). By comparison, nearby Hempstead has a 7.1 percent dropout rate and Malverne a 3.7 percent dropout rate. To improve their dropout numbers, officials in districts throughout Long Island said they were taking aggressive steps to keep students in the classroom. Next year, Malverne will start a mentoring program to help students most at risk of dropping out. “Once they slip away, it’s hard to reconstruct a successful path,” said James H. Hunderfund, the superintendent. Brentwood also has programs in place to stem dropouts, including one that identifies children as young as elementary age who are not attending school and may be at risk of dropping out in later years. Sheile’s prospects improved when she enrolled in the New Horizons Alternative Education Program at Roosevelt High School. The five-year-old program caters to about 85 students from the regular high school who have been identified as academically at risk, whether because of truancy, disciplinary issues or even incarceration, said Charlene Stroughn, the program director. Housed in the sprawling Roosevelt High School, New Horizons classes take place in late afternoon and early evening, long after the 700 or so students enrolled in the regular high school have gone home. The late hours allow students to hold down jobs during the day. The alternative school also emphasizes small classes in which individual attention can be paid to students, allowing them to remediate and accelerate their academic standing so they can earn a high school diploma within a time frame consistent with their peers’. That distinction — targeting would-be dropouts and encouraging them not only to return to the classroom, but also to catch up with other students — is important because of new accountability standards school districts must adhere to under state law. Two years ago, the State Department of Education initiated a new system of tracking graduation rates that is based on the number of students who began ninth grade together and graduated four years later, said Tom Dunn, an Education Department spokesman. The goal of the tracking system was to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the number of students completing high school, he said. The previous system did not consider factors like students who dropped out in the first two years of high school, Mr. Dunn said. He called the new system much more accurate even though under it, school districts typically show lower graduation rates than reported using the previous system. Identifying students at risk of failing as early as possible is a vital step in their recovery, said Patrick A. Silvestri, principal of the Program of Alternative Comprehensive Education, or PACE, the alternative high school in Brookville sponsored by the Nassau Board of Cooperative Educational Services. Situated on 40 acres, the Brookville school sits at the end of a secluded road, giving it a remote feel that one recent graduate, Troy Sinatra, 18, of East Meadow, said he initially found daunting. “What is this place?” he recalled thinking when he began classes there two years ago at the suggestion of a guidance counselor who advised him that he was in danger of flunking out. The seclusion worked in Troy’s favor, though, allowing him to apply himself without distractions. Last week, Troy and his 24 classmates graduated from the program, which grants a special certificate. A New York State regents diploma is issued by each student’s home district. Joining Troy was Crystal Sanatass, 18, also of East Meadow. Next fall she will begin attending Nassau Community College, which would have been unimaginable a few years ago when her dismal attendance record at her middle school in East Meadow led her to consider dropping out. “I was just uninspired; no one took the time to sit me down and make the effort,” Crystal said. That changed with her enrollment at PACE. In addition to small class sizes and individual instruction, it emphasizes physical outlets like wall climbing and outdoor yoga that can help with behavioral issues that are often factors in attendance and performance, administrators said. Crystal said that she particularly enjoyed the yoga, which allowed her to relax and concentrate on her studies. “You would lay back and see the sight of the sky and the trees,” she said. “That was beautiful.”",

    "source": "Missile Is Fired at Copter Over Baghdad, U.S. Says <eos> BAGHDAD — A surface-to-air missile was fired on Saturday at an American Apache helicopter flying over the Sadr City section of Baghdad, American military officials said on Monday. The attack, which had not been disclosed previously, represents the first time that a helicopter has come under missile attack in Sadr City since fighting erupted in the Shiite enclave in March. The missile missed the aircraft. But the attack was sufficiently worrisome that the American military changed the route of an aerial tour of Baghdad it had arranged for a group of reporters, television cameramen and photographers on Monday. Two helicopters were to fly over or near Sadr City, but an official said the route had been changed because of the missile threat. The United States military has made extensive use of Apache helicopters to try to stop militias from firing rockets at the Green Zone and to protect American and Iraqi troops in Sadr City from Shiite fighters armed with small arms, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and roadside bombs. The helicopters have taken a heavy toll on the militia fighters. In an effort to blunt the American advantage in airpower, the militias have waited until dust storms have grounded the Apaches to unleash heavy rocket attacks on the Green Zone. But the attack on Saturday suggests that the militias may intend to make a more determined challenge to the American dominance in the air. Moktada al-Sadr’s movement and the main Shiite coalition within Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki’s government formally signed an agreement on Monday to end fighting in Sadr City, saying they hoped it would end seven weeks of violence. It is unclear whether a cease-fire will take hold. Officials in Mr. Sadr’s movement said they would permit confiscation of heavy weapons and arrests of wanted men, but they warned against any attempt to detain all Mahdi Army fighters. According to an American military official, who declined to be identified because the military has not publicly announced the attack, the attempt to shoot down an Apache occurred about 7:20 p.m. Saturday. An American patrol had been struck by a roadside bomb in Sadr City, and two Apache helicopters flew to the scene to investigate and provide protection for the troops. The missile, described as an SA-7 shoulder-fired missile, was fired at one of the helicopters. It exploded in midair and neither aircraft was damaged. Soldiers from an American Army civil affairs unit in Sadr City saw the missile ascending and reported that it seemed to have been launched from north of Al Quds Street, where the American military is building a large concrete wall to prevent militia fighters from infiltrating south. The missile was also seen by Iraqi volunteers in the “Sons of Iraq” program who provide security in Adhamiya, a nearby neighborhood. They found the missile’s body, which was turned over to American troops. Despite the agreement to end the fighting, there was no sign of a cease-fire along Al Quds Street. Militia fighters fired at Iraqi forces near the wall that the Americans are building. The Iraqi soldiers shot back, and an Apache helicopter fired a missile at a militia position. American military officials released figures on Monday showing more than 700 attacks a month in Baghdad in March and again in April, primarily at American and Iraqi troops — nearly triple the level in February, before the Sadr City clashes began. There have already been more than 200 attacks in May. Col. Allen Batschelet, the chief of staff of the military division securing Baghdad, said overall attacks are still down 42 percent since a peak of 1,200 last June. Colonel Batschelet said that since American and Iraqi troops began the operation to curb the firing of rockets from Sadr City, more missiles are now being fired from areas outside that district. He also said the militias are also using more 122-millimeter weapons, whose 12-mile range is double that of 107-millimeter rockets, which account for most attacks against the Green Zone. Many of the rockets and mortar shells fired by the militias have fallen wide of their intended targets. Of the 285 people killed or wounded by mortars and rockets in Baghdad since March 23, Colonel Batschelet said, 144 were Iraqis, 89 were coalition troops, 20 were Iraqi security troops, 15 were American civilians and 17 were of other nationalities. Officials from hospitals in Sadr City said casualties declined over the weekend. At noon on Monday, however, ambulances were still delivering the wounded. In some sections of Sadr City, residents seemed relaxed, walking on the street and shopping. Lines of cars were waiting for gas. The lines vanished a couple of weeks ago, because people were afraid to remain in the street for long periods of time.",

    "source": "As the Season Winds Down, the Rangers Are in a Familiar Spot <eos> SAN JOSE, Calif. — The Rangers have been in playoff position since Oct. 30, their 10th game of the season, but on the eve of their 70th, they are in danger of letting it slip away. They lost their grip on seventh place, which the Buffalo Sabres grabbed with an overtime victory against the Bruins on Thursday in Boston. They remained in eighth place Friday after the Washington Capitals defeated the Carolina Hurricanes, 2-1. “We knew it was going to be a dogfight,” Coach John Tortorella said. “We’re happy about being in it. Now we’ll see what happens.” The Rangers have been forced to scramble for a playoff berth in all three years that Tortorella has been coach. In 2009, they barely held on to finish seventh, ahead of the Montreal Canadiens and the Florida Panthers. In 2010, they missed the playoffs, falling one shootout short of catching the Philadelphia Flyers and Montreal. This season, they are battling the Sabres and the Hurricanes, who have turned games in hand into points. “It’s been the same the last four years,” said Henrik Lundqvist, who will again shoulder the schedule-ending goaltending burden. He will be making his 14th consecutive start on Saturday against the San Jose Sharks. The game will not be an easy one for the Rangers. The Sharks are in third place in the West and 8-1-1 in their last 10 games. “It’s a tight race; every game counts,” Lundqvist said. “You have to see it as a challenge, when every game is so important. It feels like the playoffs already.” On Friday, the Rangers had an extensive video session and a vigorous practice, working on “a lot of D-zone stuff, board battles, positioning, communication,” said the rookie Michael Sauer, who has emerged as one of the team’s steadiest defensemen. They also worked on defensive zone coverage and puck-possession battles along the boards, areas in which they were notably deficient in Wednesday’s 5-2 loss at Anaheim. “We’ve been running around in our own end a little too much, and they just wanted to make sure we stay in our areas, take our guys and be strong on the puck,” Sauer said. The loss in Anaheim was the 12th in the Rangers’ last 18 games (6-10-2), a stretch that may prove to be a season-killer. Tortorella said he was “confident, 100 percent” that his players were aware of the errors they made in Anaheim and had worked to correct them. So was Brandon Dubinsky, the first-line wing whose goal against Anaheim was his first in 12 games. “We’re confident, especially after the last two days of teaching, that we know what makes us a good team,” he said. “We understand the pressures — we’ve got to win this game, we need the points. But words are just words. We’ve got to not only talk about it; we have to believe in it.” Tortorella did not want to compare this season’s home-stretch battle to that of last season or the season before. “This is a different team from last year,” he said. “Like I said from the get-go, this team is closer, right from the grind of camp, through to developing a team identity. I said it from Day One and I still do: I like this hockey club — we’ve bonded together. “But we’re in the same spot.” Tortorella added: “I’m glad we’re there — some teams aren’t. This should be a time when you really grab hold of it and be part of it. We’re not out of it — we’re right in the middle of it, which is right where we want to be.” On Saturday night, they will find out if they really will be where they want to be, or in ninth place, out of a playoff spot with a dozen games to go.",

    "source": "The Online Ad That Knows Where Your Friends Shop <eos> IF a marketer asked people to hand over a list of all their friends so it could show them ads, few would comply. On social-networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, though, friendships are obvious, and advertisers are beginning to examine those connections. Two companies in particular, 33Across and Media6Degrees, are analyzing such connections, and they are not interested in basic friend lists, but in interactions on the sites, taking note when a user visits a friend’s page, sends a video or exchanges an instant message. In turn, they can identify people who are friends with a company’s existing customers, and then advertise to them. “The implications for this are pretty amazing,” said K-Yun Steele, vice president of Zenith Interactive, part of the Zenith Media unit of the Publicis Groupe, which works with clients including JPMorgan Chase, Puma and General Mills. He has tested both 33Across and Media6Degrees. Instead of using research to identify which Web sites are popular with certain demographic targets, these companies let “the consumer do the heavy lifting for you purely because of the proximity of that customer to other customers,” Mr. Steele said. “There’s a certain traction that you get when you target consumers that you know talk to each other, that you don’t get when you advertise like you would in print.” The approach is based on research , mostly from earlier this decade, about social groups; one influential paper showed that people in contact with clients of a telecommunications firm were more likely to respond to the company’s offer. Advertisers, eager for any information that allows them to waste fewer ads and spend less money, are trying Media6Degrees and 33Across to see whether friendships are a better indicator of who might like their products than other indicators like age, gender, geography or interests. “Instead of understanding all these things about people, you could understand who was connected to who,” said Eric Wheeler, the chief executive of 33Across. “The reality is, those people are very similar not only in socioeconomic terms, but in terms of what they click and buy, so it’s very valuable.” It may be valuable for advertisers, but for publishers, it is not great news — tactics like this mean that advertisers can assemble promising audiences while bypassing expensive sites like, say, CNN.com or ESPN.com . And privacy advocates are complaining about online tracking, a subject Congress is examining. This is a new arena — 33Across and Media6Degrees are two of the more established companies, and each was started within the last two years. They are seeing more and more data, too: traffic to social-networking sites increased 83 percent from April 2008 to April 2009, according to the Nielsen Company . Both companies try to link a Web site visitor to his friends (anonymously, they say). Media6Degrees and 33Across begin at an advertiser’s Web site. When someone visits a certain page — something that indicates interest, like a shopping-cart page or a product information page — the companies place a cookie (a tiny bit of text, like an identification number) on her computer. When she visits another site that has been programmed to look for that cookie, the new site can identify her as someone who has already put something in her shopping cart at a certain beauty site. Meanwhile, Media6Degrees and 33Across use data from social-networking sites to map users’ interactions. To see the connections, 33Across receives data on the type of interaction, like an instant message or a shared video link. Media6Degrees focuses on which Web addresses within social sites people are visiting, which can also indicate the type of interaction, as Web addresses for, say, video tend to look different from a traditional Web page. Both sites score the interactions on a scale from strong to weak based on a variety of factors. “Those will allow us to score out, to get rid of the voyeurs, and find the people who are closest connected to that buyer for that advertiser,” said Joe Doran, the chief executive of Media6Degrees. The companies then extend those connections to build a big audience. If a certain customer most frequently communicates with 30 people, the companies look at who those 30 people interact with the most, and so on. By doing this for all the customers for a certain brand, they can build up a large network for ads. The final step for these companies is actually showing ads, which Media6Degrees and 33Across accomplish by using ad exchanges like Yahoo’s RightMedia or Google’s DoubleClick Advertising Exchange. Media6Degrees and 33Across can tell the exchanges that they want to buy ads that will appear only on browsers harboring certain cookies. Mr. Steele said advertising this way was much cheaper than advertising by buying directly on high-end sites; he used CondéNet, which now goes by Condé Nast Digital, as an example. “Say you do a banner ad buy on CondéNet — that’s going to cost you $10 to $20” for every thousand impressions, he said. (A CondéNet spokeswoman said that range was low over all, but reasonable for banner ads in high-volume areas.) “With this technology, since we’re buying on network inventory, we’re going to be getting these audiences on Yahoo and things like that, using the consumer connections these friends have to buy that inventory much cheaper.” Even including the fees from 33Across and Media6Degrees, buying through them was five to 10 times less expensive than buying through premium sites, Mr. Steele said. Despite the promise of the companies, they have a few challenges. One is the threat of Congressional regulation. Congress has recently been holding hearings on online advertising, quizzing executives from sites like Facebook and Yahoo about the privacy and data practices at their firms. (People can opt out of the advertising at the companies’ sites.) And although the companies promise to reduce waste in advertising, they do not promise to eliminate it. People communicate with their friends online, but they may also be communicating with their parents or random acquaintances — people from different age or socioeconomic groups. Margaret Clerkin, the head of the invention group at Mindshare, a division of WPP’s GroupM, who works with clients including Unilever and Sprint, said she wondered whether the approach would work for every category. “The theory feels strong that in this very social environment that people are influenced more by their friends than they are by advertisers and brands,” she said. She plans to test Media6Degrees and 33Across later this year. “I think the validity of that is going to end up being tested by brand and by category,” she said. “I can’t believe you’re going to see the same ratio in buying a bar of soap that you are in buying a car. The influence rate is going to be so much greater as the price tag of the product goes up.”",

    "source": "Letters to the Editor <eos> Behind Bars, All Alone TO THE EDITOR: Re “ Punished for Life ” (Aug. 4): In the wake of President Obama’s pointed comments on the overuse and dangerous effects of solitary confinement, elected officials and prison and jail officials in every level of government must take action. At Brooklyn Defender Services, we see firsthand the devastation wrought by solitary confinement on our clients. They often fall into a devastating cycle of rules infractions, solitary confinement, decompensation and more rules infractions. Legislation introduced in New York State would end the torture of solitary confinement and create more humane and effective alternatives. The Humane Alternatives to Long-Term (HALT) Solitary Confinement Act would limit time in “the Box” to 15 days to comply with the United Nations standard, prevent the use of isolation to silence whistle-blowers, and expand programming and support for incarcerated people — reducing recidivism and making us all safer. More than 5,000 of our fellow New Yorkers are in solitary right now, and we owe it to them to call our state legislators and urge support for the HALT Solitary Confinement Act today. Lisa Schreibersdorf Brooklyn The writer is executive director, Brooklyn Defender Services. TO THE EDITOR: It is well established that human beings require social interaction and sensory stimulation in order to be well adjusted. Yet the solitary confinement policies routinely employed in this country deprive prisoners — many of whom suffer from serious mental, emotional and personality disorders to begin with, but who nonetheless will eventually be released into the community at large at the end of their sentences — of these essential building blocks of psychological health. These practices therefore not only amount to cruel and unusual punishment, but are also shortsighted, counterproductive and self-defeating. John S. Koppel Bethesda, Md. TO THE EDITOR: I can only imagine that long-term solitary confinement is as awful and damaging as the article suggests. Still, in reading that inmates “were grieving for their lost lives, for their loss of connectedness to the social world and their families outside and also for their lost selves,” I would have felt more sympathy for them if they also had grieved for the victims of the crimes, who were at least as equally emotionally traumatized as they were, if not physically brutalized or even outright murdered. Edward S. Hochman New York City TO THE EDITOR: I couldn’t help connecting a few dots when I read this article alongside the one about the Chinese chatbot that responds to the intimate messages of its many users. I thought perhaps someone could develop a chatbot for prisoners. Spending 25 years in solitary is inhuman. Offering our prison population some intelligent “human” contact might be a nice touch. Peter Zamiska New York City Aliens Among Us? TO THE EDITOR: Re “ A Case for Why We’re Alone ” (Out There, Aug. 4): The way I heard it at the time was that in a discussion among physicists of the possibility of extraterrestrial civilizations, in which almost everybody agreed that there surely were such, Enrico Fermi simply said, “So where are they?” He meant that if there were such, some of them should certainly be advanced enough to have come here to visit. But we haven’t seen any such aliens. The story then continues that the well-known Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard replied, “They are all around us, called Hungarians!” Roger G.

    "source": "Michigan’s Athletic Director Quits Amid Growing Rancor <eos> Dave Brandon was considered the new model for an athletic director at a major university when he took over at Michigan in 2010. Having been the chief executive of Domino’s Pizza, a multibillion-dollar company, he was seen as someone better qualified to steer a major sports program than the usual candidates like former athletes and university officials. Yet Brandon resigned Friday, under increasing scrutiny from the board of regents, on which he used to sit, revealing that a modern college sports department might be a more complicated business than a multinational company. “Dave feels that it would be in the best interests of our student-athletes, the athletic department and the university community if he moved on to other challenges and allowed the important work of the department and the university to continue without daily distractions,” the university president, Mark Schlissel, said Friday afternoon at a news conference. Another former chief executive, James Hackett, previously the head of an office furniture company in Grand Rapids, Mich., and a former teammate of Brandon’s at Michigan under Coach Bo Schembechler, will replace Brandon on an interim basis, Schlissel said. Brandon, 62, will receive a total of $3 million and other benefits over the next four years — including two Regents Emeritus seats to football, men’s basketball and hockey games. Under Brandon’s tenure, Michigan’s proud football program — which has the most wins in college football history — has increasingly displayed an on-field decline. The Wolverines, 7-6 last season, are 3-5 (1-3 Big Ten) heading into Saturday’s game against Indiana. Brandon had become a lightning rod at Michigan, not just because of the football team’s ineptitude or the handling of a concussed quarterback in a game in September, but also for his unconventional marketing tactics. Football games have featured aircraft flyovers, sky divers who deliver the game ball and even a video greeting from Beyoncé that played during halftime of the 2013 Notre Dame game. Recently, he proposed using fireworks. The last straw appeared to come in emails published this week on a popular Michigan blog that were said to have been sent by Brandon in which he responds to fan complaints, telling one to root for a different team. In an interview at the Big Ten’s football media days in 2013, Brandon spoke of the financial pressure he was under. “Domino’s Pizza is a $7.5 billion company doing business in 72 countries, and the most capital I ever spent in one year was $40 million,” he said, noting that in his first four years at Michigan, the athletic department spent more than $200 million on renovations for the football stadium, $100 million on the basketball arena and millions more on hockey and softball facilities. His background at Domino’s was supposed to have prepared him for managing and growing the athletic department, but critics in recent months have decried higher ticket prices at football games and his business executive approach. Image Dave Brandon resigned as athletic director after nearly five years in the role. Credit Leon Halip/Getty Images “I have to raise revenue, deploy capital, manage costs, market to a broad group of stakeholders,” Brandon said in the 2013 interview. “I have to stand alone and be accountable to a lot of people who care about what I do.” Discontent with the football team alchemized into national news this season, with blame shifting from Coach Brady Hoke to Brandon in the aftermath of Michigan’s 30-14 loss to visiting Minnesota on Sept. 27. In that game, quarterback Shane Morris appeared to take a blow to the head and become dazed but was kept in for another play and reinserted later for another. Afterward, more than 11,000 members of the university community signed a petition to fire Brandon. The petition called the football program “a black eye” and accused the athletic department of threatening to produce “a generation of alumni that are disinterested and disengaged.” It also further inflamed relations between Brandon, a Republican, and the board of regents, currently consisting of six Democrats and two Republicans. “We recognize Dave’s unwavering commitment to our student-athletes and coaches,” the board said in a statement Friday, but it added, “We appreciate and support President Schlissel’s leadership.” On Michigan’s campus, some students welcomed the news of Brandon’s departure, which came a few weeks after hundreds of students rallied for his ouster in the central area of campus known as the Diag. Edward Mears, a law student who wore an Ohio State sweatshirt to the protest, is among a group that includes undergraduates, graduate students and alumni who have been agitating for the firing. In the Diag on Friday, Mears and other group members handed out more than 1,000 “Fire Dave Brandon” T-shirts, which he said were now “collectors’ items.” “I think this was the right decision for the university and athletics department, as long as they do their due diligence in selecting an athletic director who can find the right balance between bringing in revenue and making it the experience that’s been passed through generations,” Mears said. Schlissel has been Michigan’s president only a few months; his predecessor, Mary Sue Coleman, hired Brandon in early 2010. At the news conference, Schlissel was pressed on whether Michigan ties were a requirement for the next athletic director. Emphasizing that the hire must appreciate “the cultural aspects of this athletic program and what it does for our community,” he denied that a Michigan connection was a must. Schlissel, a Princeton and Johns Hopkins graduate who was provost at Brown, added: “I feel like a Michigan man already. So you can learn the values of this great university.”",

    "source": "Data Show Bin Laden Plots; C.I.A. Hid Near Raided House <eos> WASHINGTON — After reviewing computer files and documents seized at the compound where Osama bin Laden was killed, American intelligence analysts have concluded that the chief of Al Qaeda played a direct role for years in plotting terror attacks from his hide-out in Abbottabad, Pakistan , United States officials said Thursday. The C.I.A. had Bin Laden’s compound under surveillance for months before American commandos killed him in an assault on Monday, watching and photographing residents and visitors from a rented house nearby, according to several officials briefed on the operation. The documents taken at the Abbottabad compound, according to American officials, show that Bin Laden was in touch regularly with the terror network he created. With his whereabouts and activities a mystery in recent years, many intelligence analysts and terrorism experts had concluded that he had been relegated to an inspirational figure with little role in current and future Qaeda operations. A rushed examination of the trove of materials from the compound in Pakistan prompted Obama administration officials on Thursday to issue a warning that Al Qaeda last year had considered attacks on American railroads. The documents include a handwritten notebook from February 2010 that discusses tampering with tracks to derail a train on a bridge, possibly on Christmas, New Year’s Day, the day of the State of the Union address or the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, officials said. But they said there was no evidence of a specific plot. An Obama administration official said that documents about attacking railroads were among the first to be translated from Arabic and analyzed. The materials, along with others reviewed in the intelligence cache, have given intelligence officials a much richer picture of the Qaeda founder’s leadership of the network as he tried to elude a global dragnet. “He wasn’t just a figurehead,” said one American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, who had been briefed on the documents. “He continued to plot and plan, to come up with ideas about targets and to communicate those ideas to other senior Qaeda leaders.” The C.I.A. surveillance team in the rented house near Bin Laden’s hide-out took pains to avoid detection not only by the suspected Qaeda operatives they were watching but by Pakistani intelligence and the local police. Observing from behind mirrored glass, C.I.A. officers used cameras with telephoto lenses and infrared imaging equipment to study the compound, and they used sensitive eavesdropping equipment to try to pick up voices from inside the house and to intercept cellphone calls. A satellite used radar to search for possible escape tunnels. Still, the spying operation had its limits: the American surveillance team would see a man take regular walks through the compound’s courtyard — they called him “the pacer” — but they were never able to confirm the man was Bin Laden.  The aggressive effort across the intelligence community to translate and analyze the documents seized from the hide-out has as its top priority discovering any clues about terrorist attacks that might be in the works. Intelligence analysts also were scrubbing the files for any information that might lead to identifying the location of Al Qaeda’s surviving leadership. Since Sunday night, counterterrorism officials have been alert to the possibility of new attacks from Al Qaeda to avenge its leader’s death. Department of Homeland Security officials have reviewed potential terrorist targets and deployed extra security at airports. And in response to the new evidence seized at the Bin Laden compound, the Transportation Security Administration issued a bulletin to rail companies. But officials emphasized that the information was both dated and vague, calling it \"aspirational\" and saying there was no evidence the discussion of rail attacks had moved beyond the conceptual stage. As the Bin Laden trail grew cold and he stopped broadcasting videos to the world in the last several years, his status as the world’s most influential terrorist seemed to diminish. Still, in the decade since he fled Afghanistan in late 2001, he managed to release four to six audio messages each year, often making reference to current events, showing that his hide-out was not entirely cut off from the outside world. “If he could get six audio messages out in a year, he could certainly get instructions to his followers,” said Ben N. Venzke, who runs IntelCenter, a Virginia company that tracks terrorist groups’ Internet communications. That Bin Laden was found not in Pakistan’s rugged tribal areas but in an affluent town less than an hour from the capital, Islamabad, has prompted a rethinking of the widespread notion that he had little control over Al Qaeda. “Until now, the prevailing wisdom was that he was hiding in a remote, isolated mountain range and cut off from his followers,” said Bruce Hoffman, an expert on Al Qaeda at Georgetown University . “Now we know that was all wrong and reconsider what his role really was.” American officials and terrorism experts have warned that this is not the end of Al Qaeda. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday that the United States would continue aggressive operations against militants.",

When the menu appears, tap the Delete option. For those times when you just want to reword a previously made comment, press the text on screen for a second or two until the menu arrives and select Edit. Once you have fixed your typo or clarified your remarks, tap the Update button. The process for deleting and editing comments is similar on Facebook’s iPhone app . Seeking Control of the iOS Control Center Q. Is it possible to change the icons on the Control Center screen in iOS 8? Some of the shortcuts, like Airplane Mode, are handy, but I never use the Do Not Disturb or Timer functions and would rather put more useful settings there. A. Apple introduced Control Center in 2013 with the release of iOS 7 , but the slide-up menu of shortcut icons to popular functions has been decidedly static since its arrival. Developers have previously found settings buried in the code within beta versions of iOS, which let the Control Center screen be configured differently. The authorized final editions of the system Apple has released to the public, however, include only settings for allowing access to the feature from the iPhone’s lock screen, or within apps. But while Apple does not include tools in the Control Center settings that let users customize the selection of shortcuts, developers who create software for jail-broken iPhones have come up with ways to change the icons. Jail-breaking, which is the intentional modification of the phone’s official system software to install alternative apps and gain more access to the device, is not illegal, but it can take some technical patience and fortitude to do properly. If that appeals to you, a quick web search on the topic brings plenty of advice on how to start. As one might expect, jail-breaking is strongly frowned upon by Apple, which notes that “unauthorized modifications” can cause numerous issues with iOS devices. A webpage on the company’s site also states “unauthorized modification of iOS is a violation of the iOS end-user software license agreement and because of this, Apple may deny service for an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch that has installed any unauthorized software.” If that makes you nervous and dissuades you from tinkering with your phone, you can at least add your voice to the chorus of other users on Apple’s feedback page requesting iPhone features.",

    "source": "Guilds Are Said to Have Concerns on Miramax Talks <eos> LOS ANGELES — Representatives of Hollywood’s principal guilds have told the Walt Disney Company that they have serious concerns about the possible sale of its Miramax Films unit to an investor group organized by David Bergstein. A number of Mr. Bergstein’s companies are subjects of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings in which the guilds are creditors. The guild leaders are alarmed that Disney is in exclusive talks with Mr. Bergstein, his co-investor Ron Tutor and others, according to a person briefed on the expressions of concern, which have stopped short of a formal threat to oppose the acquisition. A sale would turn over responsibility for millions of dollars in residual payments connected with more than 600 films and television episodes in the Miramax library. That person spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid conflicts with Disney, guild leaders and the Bergstein group. A Disney spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said top Disney executives said they were unaware of the guilds’ expression of concerns. For the last week, Disney has been talking exclusively with the group led by Mr. Bergstein. Those talks began after a group that included the investor Ron Burkle and Bob and Harvey Weinstein, the brothers who co-founded Miramax and later sold it to Disney, failed to reach a deal for the unit. A failure by Mr. Bergstein’s group could swing the Weinsteins and Mr. Burkle back into center position. The Screen Actors Guild, the Directors Guild of America and the Writers Guild of America, West — as well as their related pension and health plans — have been listed as creditors in a complex of bankruptcy cases that involves the Capco Group and other companies associated with Mr. Bergstein. One case, which was filed in March in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, includes claims related to the films “Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead” and the “Love Ranch,” an as-yet-unreleased film directed by Taylor Hackford, who is the president of the directors guild. Representatives for the three guilds declined to comment. Asked on Thursday about the guild concerns, Mr. Bergstein said the specific claims against various companies in the bankruptcy court were misdirected, because he did not actually produce movies and was not a party to agreements the guilds cited. “My organization basically is a lender,” Mr. Bergstein said, adding that he had specialized in buying the debt of distressed companies and acquiring assets through foreclosure. Mr. Bergstein described any attempt by the guilds to question the possible Miramax sale as belonging to a pattern of illegal interference with his business. “To call a potential seller is completely illegal behavior,” Mr. Bergstein said. “We’ll be doing something about it. I can’t tell you what,” he said, referring to what he described as continuing challenges to his business dealings by the guilds. Any legal challenge to a transfer of Disney’s guild obligations to a Bergstein-led group would most likely come only after a deal was concluded, partly because the guilds have been careful to avoid impairing their already tense relationship with Mr. Bergstein by taking a public position against the merger.",

    "source": "Earnhardt Gets a Victory After Two Top Rivals Get a Warning <eos> DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Dale Earnhardt Jr. aced his first test with his new team. Earnhardt had a smashing debut in his Hendrick Motorsports racecar, getting a boost from his new teammates to power past Tony Stewart to win the Budweiser Shootout on Saturday. It was Earnhardt’s first victory in any series since 2006, and it could be a sign of things to come now that he is partnered with Hendrick, Nascar’s most powerful team. Seconds after taking the checkered flag, Earnhardt declared himself a favorite for next week’s season-opening Daytona 500. “What a race car!” Earnhardt yelled over his radio. “This might be a 500 winner here.” The winner of the 70-lap exhibition has gone on to win the Daytona 500 five times, with Dale Jarrett the last in 2000. Earnhardt spun his new white No. 88 Chevrolet in a flurry of victory doughnuts before excitedly heading to Victory Lane. No one had to show him the way. It was his 11th victory at Daytona, Nascar’s most famous track, but first since a second-tier series win in June 2006. His last official Cup win came at Richmond the month before. “It felt pretty good to be back like we’re supposed to be,” said Tony Eury Jr., Earnhardt’s cousin and crew chief. The two burst into the winner’s news conference, Earnhardt sprinting to the stage with a huge grin. He said his 2004 Daytona 500 victory was his greatest, but that Saturday night’s show ranked right up there. “I don’t know what took him so long to win a race for us,” the car owner Rick Hendrick quipped. Stewart, a two-time series champion, capped a tumultuous 24 hours by finishing second. Stewart and Kurt Busch were told to steer clear of each other in a Saturday morning meeting because of an altercation on the track that carried over into the Nascar hauler. Stewart was said to have punched Busch during the confrontation, but all participants in that meeting would not confirm or deny the altercation. The attention surrounding Stewart dimmed the focus that has been on Earnhardt since he signed with Hendrick last June. “Tony and Kurt getting into it the other day, that sort of took us off the front page,” Earnhardt said. “I felt such a relief after that. I wasn’t happy for those guys being in that situation, but I felt like a load had lifted off my shoulders when I saw them walking to the Nascar hauler.” He equaled the distraction to the push he got from his new teammate Jimmie Johnson that won him the race. Stewart was closing in on the win until a late caution — caused when Busch spun — set up a final restart with three laps to go. Stewart was in front but was surrounded by Hendrick cars. The push from Johnson helped Earnhardt slide past Stewart on the outside and into the lead.",

    "source": "In Atlanta, a Quest to Keep Its Airport the World’s Busiest <eos> ATLANTA — The typical flier might wonder why an airport would promote its designation as the world’s busiest. Images of long lines, crowded concourses and auxiliary parking lots in the next area code could be evoked. But it is no small matter at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where officials say that the vibrancy of the local economy rests in part on how many passengers course through its sprawling terminals every day. And it is why some of those authorities took notice recently that Chicago’s O’Hare International surpassed Hartsfield-Jackson in one measurement of an airport’s activity: takeoffs and landings. Soon after, Atlanta’s mayor, Kasim Reed, announced that he was gathering a dozen marketing experts from prominent local firms and civic organizations to figure out how to keep its airport — and the area’s fiscal fitness — thriving. “We want to make sure we’re not sitting on our laurels,” Mayor Reed said. “Candidly, we were failing to aggressively promote the city to passengers passing through.” Indeed, growth in the airport’s traffic, after decades of steadily climbing, has leveled off in the last decade and is barely increasing. While the idea of a committee was conceived well before the latest passenger and operations statistics were disclosed, Mayor Reed said that one goal was to maximize flier volume. The thinking is, as more knowledge about the city is shared to the airport’s clientele, more jobs in the surrounding area ultimately could be created. Richard K. Green, a business and public policy professor at the University of Southern California, sees a correlation between busy airports and faster gains in jobs and population. “While it is very difficult to separate cause from effect, in my view there is stronger evidence than not that a busy airport leads to growth,” he said. The belief is that spreading awareness entices businesses, especially those based overseas, to relocate or expand in Atlanta, which happens to own and run the airport. To Jeffrey A. Rosensweig, associate professor of international business and finance at Emory University in Atlanta, a booming airport’s role in robust areas that it serves cannot be underestimated. “An airport can wield tremendous impact on the economic health of its city and its whole region. I believe that the global economy is pivoting around major hubs for trade and finance. World-class transportation facilities are a key to becoming a hub,” he said, citing Dallas and Denver as examples in the United States. The two cities “invested massive dollars in huge new airports and they have helped jobs and real estate boom in their regions,” he added. Image Crowds at the ticket counters in the Atlanta airport’s domestic north terminal. The airport’s growth has leveled off. Credit Kevin Liles for The New York Times No city-airport tandem has prospered in lock step like Atlanta and Hartsfield-Jackson. “The airport has been almost uniquely crucial to the rapid and sustained development of metro Atlanta and, frankly, of Georgia,” Mr. Rosensweig said. He suggested that Hartsfield-Jackson deserved credit in luring a wide range of entities, including automobile factories and prominent corporate headquarters like United Parcel Service and Porsche, and the 1996 Summer Olympics. Civic leaders have long envisioned the airport as a major component in helping to advance the area’s growth. In 1961, well before Atlanta was a primary population center, the largest single terminal in the country was christened. It was followed 19 years later by what was then the world’s biggest passenger terminal complex. One reason to focus on raising passenger numbers is that some airlines already with a presence will increase routes and those without a foothold will enter the market. Hartsfield-Jackson craves more direct international flights that are particularly appealing to foreign business leaders who might establish a presence in the region. “You have to look at an airport not only as a passenger depot, but as driving additional jobs and economic development,” said Miguel Southwell, the airport’s general manager of aviation. The airport is promoting itself as the busiest for the 17th straight year, citing Airports Council International statistics showing that slightly more than 96 million fliers boarded or exited planes (or both) there in 2014. The runner-up in the United States was O’Hare, with just under 70 million. The Chicago airport leapfrogged Hartsfield-Atlanta for operations — or, in aviation parlance, movements. O’Hare, which had ceded the distinction to its southern rival in 2005 and trailed ever since, recorded nearly 882,000, compared with some 868,000 in Atlanta. While some news reports, mainly in Chicago, declared O’Hare as the world’s busiest, the airport refrained from wagging a foam No. 1 finger and declined to comment about vaulting ahead in operations. For its part, Hartsfield-Jackson pointed out in a news release that passenger count is the metric for world’s busiest that is most recognized by the industry. Mr. Southwell took a subtle dig at O’Hare, saying in an interview, that Atlanta was not concerned that Chicago moves millions fewer passengers than Hartsfield-Jackson does “while using more aircraft.” Mr. Reed is equally unrestrained with making the “world’s busiest” boast. Like Mr. Southwell, he maintains that it carries discernible benefits. “I definitely think so,” said the mayor, noting how chief executives of major companies that have dropped anchor in the area have mentioned the ranking. About 1,500 German firms alone have metropolitan Atlanta mailing addresses. But some aviation officials are skeptical that the world’s busiest crown bears direct fruit on its own. “It’s a fascinating story,” said Rafael Echevarne, director of economics at Airports Council International World, a global trade representative. “Nonetheless, there are no tangible benefits to being the world’s busiest airport — whether from a passenger traffic or aircraft movement perspective — other than the recognition received.” And no matter the efforts of Atlanta officials, the title may not last long. Dubai, currently the world’s busiest international hub, is growing fast and, more immediately, the surging Beijing Capital International is about 10 million passengers a year behind, with the gap steadily narrowing.",

    "source": "Minority-Stake Sale Could Stabilize Mets’ Finances Through Next Year <eos> When the Mets said Thursday that they were in exclusive negotiations to sell the hedge fund mogul David Einhorn a minority stake in the team for $200 million, they moved one step closer to securing a much-needed financial lifeline. The question is how much breathing room Einhorn’s proposed cash infusion will give them. Fred Wilpon , the team’s principal owner, said this week that the Mets may lose as much as $70 million this season. With the injury-riddled team performing poorly, attendance has declined 10 percent this year, and fewer fans at Citi Field means less revenue from food concessions, parking and sales of team shirts and caps. And attendance could continue to decline next season if the Mets again finish under .500 — they are currently 23-27 — and then fail to make any notable signings during the winter. Still, the $200 million from Einhorn is almost certain to meet the team’s most pressing needs and potentially stabilize its finances at least through next year, several bankers and baseball executives said. The Mets are expected to use $75 million of Einhorn’s money to retire some of their bank loans and another $25 million to repay a loan, due next month, that the team received from Major League Baseball, according to several people familiar with the team’s finances. This should save the Mets tens, and perhaps hundreds, of thousands of dollars in interest payments. The remaining $100 million should help with the team’s most urgent issue — paying its players. With a payroll of about $142 million this season, roughly $12 million in checks must be cut every two weeks. At the very least, Einhorn’s investment would mean that the Mets will have little trouble on that front for the remainder of this season. But whether Einhorn’s cash would provide the impetus to sign a prominent free agent this November or December is another matter. Last winter, the Mets ignored that option and instead added a dozen players from baseball’s bargain basement for less than $11 million over all. The results, so far, have been decidedly mixed. Of course, Einhorn’s money would stretch further if the Mets’ payroll drops substantially, and it almost certainly will. Carlos Beltran ($18.5 million) is in the last year of his contract and will not be back and may soon be traded. Jose Reyes ($11 million) is also in the last year of his contract and he, too, is not likely to be a Met in 2012. The same can be said for closer Francisco Rodriguez ($11.5 million). And the $18 million now being paid to the already departed Luis Castillo and Oliver Perez will also be coming off the books. Vince Gennaro, a marketing consultant to several major league teams, said Einhorn’s $200 million buys the Mets “a significant amount of time, possibly well into next year.” And shedding numerous contracts, he said, “gives them a chance to realistically find pieces in the free-agent market.” But if the Mets do not, and there is no positive buzz about them through the winter, they may be faced with cutting ticket prices for a third straight season and reducing advertising and sponsorship rates. In addition, the contracts for some of the Mets’ high-priced suites at Citi Field will expire at the end of the season. Some clients may not want to renew unless the team promises to be more appealing than it has been the last few years. Although Einhorn was introduced Thursday, the Mets will not be receiving any of his cash immediately. If the agreement is completed — the team and Einhorn are in an exclusive negotiating period that could last 30 days or more — it must then be approved by Commissioner Bud Selig. If Einhorn is approved, there is no certainty he will disclose how much of a minority share he is taking on or if he has agreed, beyond his $200 million, to help cover the team’s losses on an ongoing basis. However, as soon as Einhorn signs his $200 million check to the team, the Mets will become more creditworthy, which means they could borrow more money if they want, a sports banker said. The team has more than $400 million in bank debt. “I get the sense that Morgan would lend again; they want to be helpful, for a bunch of reasons,” the banker said in reference to JPMorgan Chase. One other factor still looms — the $1 billion lawsuit filed against the team’s owners by the trustee representing victims of Bernard L. Madoff’s fraud. Until that is resolved, everything about the Mets ultimately has an air of uncertainty, even with Einhorn aboard. “Mets fans need to get hit with a cold dose of reality,” said Marc Ganis, an industry consultant. “In the near term, this team is not going to be able to operate like a big-market team.”",

    "source": "Sri Lanka Rejects Tamil Call for Cease-Fire <eos> COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Demanding a full surrender, the Sri Lankan government on Sunday dismissed a “unilateral cease-fire” declared by Tamil Tiger rebels who were surrounded and outnumbered by government troops on a narrow strip of land on the Indian Ocean. The rebels said the cease-fire was in response to calls from the United Nations and many foreign governments for a pause in the fighting, but military analysts said it appeared to be a reflection of the rebels’ severely weakened position. The Tigers did not say what they would do with the tens of thousands of civilians they had trapped in their shrinking strip of territory along the coast of northeastern Sri Lanka. “We are in full agreement that the humanitarian crisis can only be overcome by declaration of an immediate cease-fire,” the group said in a statement. “As the first step, we have now announced this unilateral cease-fire and call upon the international community to pressure the Sri Lankan government to reciprocate it.” The Sri Lankan defense secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, called the cease-fire offer a “joke.” “They were not fighting with us; they were running from us,” Mr. Rajapaksa said, according to Reuters. “There is no need of a cease-fire. They must surrender. That is it.” John Holmes, the United Nations under secretary general for humanitarian affairs, arrived in Colombo over the weekend to try to persuade the government to allow a humanitarian mission into the combat zone , where civilians were running short of food and medical supplies. Britain announced Sunday that its foreign secretary, David Miliband, would travel to Sri Lanka on Wednesday along with the foreign ministers of France , Bernard Kouchner , and Sweden , Carl Bildt , to discuss the plight of the trapped civilians. Sri Lanka’s foreign secretary, Palitha T. B. Kohona, told an Indian television station, NDTV, that the cease-fire offer was a “cynical effort” to gain leverage during Mr. Holmes’s visit. “The L.T.T.E. is down on its knees,” he said, using the initials of the formal name of the group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. “It has nothing to bargain with.” The military said Sunday that it had sunk three rebel boats offshore from the rebel-held territory, killing 13 fighters. Separately, more than 20 fighters surrendered on Sunday, according to a military spokesman. Roughly 500 fighters are left inside the four square miles of rebel-held territory, according to military estimates. The military’s assertions were impossible to verify; journalists have not been permitted near the war zone. The country’s governing coalition has been emboldened by a surge in popularity over its handling of the war. On Sunday it won a sweeping victory in a local election in Western Province. But government successes on the battlefield have also embittered many ethnic Tamils, especially those overseas, and have displaced at least 200,000 civilians now in refugee camps across the northern part of the country. The government is requesting tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments to help manage the flood of refugees. Since late January, when rebel-held territory shrank sharply, more than 6,400 civilians have been killed and 13,000 wounded, according to the United Nations.",

    "source": "Averyhardt and Howard Hope to Inspire Other Black Women <eos> DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — It was crunch time last Sunday in the last round of the L.P.G.A. ’s final qualifying tournament, and history and milestones were not the top priority for two young golfers trying to earn playing status for the 2013 tour. Shasta Averyhardt and Ginger Howard knew what was at stake if they played well enough to earn a tour card in the 90-hole tournament. Averyhardt and Howard, among the few black women in professional golf, were also aware that others were watching. When she earned her tour card for the 2011 season, Averyhardt became the fourth black player in L.P.G.A. history. She tried to play down her achievement while showing appreciation for the many fans who came to see her play. Financial struggles and injuries left her wondering if she could pursue her dream, but Averyhardt said her hope was restored by the minority youths who looked up to her during junior clinics and pro-ams. “Typically, people who come from small towns or urban areas want to get out, or they want to do something great for their lives or for their families,” said Averyhardt, a 26-year-old from Flint, Mich., whose mother is Mexican and father is African-American. “I feel like I can be a testament to that.” Howard, an 18-year-old rookie, also hopes to encourage young players. Her younger sister Robbi has emerged as a top junior player, and Howard wondered if they could do for women’s golf what the Williams sisters have done for women’s tennis. “I don’t really look at color, but a lot of people ask about it because I’m one of only a few African-Americans in women’s golf,” said Howard, a Philadelphia native who lives with her parents and three younger siblings in Bradenton, Fla. “I have high expectations because it keeps me driving toward my goals, and I want to try to inspire people.” Averyhardt lost her L.P.G.A. status last December and returned to Q-School this year hoping to regain her tour card. Howard did not earn L.P.G.A. membership last December and aimed to qualify after playing a full 2012 season on the L.P.G.A’s development circuit, the Symetra Tour. Among those monitoring their progress is Sisters Across America, a nonprofit organization that was founded in 2006 to mentor young minority women seeking to play professional golf. Averyhardt, who began playing the game when she was 10, was the first golfer sponsored by the group, which helped pay her tour expenses and tournament entry fees from March 2009 through July. She has aged out of the program, but Howard became eligible when she turned 18 and will receive support from Sisters Across America next season. “Ever since we started supporting Shasta, I wanted to provide the mentoring, financial support or whatever she needs to play on the L.P.G.A. Tour,” said Deloris Jones, the organization’s president. “The same is true with Ginger.” The organization holds two tournaments each year to raise money for the sponsorship program. It also hopes to attract sponsors to help cover expenses incurred by program participants. With corporate support, the group could provide up to $80,000 per player each year, Jones said. The organization also functions as a nationwide network. Whenever Averyhardt was traveling and playing tournaments, the group would ask members in the area to provide support, housing and transportation. Without the support of Sisters Across America, Averyhardt said, she would not have been able to begin her professional golf career. Averyhardt and Howard took different paths to the final qualifying tournament. Averyhardt, who earned an accounting degree from Jackson State in 2008, struggled as an L.P.G.A. rookie in 2011. Without full status, she bounced between the Symetra and L.P.G.A. tours. She missed cuts and produced spotty performances. Just as Averyhardt gained L.P.G.A. membership, tendinitis flared in her left wrist, a result of swing changes. Her new swing placed pressure on her slender 6-foot-1-inch frame and weak upper body. “It was very painful, but I felt obligated to play,” Averyhardt said. “I should have taken medical leave, but I felt like I was playing for a lot of other people.” Averyhardt rested and rehabilitated her wrist last winter, and in 2012 she had her best season, with a tie for fourth and four top-25 finishes on the Symetra Tour. She earned $14,362 in 15 events and was named the tour’s most improved player. She also ranked third in driving distance with an average of 268 yards and finished sixth in birdies with 132 for the season. “This was a rebuilding year in which I had to reassess why I’m playing,” Averyhardt said. “I put so much pressure on myself to play well and to play for other people instead of saying, ‘I love this sport, I’m good at it and I’m playing for me.’ ” Howard, who began playing golf at age 6 and graduated from home schooling in May, skipped college to take a quicker path to the L.P.G.A. She played in 16 Symetra tournaments this year with her father, Robert, as her chaperon and caddie. For many of those events, her 4-year-old brother, Julian, also traveled with them. It was not always optimal for Howard to learn to play week after week of tournament golf with a little brother in tow. “He slept O.K., but he’s not very good at watching me play during the tournaments,” Howard said. She arrived on the Symetra Tour with solid amateur credentials, as a member of the Junior Ryder Cup and Canon Cup East teams in 2010. After turning professional, she won eight tournaments in 2011 on a Florida minitour. She was also the medalist in last year’s sectional tournament at the L.P.G.A. Q-School. Howard’s best Symetra Tour finish this year was a tie for second at the Riviera Nayarit Classic in April. But then she missed five tournament cuts as she wrestled with the learning curve and experimental equipment. “It was my first time on a real golf tour and it was a great experience,” said Howard, who earned $16,863 in 16 events and led the Symetra Tour with a putting average of 29.19 strokes per round. “I feel like I got a lot stronger mentally and physically this year.” The top 40 finishers at the qualifying tournament earned tour cards. Averyhardt squeezed in as she tied for 39th. She posted a final-round score of three-under-par 69; on the last hole, her chip shot rolled 25 feet downhill and fell into the cup for a birdie. “I told my caddie after the third round that I was not leaving here without some kind of L.P.G.A. status,” said Averyhardt, a fourth-year pro. “But I didn’t know that I had to birdie the last hole to get my card.” Averyhardt hopes to find sponsorship that will enable her to play in the L.P.G.A.’s Monday qualifying tournaments each week. Once again, she will split her time between the L.P.G.A. and Symetra tours, but she will focus on reaching the highest level and staying there. Howard missed earning her tour card by eight strokes. Now her goal is to finish among the top 10 on the Symetra Tour’s money list to earn full membership on the L.P.G.A. Tour for 2014. “Unfortunately, I’ll be back on the Symetra Tour next year,” she said. “But fortunately, I learned a lot this year that will help in 2013.” Sisters Across America is hopeful that Averyhardt and Howard can help pave the way for other minority women. Another top black player, Cheyenne Woods, missed advancing to the final round of the qualifying tournament. But as the niece of Tiger Woods, she will probably earn some sponsor exemptions. “Golf is tough, and neither Shasta nor Ginger played as they had anticipated at this year’s L.P.G.A. Q-School,” said Jones, the Sisters Across America president. “But the fact is, they were there. And that’s where you start.”",

    "source": "Murder Confession Prompts Calls in Texas for Recording Interrogations <eos> LIVINGSTON, Tex. — Max Soffar slurred his words in 1980 as he confessed to shooting two teenagers while robbing a Houston bowling alley, a confession that can be heard over the hisses and crackles of an audiotape. Only two hours of at least 26 hours of questioning over three days were recorded, according to the police officers who were at the interrogation. Three decades and two trials later, Mr. Soffar, 57, maintains that he never committed the crimes — he says he confessed to shooting the two teenagers while trying to implicate someone else in the shootings at the bowling alley, in which three people were killed and another was injured. But Mr. Soffar also says he only has faint memories of the interrogation. The investigators “took full advantage of someone who had no idea of the danger of the situation,” Mr. Soffar said recently from death row. Prosecutors said that the evidence against Mr. Soffar was solid. Mr. Soffar’s lawyers say his case highlights a broader debate about false confessions, and as they ask the United States Supreme Court to look at the case, Texas lawmakers are renewing a push to require police officers to record interviews in cases of violent crime. On July 13, 1980, Arden Alane Felsher, 17, Greg Garner, 18, Stephen Allen Sims, 25, and Tommy Lee Temple, 17, were shot at the bowling alley. Mr. Garner survived with severe injuries. A few weeks later, the police stopped Mr. Soffar for speeding and arrested him for driving a stolen motorcycle. On the way to the police station, Mr. Soffar said that he had information about the bowling alley murders. “I got involved in something I had no business opening my mouth about,” he said in the recent interview. He was charged with the murders after his confession. Mr. Soffar was found guilty of shooting all four people and received the death penalty in 1981, but his conviction was reversed in 2004 when the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decided that his first lawyer had been ineffective. He was convicted again in 2006 and sentenced to death. Lyn McClellan, who prosecuted Mr. Soffar at the 2006 retrial, said that the confession included “information that only the killer would know.” “I think this audiotape is the key to the whole case,” Mr. McClellan said. “He tells them how this bowling alley murder went down.” Of the police officers who interviewed Mr. Soffar, one has since died and another declined to discuss the case. A third, Detective Gil Schultz, said that the confessions were “free and voluntary.” Richard A. Leo, who teaches at the University of San Francisco School of Law and has written several books on police interrogation procedures, analyzed Mr. Soffar’s tape and determined that officers in the case used verbal techniques like accusation, forceful pressure, repetition and confrontation. All of these, Dr. Leo wrote in an affidavit, “create a risk of eliciting false confessions when misapplied to the innocent.” Mr. Soffar, sleep-deprived and coming down from drug use, was particularly susceptible, Dr. Leo said. Detective Schultz said that he was kind to Mr. Soffar during the interrogation. “I never raised my voice to that man,” Detective Schultz said. “I treated him like a human being.” Last Friday, Mr. Soffar asked the Supreme Court to determine if the Court of Criminal Appeals, Texas’ highest criminal court, has an effective standard for judging whether his trial lawyer, Kathryn M. Kase, represented him adequately in the 2006 trial. He and his advocates say she should have found an expert like Dr. Leo to cast doubt on the confession. Ms. Kase said that her strategy was to introduce news articles that showed that Mr. Soffar possibly learned the details of the crime from the news media, but that the judge barred the articles from being presented. In 2009 the Court of Criminal Appeals upheld Mr. Soffar’s conviction, though Judge Cathy Cochran wrote that the confessions appeared “to be a tale told by one who heard about the robbery-murders rather than by one who committed them.” Mr. Soffar’s lawyers said that neither jury was allowed to see evidence that another man, Paul Reid, might have been involved. Mr. Reid is now on Tennessee’s death row , having received seven death sentences. He lived in Houston at the time of the bowling alley killings. An employee at the bowling alley said in an affidavit that a man resembling Mr. Reid got into an argument with one of the victims and threatened him a week before the killings. The employee said the police showed him a picture of Mr. Reid during the investigation and he identified him as the man who got into the argument. Mr. Soffar’s lawyers and Detective Schultz agree that much of the debate over the interrogations could have been avoided if the police had recorded them, though they say that it was not technologically practical at the time. Now, with inexpensive digital recording, Texas legislators are renewing a push to require the police to record interrogations. According to the National Registry of Exonerations , at least seven wrongful convictions in Texas have involved false confessions. Senator Rodney Ellis, Democrat of Houston, has filed a bill requiring the taping of interrogations for violent crimes. Ms. Kase, who helped write an earlier version of Mr. Ellis’s bill, said this was one of many cases that led her to conclude that the police should be recorded so they do not “prop somebody up and record the ‘Yes, I did it’ statement after hours of interrogation.” Police officers and prosecutors are split on whether recordings should be required. Lon Craft of the Texas Municipal Police Association called the requirement “another attempt for the defense bar to find new ways to object to lawfully obtained confessions.” Part of the concern, said Shannon Edmonds, the legislative director of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association , is that in situations where there was no recording, prosecutors might be unable to use a “lawful and voluntary confession” as evidence. His organization has not taken a position on the bill. Detective Schultz said recordings would be “fantastic” and could help protect police officers and lawyers from accusations of wrongdoing. But he added that recordings would not have mattered in Mr. Soffar’s case. “I’m absolutely positive he’s guilty,” he said. Brian Stull, a former lawyer for Mr. Soffar, said that there would always be unresolved issues in the case, because without recordings “you have to trust what the police officer says.” “They may be telling the truth,” he said, “but there are things that could just be lost.”",

    "source": "Defense Rests in Killings of Detectives <eos> Crowds of police detectives, assistant district attorneys and uniformed officers returned yesterday to the trial of Marlon Legere, 30, who is accused of killing two detectives in September 2004. Their appearance repeated a display of solidarity made three weeks ago when the trial began, but this time they heard a full-throated, wide-ranging defense of Mr. Legere. There was nowhere to sit in the courtroom. There were many folded arms. Mr. Legere is accused of first-degree murder in the killings of the detectives, Robert L. Parker and Patrick H. Rafferty, who confronted him outside his mother's house. Prosecutors have portrayed an argument between mother and son that left Mr. Legere riled, defiant and reasonably aware that she would call the police. Mr. Legere's lawyers have built his case in a seemingly lean manner: Ivan A. Vogel's opening remarks were brief, and Wayne C. Bodden rested for the defense after a single day of testimony. But when Mr. Bodden jumped to his feet at the defense table yesterday in his closing argument, he began a speech that would last more than two and a half hours, not counting an interruption for a lunch break. Taking a combative tone, he circled the chronology of the case, arguing credibility, context and perceptions. Facing jurors and away from the audience, he spoke of an overzealous, narrow investigation and accused the police of witness intimidation. \"They're going to tell you Marlon terrorized her,\" Mr. Bodden said, referring to Mr. Legere's mother. \"Well, the police terrorized that lady.\" Mr. Bodden repeatedly revisited Mr. Legere's state of mind on the night of the shooting, suggesting that Mr. Legere did not recognize the men confronting him as police officers and thought he was being robbed. On Monday, Justice Anne G. Feldman of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn said she would instruct the jury to consider evidence of justification, a modern term for self-defense. The standard for justification shifted after rulings in the case of Bernard Goetz, the so-called subway vigilante, legal experts said. Jurors are now told to consider a defendant's education, background and prior experiences, so this jury is likely to be told to consider whether a reasonable person would feel imperiled in Mr. Legere's situation if that reasonable person was Mr. Legere. To that end, Mr. Bodden sought to convey a sense of street knowledge as he spoke to the jurors. Dressed in a necktie, glasses and a silver watch, he used the words \"folks,\" y'all,\" \"cops\" and \"whassup,\" and at one point he disparaged the opera. He said that on the night of the shooting, Mr. Legere had no reason to believe that his mother had called the police. \"He went to the car happy, ignorant of Detective Parker but happy,\" Mr. Bodden said. \"What you have is a frustrated cat and an ignorant mouse. Bad combination. Tragic combination.\" Acknowledging his broader audience, the men with badges standing in a line at the back of the courtroom, Mr. Bodden asked the jury to follow the law. \"You told me you wouldn't be affected by the people in the audience,\" Mr. Bodden said. \"You wouldn't be scared.\"",

    "source": "As Clashes Continue, Egypt Soccer Riot Becomes Metaphor for Government Failure <eos> CAIRO — Clashes between protesters and security forces left five people dead on Friday in an escalation of violence that threatened to undo Egypt ’s halting steps toward stability after the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak one year ago. The protests began Thursday in anger at the police for failing to prevent a post-match fight between rival groups of soccer fans in Port Said in which 70 people were killed on Wednesday night. But as the protests continued for a second day, the original riot had become a metaphor for the failure of the military-led government to resolve the complaints that fuel recurring street violence, including brutal but capricious police officers, a lack of accountability and implausible attempts to blame mysterious third parties for social unrest. If the ruling military council cannot control a soccer game, many asked, how can they run a country of more than 80 million? “If you can’t secure a match, tell me how will you secure Egypt?” demonstrators chanted on their way to the headquarters of the Interior Ministry. The violence erupted just days after two much-anticipated and potentially combustible occasions managed to pass in Egypt with unexpected calm: the first anniversary of the revolt against Mr. Mubarak and the installation of a new Parliament. Now, though, the soccer riot has come to epitomize a new wave of miscellaneous crimes around the country, from a bank robbery in Cairo last week to the kidnapping of two American tourists and their guide for six hours in the Sinai on Friday. Addressing the resulting public anger at the police and the military-led government is the first challenge for the new Parliament and its Islamist leaders. Initially led by die-hard soccer fans — known as ultras — the protests that began around the country on Thursday were the first since Mr. Mubarak’s ouster that at least some demonstrators began not in peace but with the avowed intent to inflict violence on security forces. By Friday, however, the ultras still on the front lines had been joined by thousands of other protesters. They marched after prayers and chanted for the end of military rule. In both Suez and Cairo, rock-throwing protesters continued to surround and attack the Interior Ministry headquarters for a second day, after battling through the night. And in both places, the police fought back with heavy, round-the-clock volleys of tear gas, then with birdshot. In Suez, hospital officials reported wounds from live ammunition as well. Three protesters were killed there, hospital officials said, and one was killed in Cairo. An army officer was also killed during the fighting in Cairo when he was accidentally run over by a security truck. The fighting in Cairo resembled battles fought in some of the same streets in November, when more than 40 people died, and again in December, when more than 15 more were killed. Whether because of the depth of the public anger over the soccer riot or because of the potential supervision of the new Parliament, the security forces seemed, if anything, more restrained. But the protesters quickly fell back into the patterns of previous battles. Vendors sold hospital masks to protect against tear gas. Young women dispensed vinegar and other home remedies. And after working through the night, gleeful protesters partially tore down a wall of concrete blocks that the military had erected to keep them from the Interior Ministry. Racing to respond to the outcry over the soccer riot, officials of the military-led government announced that it had imposed travel bans on certain police officials under scrutiny in an investigation into who was responsible for security at the match. The ruling military council, which has pledged to hand over power after the writing of a constitution and the election of a president by the end of June, urged in a statement that Egyptians “confront the attempts at escalation by foreign and domestic parties.” The council did not explain who those parties were. Leaders of the week-old Parliament, which will return Saturday to another emergency session about the riot, indicated Friday that they might take legal action against the officials responsible. The Web page of the Muslim Brotherhood ’s political party, which leads the chamber, linked to a Parliament Web site explaining that “in response to the massacre of Port Said,” Parliament had decided to “reactivate” a law allowing the trial of cabinet ministers by a tribunal of lawmakers and judges. If approved by Parliament, the law could be applied retroactively even to Mr. Mubarak, the explanation continued. A senior figure in the Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party, Mohamed El Beltagy, said top security and intelligence officials would be called Saturday to testify about the events and could be asked to resign if they failed to identify the perpetrators. He said that the chaotic security in the country was a deliberate ploy by the country’s military rulers to build support for an extension of their power. Other Muslim Brotherhood statements suggested that the riot in Port Said had been orchestrated by former officials of the Mubarak government or unnamed “foreign fingers.” In Port Said on Friday, a crowd gathered around the cafe of a former Mubarak ally, Gamal Omar, after rumors suggested that he and an ally had hired hundreds of people to instigate the riot. The same rumors, without evidence, appeared on the Web site of the Freedom and Justice Party . In the shifting crowds that filled the streets of downtown Cairo, advancing and retreating with the flow of tear gas, demonstrators said they had little faith in either the military-led government or the new Parliament. Ahmed Hussein, 27, had come with several others to try to stop the violence by kneeling in prayer between the security forces and the protesters. But he said they fled after the police fired tear gas at their backs. “I have no idea how this situation could be resolved,” he said. On the corner, a child of about 12 was wearing a makeshift cape made from the flag of the Cairo soccer team Al Ahly and resisting advice to get home to safety. “I am responsible for getting the rights of my brothers who died,” he said, referring to his fellow fans killed in Port Said. “I will avenge them.” A well-known activist, Tarek Shalaby, 27, said the Muslim Brotherhood party now running Parliament “does not want to change anything.” “They are a bunch of businessmen,” he said. “They just want the economy to grow.” An armed power like the military council, Mr. Shalaby argued, “would never surrender its full authority without a struggle.” The only hope, he said, was more strikes and protests. “Politics is in the street.”",

    "source": "Ogres, Dragons, Medusa and More, All in an Epic on a 4-Inch Screen <eos> The hand-held Sony PlayStationPortable game console can barely contain the action-adventure game God of War: Chains of Olympus. With its ogres and dragons, stone temples and massive ancient machinery, the game feels as though at any moment it will burst through the four-inch screen and bring hellfire and destruction to your sofa. Chains of Olympus is a prequel to the two PlayStation 2 God of War games. The brutal antihero Kratos must do the bidding of the fickle Greek gods, hoping they will release him from the memories of his unbearable sins. The gods demand Kratos kill a city-ravaging dragon, but that’s only the beginning of his troubles. The game assures the player of its determination to match the scale of the other games early on when Kratos’s battle with a monster 10 times his size is interrupted by a dragon 10 times its size killing the monster. The game faithfully emulates the savage, macho tone of the previous games. It is not for children or the faint-of-heart classics professor. Kratos beats a king to death with a chest of his own gold, murders chained residents of Tartarus to gain health and, early on, has sex with two women (which involves the player hitting keys on the console while watching a candle shake as the three characters moan off camera). It is remarkable how much Chains plays like its big-console forebears. Once again you madly push buttons to swing the blades, chained to Kratos’s wrists, through ogres or to grab a snakelike Medusa and snap its neck. Kratos gains more weapons as he progresses, acquiring a metal fist that can punch through walls and gaining the ability to call forth a fiery monster that can incinerate nearby attackers. The game also beautifully recreates the look of the series. I played much of Chains through my television, which can be done with the newer PSP-2000 and a component cable, and, even blown up for the big screen, the game looks nearly as good as the original God of War. Chains is certainly the biggest, baddest game ever to hit the PSP, but it is still not quite so big and bad as previous games for other platforms. The story is not as grand, the puzzles aren’t nearly as ingenious and the game is at times too fond of making Kratos backtrack through areas, probably because there is a limit to how much you can squeeze onto those little PSP discs. But since God of War and God of War II are two of the greatest games ever made, saying Chains is almost as good is still high praise. It is surprising that it is even possible to create such an epic game on the PSP. It is almost equally surprising that no one seems to be able to do the same thing for the Wii, whose games are often fun but usually feel more like short jaunts than grand voyages. The closest thing to a Wii epic since The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, which came out in 2006, is the action-role playing game Dragon Quest Swords: The Mask Queen and the Tower of Mirrors. Unfortunately the uninspired plot makes a battle against a great evil feel as vital as a trip to the mall. In Swords, you play the son of a famous hero who long ago vanquished an evil overlord. Everything’s been hunky-dory in the kingdom since, but now the queen has taken to avoiding people and wearing a strange mask. This familiar setup starts a by-the-books story devoid of interesting characters or any real surprises. But it does offer the opportunity to explore forests and flatten monsters. Like most Wii games, the main focus of Swords is on the Wii’s motion-sensitive controller, and in that aspect the game is quite successful. You can slash the remote through the air and see a slit of light across the screen that will chop enemies in half. Properly timed slashes can also be used to hurl projectiles back at their senders. You can raise a shield to block attacks. You are accompanied by a companion who casts spells, some healing and some more warlike. When you’ve acquired enough energy you can make a tremendous thrust that will wipe out a host of monsters. It’s certainly not the most elaborate battle system, and is clearly aimed more at the Wii’s casual-game fan than hard-core role-playing gamer, but it is fun. Enemies are of the goofy, cartoonish variety usually found in Dragon Quest games, and the game’s backgrounds are pretty, as Wii games go. As in any role-playing game, you become more powerful both through experience and through improving your weapons and armor. Upgrading your sword involves collecting items that are then used by a blacksmith to enhance the sword. To find these items and to build up your strength to deal with particularly strong monsters, you need to replay some of the game’s eight levels, sometimes several times. I have never been a big fan of viewing the same scenery while battling the same enemies in the same places, but levels can be traversed fairly quickly, so it’s a relatively painless procedure. By the time I reached the final bad guy, who slaughtered me quickly, I simply didn’t feel like replaying a lot of levels just to collect the items to upgrade my sword yet again. Frankly, I didn’t care if the game’s two-dimensional characters lived or died. I had no problem leaving the evil overlord to wreak havoc. Still, a Wii game that at least goes through the motions of telling a story is something; I suppose half an epic is better than none. I hope that someday game makers will offer a Wii adventure as compelling as God of War: Chains of Olympus. And if a Kratos jumped out of the screen ready to wreak havoc, you could just hand him the Wii remote; he might find swinging it around so much fun that he’d completely forget to destroy your sofa.",

    "source": "U.S. Says 3 N.Y.U. Scientists Took Bribes to Reveal Work to China <eos> It was, the chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan said on Monday, “a case of inviting and paying for foxes in the henhouse.” Three researchers at the New York University School of Medicine who specialized in magnetic resonance imaging technology had been working on research sponsored by a grant from the National Institutes of Health. But, prosecutors charged on Monday, the three had their eyes on other business as well. They conspired to take bribes from a Chinese medical imaging company and a Chinese-sponsored research institute to share nonpublic information about their N.Y.U. work, according to the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan. The defendants, all Chinese citizens, included Yudong Zhu , 44, of Scarsdale, N.Y., an associate professor in the school’s radiology department who was described by the authorities as “an accomplished researcher and innovator.” He was hired by the university around 2008 to teach and conduct research related to innovations in M.R.I. technology, the authorities said. After the National Institutes of Health awarded the university millions of dollars over five years to pay for Professor Zhu’s research, he arranged for the two other defendants to move to New York from China to work with him, prosecutors said. He also arranged for them to receive financial support from an executive of the Chinese imaging company who was also affiliated with the government-sponsored institute, officials said. The two other defendants are Xing Yang, 31, and Ye Li, also 31, both of Hartsdale, N.Y. They were each described by N.Y.U. as research engineers at the medical school. The support they received included graduate school tuition for Mr. Yang, a rental apartment for Mr. Li and, for both, travel between China and New York, prosecutors said. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney, who announced the charges with George Venizelos, the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s New York office, said the defendants had “colluded with representatives from a Chinese government entity and a direct competitor of the university for which they worked to illegally acquire N.I.H.-funded research for the benefit of those entities.” N.Y.U. said in a statement that it was “deeply disappointed by the news of the alleged conduct by its employees.” “Through our internal review processes,” it said, “we became aware of possible irregularities pursuant to research being conducted through a grant from the N.I.H. to develop new M.R.I. technologies.” The university said that it had alerted the authorities and continued to cooperate fully with the investigation. Dr. Zhu and Mr. Yang were both arrested on Sunday and ordered released on bond by a magistrate judge on Monday. All three defendants were charged with one count of commercial bribery conspiracy; Dr. Zhu was also charged with one count of falsification of records. A prosecutor said in court that Dr. Zhu had admitted to the F.B.I. that he had received almost $500,000 in the scheme. Dr. Zhu’s lawyer, Robert M. Baum, said in court that N.Y.U. had recruited his client because he was “one of the world’s renowned experts in M.R.I. technology.” Mr. Li was believed to have flown to China before charges were brought, Mr. Bharara’s office said.",

    "source": "Kerry Says U.S. Is Open to Talking to Iran, Even as Ayatollah Is Dismissive <eos> PARIS — The Obama administration is open to talking with Iran on the security crisis in Iraq, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday, even after Iran’s supreme leader angrily said Tehran would no longer discuss Middle East issues with the United States. Mr. Kerry was speaking as 26 nations, Iran conspicuously not among them, gathered in Paris for an international conference on helping the new government in Baghdad fight the extremist Sunni group, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. He acknowledged that he had opposed Iran’s attendance, but he stressed that the United States was still prepared to speak with the Iranians about Iraq and Syria, including on the margins of the negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program that will resume in New York on Thursday. Just because the Iranians were not invited to the conference, Mr. Kerry said, “doesn’t mean that we are opposed to the idea of communicating to find out if they will come on board or under what circumstances or whether there is the possibility of a change.” Image President François Hollande of France greeted President Fuad Masum of Iraq at the Elysée Palace in Paris on Monday. Credit John Schults/Reuters In Tehran, the tone was quite different. Iranian officials gave out flurries of statements to local reporters on Monday, saying that they had rejected multiple invitations by the United States to join the coalition. On Monday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s supreme leader, issued a scathing and, at times, sarcastic statement on the day he left the hospital after prostate surgery. In remarks posted on his personal website, he said he had enjoyed his recent time in the hospital because he had “a hobby,” which was “listening to Americans making statements on combating ISIS — it was really amusing.” Such statements, he added, are “absurd, hollow and biased.” The Obama administration has long sought to separate the nuclear talks with Iran from discussions of regional issues, out of concern that Tehran might seek concessions in the nuclear negotiations in return for cooperating on Syria or Iran. Mr. Kerry also acknowledged that the administration’s previous effort, led by the deputy secretary of state, William J. Burns, to draw Iran into quiet talks on Iraq and other regional issues had not been productive. “The confidential discussions never got to that sort of substance,” Mr. Kerry told reporters. When ISIS burst onto the global stage this summer, some analysts speculated that Tehran and Washington might be able to narrow their deep differences over Iraq, Syria and the Middle East. The same thought occurred after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when the two antagonists shared a mutual antipathy for the Taliban in Afghanistan. Image In Tehran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, left the hospital after prostate surgery. Credit Office of the Supreme Leader of Iran, via Associated Press For a number of reasons, the fissures have not narrowed appreciably. First, in mobilizing international support for Iraq, Mr. Kerry has turned to Sunni Arab nations, which remain deeply suspicious of Iran’s intentions. Both King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and top officials from the United Arab Emirates made clear to Mr. Kerry that they would not attend the Paris conference if Iran was present. So when the French raised the prospect of a role for Iran, Mr. Kerry was bluntly opposed. For the Obama administration, it came down to a choice between the coalition it is trying to assemble to support Iraq’s new government politically and militarily and an Iran whose allies include two longtime American adversaries: President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and the anti-American Shiite militias in Iraq. Second, Iran fears that the coalition Mr. Kerry is assembling will ultimately undermine Mr. Assad, who has been receiving extensive financial and military support from Tehran. To counter Iran in Syria, the administration is pressing ahead with its plan to train moderate Syrian rebels at bases in Saudi Arabia. Finally, any form of partnership with the “Great Satan,” particularly one in which the United States plays a decisive role, is hard for Ayatollah Khamenei and his hard-line supporters to stomach. In pushing back, Iran appears to be arguing that it would not want to be part of any club that would not welcome it as a charter member. A Rogue State Along Two Rivers The victories gained by the militant group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria were built on months of maneuvering along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. “Even the American deputy foreign minister, who is a woman and everyone knows her, had repeated this request in a meeting with Mr. Araghchi again,” Ayatollah Khamenei said, referring to Wendy R. Sherman, the under secretary of state for political affairs, and Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister. “But Mr. Araghchi also rejected her request.” Iran appeared to be signaling that it has a coalition of its own. Along with the ayatollah, a major Iranian-based Iraqi Shiite militia also bitterly assailed the United States on Monday. “We will not fight alongside the American troops under any kind of conditions whatsoever,” the militia, Kataib Hezbollah, said in a statement on its website, adding that its only contact with the American military would be “if we fight each other.” The fiery words from Tehran appeared to have little or no effect on the international conference. The 26 nations that participated issued a statement pledging their support for the new Iraqi government in its fight against ISIS, including military assistance. But the statement made no mention of Iran or any role it might play. “They committed to supporting the new Iraqi government in its fight against Daesh, by any means necessary, including appropriate military assistance,” said the statement, using the Iraqi name for ISIS. It added that the aid would be “in accordance with international law and without jeopardizing civilian security.”",

    "source": "Consumer Borrowing Falls as Less Is Put on Credit Cards <eos> WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans cut back on their credit card use in July for a second consecutive month, suggesting that many remain cautious in the face of high unemployment and slow growth. Total consumer borrowing dipped $3.3 billion in July from June, to a seasonally adjusted $2.705 trillion, the Federal Reserve reported Monday. The drop in credit card debt offset a small rise in a measure of auto and student loans . The Fed also said Americans had borrowed much more than previously estimated after it revised consumer borrowing data back to December 2010. June’s figure was increased to $2.708 trillion, or $130 billion more than initially thought. That is also well above prerecession levels. Consumer debt declined even though Americans increased their spending in July by the most in five months, according to government data released last week. Consumers have been using credit cards much less since the 2008 financial crisis. Four years ago, Americans had $1.03 trillion in credit card debt, a record high. In July, it was $850.7 billion, 17 percent lower. During that same time, student loan debt has increased sharply. The category that includes auto and student loans, along with other loans for items like boats, has jumped to $1.85 trillion from $1.56 trillion in July 2008. The weak job market is putting more pressure on the Federal Reserve to provide more help to the anemic economy. The Fed’s policy makers will meet Wednesday and Thursday to consider whether to take further action at this time. The economy is growing too slowly to bolster business and consumer confidence and spur sustained gains in spending and hiring. Overall economic growth slowed to an annual rate of just 1.7 percent in the April-June quarter and analysts do not expect much of a pickup for the rest of the year. Over all, Americans have been steadily paring debt since the financial crisis. Household debt, including mortgages and home equity lines of credit, has declined for 16 straight quarters to $12.9 trillion in March, according to a separate Fed survey on consumer finances. That is down from $13.8 trillion in March 2008.",

    "source": "U.S. Identifies Citizens Joining Rebels in Syria, Including ISIS <eos> WASHINGTON — American intelligence and law enforcement agencies have identified nearly a dozen Americans who have traveled to Syria to fight for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the militant group that the Obama administration says poses the greatest threat to the United States since Al Qaeda before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. As ISIS has seized large expanses of territory in recent months, it has drawn more foreign men to Syria, requiring more American and European law enforcement resources in the attempt to stop the flow of fighters, senior American officials said. And as a result of the increasing numbers of men, ISIS is now recruiting foreign women as jihadist wives. ISIS has become more attractive to would-be militants because, unlike Al Qaeda, it has seized territory that it rules by strict Islamic law. “ISIS is able to hold itself up as the true jihad,” said a senior American official. “They’re saying: ‘Look at what we are doing, what we’re accomplishing. We’re the new face. We’re not just talking about it. We’re doing it.’ ” ISIS’ attraction to some is based on its reputation for brutality. On Thursday, that reputation grew worse when it was revealed that it had waterboarded four hostages early in their captivity — including the American journalist James Foley, who was beheaded this month. Over all, American intelligence officials said the number of Americans who have joined rebel groups in Syria — not just ISIS — had nearly doubled since January. The officials now believe that more than 100 Americans have fought alongside groups there since the civil war began three years ago. The agencies have been able to specifically identify Americans fighting for ISIS based on intelligence gathered from travel records, family members, intercepted electronic communications, social media postings and surveillance of Americans overseas who had expressed interest in going to Syria, the officials said. A Rogue State Along Two Rivers The victories gained by the militant group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria were built on months of maneuvering along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Many more Europeans have joined the fight against President Bashar al-Assad — more than 1,000, according to many estimates. The British government has identified about 500 of its citizens who have gone to Syria, according to a senior British official. About half have returned to Britain, and a small number have died on the battlefield, the official said. Senior American officials acknowledge that as the conflict in Syria and Iraq drags on, it is becoming harder to track Americans who have traveled there. In many instances, the American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are learning that Americans are there only long after they have arrived. In the latest example of how difficult it is for the United States to track its citizens, the F.B.I. on Thursday was trying to verify reports that two more Americans had been killed fighting for ISIS in Syria. Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict in 2011, at least four Americans have died fighting for rebel groups, including Douglas McAuthur McCain, 33, a Minnesota man who was fighting for ISIS when he was killed last weekend by a rival group backed by the United States. Another challenge that the intelligence and law enforcement authorities say they face is a difference from previous conflicts: The Americans who have traveled to Syria to fight have little in common. The conflict has attracted both men and women, including some who were raised as Muslims and others who converted from Christianity, and they have come from different parts of the United States. One trend the authorities have detected in recent months is that the American recruits are younger. They are now mostly in their late teens or early 20s, the officials said. The territorial gains by ISIS, and its attempt to govern towns and cities in eastern Syria and western Iraq, have forced it to recruit foreigners not just for the battlefield. The group has tried to lure doctors, oil field workers and engineers to live in, and help run, the caliphate it claims to have established, according to the officials. Video Background on ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Credit Credit Reuters The F.B.I.’s psychological analysts at Quantico, Va., armed with court-approved powers, are increasingly monitoring the activities of Americans who have expressed extremist views in jihadist chat rooms and on websites. It is an effort to chart their radicalization, law enforcement officials said. But ISIS and other violent Islamist groups operating in Syria have not been deterred by the American efforts. In Minneapolis, for example, Abdirizak Bihi, director of the Somali Education and Social Advocacy Center, said that young Somali women were being recruited by violent Islamist groups to support Syrian militants. Mr. Bihi said that despite efforts to combat the recruiting, multiple Somali families in the city had “lost their girls to Syria.” “We are frustrated because nobody’s helping us,” he said. “We’re losing everything we have.” In Europe, where larger numbers are leaving for Syria, officials share the same concern and are working closely with the American authorities to coordinate measures to stem the flow and track those who return. But the ISIS-led fighters who swept into Mosul, Iraq, in June and advanced south to within 60 miles of Baghdad, the capital, have built considerable momentum in recruitment. “There’s certainly been a P.R. boon for them,” said Matthew Levitt, director of the Stein Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. New attention was focused on ISIS on Thursday when The Washington Post reported that the group had waterboarded at least four of its Western hostages. The hostages were tortured in other ways as well, American officials said, but the waterboarding disclosure was considered significant because the practice was used during the George W. Bush administration on detainees held in the fight against terrorism. Some senior American officials warned that Americans might face the same treatment if they were captured abroad.",

    "source": "PGA Tour Rookie Smylie Kaufman Strives to Aid Louisiana Flood Victims <eos> NORTON, Mass. — The elite of the PGA Tour, the 30 fortunate players who qualify for the season-ending Tour Championship, will have a week of rest to prepare for the Sept. 22-25 tournament. Smylie Kaufman may well be one of those fellows. But he will not spend the third weekend of September with his feet on the couch watching his alma mater, Louisiana State, play Mississippi State in football. He is planning on being in the Baton Rouge area, though not for a game. Rather, he will be raising money for flood victims as well as heightening awareness of their plight. Three other PGA Tour players who also went to L.S.U. will join Kaufman. They will try to help the many children who have been displaced because their schools were flooded. The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said recently that the state had sustained more than $8.7 billion in damage from floods last month. “A lot of schools down there got extremely flooded,” Kaufman said. “Kids are exchanging schools. It’s unusual. We’re going to try and help out at the high schools, middle schools, elementary schools. Whatever it is they need us to do to help the kids get back on their feet.” He added: “We can’t help everybody. But we’re going to try to do the best with the time we have.” The gesture is all the more meaningful given that Kaufman and everyone else in the Deutsche Bank Championship field will be teeing off in threesomes early Monday to try to get the final round completed before the remnants of Hurricane Hermine arrive at T.P.C. Boston. Kaufman is in contention for his second tour win, part of a three-way tie for third at 11 under par, four strokes behind the leader, Paul Casey. Brian Harman is at 12 under. Casey shot his third straight 66 during Sunday’s third round, capped by an eagle on No. 18 after his 232-yard approach shot landed two and a half feet from the hole. Casey has won only once on the PGA Tour, in April 2009 in a playoff at the Shell Houston Open. He was 59th in the FedEx Cup standings heading into the tournament. “To be sitting here with a 66, obviously, I’m over the moon,” Casey said. A leaderboard lacking in marquee names got one major boost on what the pros call moving day. Rory McIlroy nearly had a two on No. 18 and finished with a five-under 66 to get to nine under for the tournament. Louis Oosthuizen, the 2010 British Open champion who is looking for his first win on American soil, also made a big move, shooting a seven-under 64 to wind up at nine under. They were joined by Justin Rose, the Olympic gold medalist, and Tony Finau. The P.G.A. Championship winner Jimmy Walker is tied with Kaufman at 11 under, but Walker’s fellow Ryder Cup team members Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth stumbled to over-par rounds. Ryan Moore is at 10 under. When most people last saw Kaufman, a PGA Tour rookie, he was in the final group of the Masters on the last day with Spieth. While Spieth’s meltdown on No. 12 at Augusta very likely cost him the tournament, Kaufman played like a rookie, finishing with an 81. In his next 11 tournaments, he missed the cut eight times. His best finish was a tie for 10th in the Quicken Loans National in June. But he said he had made one discovery as a rookie: He does not need to be perfect to win. He realized that in his victory at the Shriners Hospital for Children Open in Las Vegas last October. “I barely made the cut,” he said, neglecting to mention that he shot a 61 on the final day for a one-shot victory. He continued, “That was a big wake-up call for me, realizing I could win on the PGA Tour without my A game.” He also referenced the experience of playing in the final group on the final day of the Masters, again neglecting to mention his final score. A strong finish on Monday would move Kaufman into the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings; he was 34th heading into the Deutsche Bank. He missed the cut last weekend at the Barclays. But while he did not play particularly well at Bethpage Black, he did leave a mark in the form of a golf bag. His plan was to get his fellow pros to sign the bag and then auction it off, with the proceeds going to flood victims in Louisiana. Then his grandfather, a former golf coach at Alabama-Birmingham, received a phone call from a friend who wanted to make a $50,000 donation to Kaufman’s flood-relief efforts. “I was like, ‘Do you want the golf bag in return and just kind of skip the whole eBay process?’” Kaufman said. That man got the golf bag.",

    "source": "Single Gene Shapes Behavior of Ant Castes <eos> Researchers studying the social behavior of ants have found that a single gene underlies both the aggressive behavior of the ant colony’s soldiers and the food gathering behavior of its foraging caste. The gene is active in soldier ants, particularly in five neurons in the front of their brain, where it generates large amounts of its product, a protein known as PKG. The exact amount of the protein in the ants’ brains is critical to their behavior. Low levels of PKG predispose both castes of ant to foraging; high levels make the soldiers fight and the foraging caste less interested in food gathering, Christophe Lucas and Marla B. Sokolowski report in the current issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The soldier and foraging castes in the species of ant under study, known as Pheidole pallidula, have their career choices settled in infancy when they start to be fed different diets. The soldiers develop large heads and jaws, and go on to guard the colony and kill invaders. The foragers, who remain small, specialize in looking for food and bringing back prey to the nest. These specialties are quite flexible, however, because the foragers can recruit the soldiers to food gathering duties when they need extra help. When presented with a live meal worm, within a few minutes the foraging ants can induce the soldiers to help them cut the worm up and take it home. On measuring the levels of the PKG protein in the brains of the soldiers that had helped with food gathering, the researchers found it was much lower than when the soldiers were on guard duty. And the PKG levels shot up in both castes when they were confronted with alien ants from a different colony. Are the different levels of PKG a cause or effect of the ants’ changed behavior? They seem to be a cause. It so happens there is a drug that raises PKG levels. When given a dose of the drug, both castes of ant became less interested in foraging, as tested in the meal worm experiment, and the soldiers became more aggressive in response to intruders. The classical approach to studying how the brain works is to stick electrodes into individual neurons and record their signaling behavior. The analysis of genes and genetic networks seems to be developing as an alternative approach. The PKG gene is of particular interest because it is found throughout the animal kingdom, in fruit flies, worms, ants and people. More than a decade ago, Dr. Sokolowski found that fruit flies have two versions of the PKG gene that endow their larvae with different food gathering behavior. Those with one version rove about in search of new sources of food. Those with the other version are less adventurous. The new study is important because it shows how ants have developed a new use for the PKG gene, that of shaping the characteristic behavior of their different castes, said Gene Robinson, an expert on insect behavior at the University of Illinois. In fruit flies, a DNA difference in the gene changes behavior, but in ants it is a difference in the gene’s activity that makes the soldier caste fight and the foraging caste forage. Dr. Sokolowski said she was studying the PKG gene in people who have seasonal affective disorder , a condition in which they put on too much weight in the winter and take it off in the summer, with swings of up to 50 pounds. The disorder seems to be correlated with genetic variations in the PKG gene. Could the drugs used to manipulate PKG levels in ants prove useful in controlling obesity in people? Dr. Sokolowski said that might be possible if the drugs could be delivered just to the brain. PKG plays important roles elsewhere in the body, including the heart, so the drugs would be perilous in the general circulation. Dr. Robinson said the PKG gene appeared to be one of great versatility, relied on by evolution for tasks relating to feeding behavior in many species. In this respect it seems similar to the FOXP2 gene, which has turned up in communication behaviors from bats to people, or to the PAX6 gene, which has been involved in all of evolution’s many approaches to vision.",

    "source": "A Retreat From Weather Disasters <eos> After Hurricane Sandy roared across the Northeastern United States, many homeowners on Long Island — even those who escaped the most damage — often lost their property insurance . The same thing happened in coastal Virginia after Hurricane Katrina , which hit hundreds of miles away along the Gulf Coast. Today, from Florida to Delaware , property insurance near the water is becoming harder and harder to find. “I’m worried because insurers only stay in markets until they deem them not profitable,” said Mike Kreidler, the Washington State insurance commissioner. “We want these insurers to stay fully in the market.” This is not exclusively an American phenomenon. As the damages wrought by increasingly disruptive weather patterns have climbed around the world, the insurance industry seems to have quietly engaged in what looks a lot like a retreat. A report to be released Wednesday by Ceres , the sustainability advocacy group, makes the point forcefully. “Over the past 30 years annual losses from natural catastrophes have continued to increase while the insured portion has declined,” it concluded. Last year, less than a third of the $116 billion in worldwide losses from weather-related disasters were covered by insurance, according to data from the reinsurer Swiss Re. In 2005, the year Katrina struck, insurance picked up 45 percent of the bill. This gradual, low-key withdrawal reveals an alarming weakness. Even as the risks of climactic upheaval increase with a warming atmosphere, the industry created to provide for civilization’s first line of defense against disasters is turning tail. “In the long run,” the Ceres report added, “these coverage retreats transfer growing risks to public institutions and local populations, and reduce the resiliency of communities, which are less able to finance postdisaster recoveries.” In the first report of this kind, Ceres ranked the preparedness for climate change of the 330 largest insurance firms doing business in the United States, representing about 87 percent of the property and casualty, health and life insurance market. Using insurers’ responses last year to a climate risk survey developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Ceres ranked their performance on half a dozen indicators, from how climate change figured in risk-management systems and governance to whether they took into account climate-related risks to their investment portfolios. The good news is that a few big firms are truly paying attention. The bad news is that there are only nine — including just two American companies, Prudential and the Hartford, and several big reinsurers like Swiss Re and Munich Re. By contrast, 276 insurers earned “beginning” or “minimal” ratings. “Eighty-five percent of the industry is just starting to develop a plan or really not doing much at all,” said Cynthia McHale, director of the Ceres insurance program, who led the research effort. For some insurers, apparently, the risks of climate change still seem too distant and abstract. Life insurers must hold very long-term investments in assets like real estate that could lose value sharply because of climate change. Still, Ceres noted, most of them “do not believe they face significant risks.” Similarly, with the exception of Kaiser Permanente, health insurers are ignoring the impact that climate change could have on disease patterns and human health. Property and casualty insurers have a clearer picture of the huge potential costs they face. CoreLogic, which provides analysis on the property market, calculates that more than 6.5 million homes in the United States are at risk of storm surge damage . Their reconstruction value is $1.5 trillion, or about one-tenth of the annual output of the entire American economy. What is holding back the insurers on the front line of climate change, it seems, is an entirely different reason: the threat of legal liability. Lawsuits over climate are popping up. In 2011, the power company AES tried to draw on its contracts with Steadfast Insurance when an Inupiat Eskimo village in Alaska sued it, along with a bunch of coal-burning utilities, a coal producer and some energy companies, because sea ice that formerly protected the village from winter storms was melting. The state Supreme Court of Virginia ultimately agreed that Steadfast could deny coverage . Other suits for damages have also failed. But that won’t hold liability at bay forever. Munich Re, for instance, says it believes policies covering corporate officers and directors may have to pay for damages stemming from their failure to consider the consequences of climate change in their professional activities. “Lawsuits are an inevitable part of the American system for determining whether and how to compensate for damages,” the Ceres report noted. “The larger the alleged injuries from climate change, the greater the recovery efforts will be.” They could quickly add up. In a 2011 report, the United Nations Environmental Program’s Finance Initiative concluded that the world’s 3,000 top public companies were causing about $1.5 trillion a year of environmental damage because of greenhouse gas emissions. Fears of liability risks seem to be freezing insurers like deer in the headlights. Insurance companies that were already wary of the political risk of wading into the climate change debate have been further chilled by the potential legal liability. If they start writing policies specifically excluding liabilities related to climate change, could that be interpreted as saying that previous policies did cover them? What if they don’t mention it at all? “Discussions of liability disclosure occur more openly outside of the U.S.,” said Lindene E. Patton, the former chief climate product officer at Zurich Re, who was a co-author of the American Bar Association’s “Climate Change and Insurance” report two years ago. “In the U. S. anything you say can be interpreted in future litigation.” Indeed, “there’s a huge reluctance to even use the word climate change,” Ms. McHale, the Ceres expert, said. “Insurance companies did not underwrite or price for climate liability. So their lawyers advise them not to talk about it and not to use the word.” The quandary for insurance companies, of course, is that they can’t give up writing insurance policies without eventually putting themselves out of business. And walking away from markets as they become too risky to insure is not sustainable. For one thing, as insurers on Long Island discovered after Hurricane Sandy, politicians will try to stop them. Insurers won’t be able to stay in markets where they can’t align premiums with rising risk. Government regulators must acknowledge this fact. Policy makers must also realize that the enormous subsidies for Americans to build in harm’s way are ultimately counterproductive. Insurers could play a constructive role in preparing the world for climate change, prodding governments and consumers to take account of rising climate risks. “If we have the ability to affect the rebuild after a catastrophe we can have an impact,” said Tony Kuczinski, chief executive of Munich Re America. But rather than promoting a better understanding of risk, Ms. McHale notes, American insurers flooded with foreign cash are in a race to take market share from one another . The biggest risk of all is that the insurance industry fails when it is most needed. “At some point, sooner or later, there will be a situation where there are much higher liabilities than anybody anticipated,” Ms. McHale warned. “Some companies will have problems.” So will the rest of us.",

    "source": "Science Answers Why Frozen Ropes Freeze Outfielders <eos> Almost all outfielders have had fleeting moments of panic when balls are hit straight at them. How far away is the ball? How fast is it going? When will it get here? And most important, where should my glove be when it arrives? Why do line drives hit straight at outfielders give them so much trouble? A new study by British psychologists may help explain the problem — although knowing the scientific facts may prove cold comfort to fielders who have watched liners zip three feet past their ear or bounce off the tops of their shoes. These scientists did not have baseball players in mind, or even cricket players, for that matter. They say their findings, published in August in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, may prove useful in designing artificial visual systems for robots to help the blind and for use in industrial applications. But their work applies as much to center fielders as it does to computer engineers. The Yankees’ Johnny Damon said that trying to decide where a liner was going could make an outfielder numb, at least for a second or two. “The other day in Minnesota, I had to freeze with a ball hit right at me,” he said. “I didn’t know where it was going. It’s always a tough play for an outfielder, not just a center fielder, but a left fielder, a right fielder.” The researchers used a computer screen to turn their subjects into virtual outfielders. They showed them the sequential movements of a small target, going either side to side or straight at them, and asked them to decide which moved farther. The observers were one and a half to three times better at guessing the correct answer when the objects were moving laterally. Then they presented their subjects with two targets moving at the same speed — one laterally and one in depth — and asked them to decide which was faster. On average, they said the lateral motion was 1.3 to 2.7 times faster than an object at the identical speed but moving straight at them. Finally, they asked their subjects to estimate the angle at which an object was approaching them. The trajectory of an object moving close to the midline of vision was consistently harder to predict than objects moving at greater angles to the observer. In other words, when the object was moving directly toward them, people were terrible at estimating distance, bad at guessing speed and highly inaccurate at predicting trajectory — a combination all but guaranteed to increase the opposition’s batting average. “Binocular vision is quite good for working out where objects are in space,” said Andrew E. Welchman, the lead author of the study and a lecturer at the University of Birmingham in England. “Because you have two eyes, the brain can take signals from each and compare them over time, averaging them. But when you have an object coming toward you, the differences in the information you get from the left and right side are more subtle,” and this makes the decision on location and speed more difficult. There are techniques outfielders can use, but they are not always able to apply them. “A line drive — sometimes they go down, sometimes they go up,” the Yankees’ Bobby Abreu said. “If you can see the rotation, you can judge it.” And if you cannot see the rotation? Abreu laughed and shook his head. “They’re going to boo you,” he said. He rocked in the chair in front of his locker, then repeated, “They’re going to boo you.” The problem Damon and Abreu face, the scientists say, is a product not only of human biology and the laws of physics, but also of our environment. We live, generally speaking, in a world of slowly moving objects, and things that move fast are, under normal circumstances, rarely moving at us. Our motor responses to moving objects have evolved to deal with this ordinary world, not the world of fast-flying baseballs. Damon said he could go back to the video after a game to slow things down and see what happened to the ball — whether it moved up or down, or sliced away. But by then, it is too late. “Sometimes, you’re watching, watching,” Damon said. “And then — whoops! And that’s the worst feeling in the world.”",

    "source": "Purchase Performing Center Chief Hopes to Give the People What They Want <eos> YOU can learn a lot from watching an audience, said Wiley Hausam, the new executive director of the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College, in Purchase. Mr. Hausam has done lots of watching and listening since assuming his post in July. And what he has learned, he said, is that the center is “a little behind the times.” “In the old days, someone said, ‘This is what you’ll see,’ ” he explained. “The people accepted that, and came and sat quietly. The world is different now, it’s interactive.” So he is reaching out to the center’s main constituencies — the residents of Westchester, and of Fairfield County in Connecticut — to find out what kind of entertainment people want at the theater complex. which is among the area’s largest. He has even gone so far as to make his e-mail address — wiley.hausam@purchase.edu — public. “I’d love a flood of e-mails,” he said. Mr. Hausam, a native of Missouri, has had ample opportunity to observe audiences over the last 30 years. In his previous capacity as the founding executive director of the Jack H. Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University, he oversaw the construction of a new 850-seat theater and shaped its philosophy. He was the artistic director of the Songbook Series at Joe’s Pub, part of the Public Theater in Manhattan, and, earlier, served as an associate producer at the theater and its New York Shakespeare Festival. He has worked at the Houston Grand Opera and the Lyric Opera of Chicago, as well as with the director and producer Harold Prince at the New Lyric Festival in Northampton, Mass., a summer festival Mr. Hausam founded that was devoted to the development of American musical theater. He has also worked as a theater, music, television, film and literary agent. What audiences need more than anything today, he said, is a feeling of connection. “I really believe that the live performance experience in the way we live now is a social glue that’s much more important than an evening’s entertainment,” Mr. Hausam said. “People are in cars alone, or on their computers or cellphones. The time you spend with people in a room is important now.” He said he learned along the way that “if you don’t have three shows going on at once” in a space like the Purchase center, with its four theaters, then “you don’t have enough energy to keep it alive.” At Purchase, he said, he envisions simultaneous events like traditional classical music, indie rock and either experimental theater or contemporary dance. When the three audiences mingle in the lobby at intermission, he said, “it will be like the town center.” The catch is the money needed to sustain such a creative maelstrom, he said, estimating that the center would have to raise $1 million of its $3 million presentation budget each year. The other $2 million would come from box office income, other earned income and state and college support, he said. (The center’s total budget is $5.8 million.) Mr. Hausam’s goal is to broaden the center’s offerings and possibly add a pop star to the lineup. “We need to engage the community,” he said. He is sure to be present on Saturday, when the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves opens the center’s 31st season. Mr. Hausam, who once aspired to being an opera singer, may even stand on one of the grand stairways flanking the main lobby, much as he did at the Skirball Center, with its “great curving steps.” In that, he would be like his predecessor, Christopher Beach, who ran the Purchase center from 1989 to 2005 and made a point of his visibility. But don’t be surprised, Mr. Hausam said, if he doesn’t have “a big theatrical personality.” “I’m not like that,” he said. “I’m passionate, and a bit quirky.”",

    "source": "First U.S. Gold of ’08 Games Comes in Fencing <eos> BEIJING— Three American fencers swept the women's sabre finals on Saturday, winning the first three medals of the Olympics for the United States and at least temporarily investing this little-known sport, introduced to the Olympics in 2004, with some Errol Flynn-like glamour. Mariel Zagunis, of Beaverton, Ore., defeated her teammate Sada Jacobson, of Dunwoody, Ga., to win the gold. And in the most thrilling bout of the evening, Becca Ward, from Portland, Ore., rallied to edge Russia's Sofia Velikaya for the bronze. Zagunis, the daughter of two Olympic rowers, also won the sabre event in Athens in 2004. This time, she beat Ward, 15-11, in an emotional semifinal match that had each fencer yelling and punching the air after winning a point. Then, her momentum building, she was unstoppable in the final. Lunging and slashing, Zagunis never gave Jacobson a chance and defeated her, 15-8. Ward, 18, the youngest of the three fencers, left the hall in tears after her loss to Zagunis. Against Velikaye in the bronze medal bout, she still looked crestfallen and fell behind by 6-1, parrying and backing up, before starting to attack. After scoring 4 quick points in a row, she began to draw even, and near the end of the bout, she led, 14-13, before getting caught on a quick lunge by Velikaye. On the final, tie-breaking point, she said she was so nervous that she made up her mind to attack. Velikaye attacked, too, and their sabres flashed so quickly that before awarding the winning point to Ward, the referee had to consult a video monitor. Fencing is a small world. Zagunis and Ward belong to the same fencing club in Oregon. Jacobson took up the sport following the example of her father, who was a member of the 1974 United States national fencing team. That the women's sabre event was so new was an advantage, Zagunis said, because it meant that the team was able to get international experience right away. The team has been together long enough that the three women have not only become very good friends but have fenced together countless times and know one another's moves. \"When we're on the strip, it's all business,\" Jacobson said, referring to the competition area. \"When we're off the strip, we're friends again.\" Talking about how it felt to compete against her teammates, Jacobson said: \"They know you, and you know them, so there's no real advantage there. It's more an emotional thing.\" When you fence against someone you don't know, she added, \"it's a lot easier to want to — well, not destroy that person, but to want the victory a lot. But you're more aware when you're fencing against you're friend — you know how devastating it is to lose. It doesn't make the fencing more complicated, but it makes the emotional aspect more difficult.\"",

For $860, a student could get one after a three-day course of study that included “baton takedown and control” classes, “speed cuffing” lessons and the proper use of pepper spray. Unfortunately for the men who ran the school, which was not affiliated with the government, they also showed the great seal of the United States, complete with a bald eagle clutching an olive branch and a bundled bunch of arrows. This, as it happens, is against the law, and the two men, Robert Neves and Ralph Rios, were arrested Tuesday morning and charged with a federal crime. The crime in question was a violation of Title 18, Section 713, of the United States Code: a conspiracy, court papers said, to “display a printed and other likeness of the great seal of the United States” for “the purpose of conveying, and in a manner reasonably calculated to convey, a false impression of sponsorship or approval by the government.” The eagle on the badge had a banner in its mouth, reading “E Pluribus Unum.” The government said the two defendants put holographic decals on the badges to make them look “more legit.” Mr. Neves, 49, a Staten Island resident and a former city detective, appeared on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, and was released on $55,000 bail. The police said he was fired from the Police Department in 1995 for improperly obtaining computer records. His lawyer, Steven Witzel, declined to comment on the case. Mr. Rios, 49, was arrested on Tuesday in Miami and appeared in Federal District Court there, prosecutors said. The case is being prosecuted in New York, and Mr. Rios will be brought to Manhattan to face the charges, officials said. According to a federal complaint unsealed on Tuesday, Mr. Neves took a course at the Passaic, N.J., branch of Recovery Bureau in 2004 after which Mr. Rios asked him to become an instructor and to open up a second school in Brooklyn. Of the thousands of students who passed through locations in Brooklyn, New Jersey and Washington Heights, 78 who received credentials were convicted felons, prosecutors said. In fact, court papers said, some of the students used their phony badges to avoid parking tickets and avoid other “law enforcement actions” while others used them to improperly gain access to secure government buildings. In at least one case, the papers said, a student used a badge to pose as an officer while committing a robbery. “The industry has been tightening up over the years, but unfortunately there are a lot of mavericks out there impersonating law enforcement officers,” said Bill Kreins, a spokesman for the Professional Bail Agents of the United States, an industry trade group. “It should be dealt with accordingly.” Mr. Kreins said there were 14,000 licensed bail agents in the country who are legally bound to identify themselves clearly as “bail enforcement people” on their badges and their clothing. While chasing fugitives, a bail agent will sometimes transfer powers of arrest to actual bounty hunters; Mr. Kreins said there “are probably not more than 150 or 200 properly licensed” bounty hunters nationwide. Recovery Bureau’s badges were obtained, the government said, from Smith & Warren, which has manufactured badges and other public safety insignia in White Plains since 1925. A spokeswoman for the company said on Tuesday that she had never heard of Recovery Bureau and had no comment on the case.",

The signal for WNYW Channel 5 could go dark in Cablevision homes at midnight Friday if the cable operator and News Corporation, which owns Fox Broadcasting, cannot resolve a financial dispute over the cost of carrying Fox stations like Channel 5 and WWOR Channel 9. The talks also include the Fox Business Network, Fox Deportes and Nat Geo Wild, all owned by News Corp. If the impasse continues beyond Saturday, the Giants’ game against the Detroit Lions Sunday at 1 p.m. and Game 2 of the N.L.C.S. at 8:19 p.m. will not be see in Cablevision’s territories (Long Island and parts of Connecticut, the Bronx, Brooklyn, New Jersey and Westchester, Rockland and Dutchess Counties.). The two sides were negotiating as of late Friday afternoon. “It is outrageous and wrong for Fox to use baseball and football games to hold viewers hostage and extract tens of millions of dollars from Cablevision customers,” the Cablevision spokesman Charles Schueler said in a statement. “Cablevision has agreed to binding arbitration and Fox should do the same.” Talks in such squabbles usually go to the deadline or are extended as stations seek to increase their fees from cable operators for programming that they believe is critical. Major sports and entertainment events often become the focus of what might be lost if the stations cannot be seen. “It’s unfortunate that a sports fan might have to miss a single pitch or snap,” Lou D’Ermilio, a spokesman for Fox Sports, said in a statement, “but our position in these negotiations is entirely reasonable — we are simply asking for fair compensation for the value that Fox5 and My9 programming offers and the same negotiated rate that other cable operators have agreed to already.”",

    "source": "Unemployment Claims Rose Last Week <eos> WASHINGTON (AP) — The Labor Department said on Thursday that new jobless claims rose unexpectedly last week. And the number of people continuing to receive unemployment was higher than expected. The figures indicate that jobs remain scarce even as the economy shows some signs of recovering from the longest recession since World War II. A revised reading on gross domestic product , the broadest measure of the nation’s output, said the economy posted a 5.5 percent annualized decline from January through March. That was slightly better than the 5.7 percent estimate made a month ago. Economists generally think the economy is shrinking at a slower rate, about 2 percent, in the current quarter. During the quarter, businesses held larger stockpiles of goods than in previous quarters, and imports declined more sharply than previously estimated. Initial claims for jobless benefits rose last week by 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 627,000. Economists had expected a drop to 600,000. Several states reported more claims than expected from teachers, cafeteria workers and other school employees, a Labor Department analyst said. The number of people who are continuing to receive unemployment insurance rose by 29,000, to 6.74 million, slightly above analysts’ estimates of 6.7 million. The four-week average of claims, which smoothes out fluctuations, was largely unchanged, at 616,750. Most economists still expect the number of initial unemployment insurance claims, which reflects the level of layoffs, to decline slowly in coming months as the recession bottoms out. “We still firmly believe that the underlying trends in claims is downwards, but it is slow and uneven,” Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, wrote in a client note. The number of people continuing to receive unemployment aid remains below the peak of 6.8 million reached on May 30. That means job losses are most likely slowing, economists said. Meanwhile, the rebound in consumer spending in the first quarter was slightly less vigorous than previously reported. Consumers increased their spending at a 1.4 percent rate, down from a 1.5 percent growth rate estimated last month. Still, that was the strongest showing in nearly two years and a huge improvement from the fourth quarter, when skittish consumers cut spending by the most in nearly three decades.",

    "source": "Winds as High as 60 M.P.H. Halt Play at Women’s British Open <eos> HOYLAKE, England — On the 10th tee, her first hole of the day, Cristie Kerr stuck her teed ball in the ground. Never mind the ball staying put; Kerr said she was nearly swept off her feet by the strong winds that whipped through Royal Liverpool Golf Club on Friday, turning the second round of the year’s final major into the Women’s Brutish Open. Six groups were sent off the 1st and 10th tees in weather conditions that were bad even by British Open standards. Some players said the conditions were the worst they had ever seen on a course. Nobody finished, and there was heated debate about whether any golfer should have started. “I thought it was iffy when I went out,” said Michelle Wie , who was playing in the group behind Kerr’s. “I put a couple balls on the practice green right before I went out, and the balls were not stopping, and mind you, that’s a flat surface.” She added: “I would say windy conditions would be 15 miles an hour; 20 is really bad. The gusts were going up to 35 this morning. That’s really, really, really, really windy.” When the winds reached 60 miles per hour, with the first players through four holes, play was suspended. It was called for the day in the early afternoon. The players who began their second round in the gale will resume play early Saturday morning with a fresh start after all of Friday’s scores were voided. That news was perhaps most welcome to the English player Felicity Johnson, who posted a nine on the par-4 opening hole. Haeji Kang and So Yeon Ryu were the first-round leaders, at two-under-par 70. Susan Simpson, the Ladies Golf Union tournament director, said, “The competitors began their round in extremely adverse weather conditions, and conditions subsequently worsened despite our belief that they would remain stable.” After reviewing its options, the Championship Committee decided the second round would be completed Saturday, with the cut reduced from 65 players to the top 50 players and ties. The third and fourth rounds will be played Sunday, with a two-tee start and no redraw after the third round. The decision to try for an on-time finish was motivated by the forecast for Monday, which calls for conditions similar to Friday’s. “You can’t play under unplayable conditions, and that’s what we did for three holes,” said Kerr, who was in the first group off the 10th tee with Suzann Pettersen and Erina Hara. Kerr said on the 12th hole, which is exposed to the Dee Estuary, “My ball almost didn’t stay on the tee, and I got knocked over hitting my tee shot.” Kerr said Pettersen had a 1-foot putt that turned into an 8-footer because the ball moved as soon as she placed it in front of her marker. Wie said that by the time she and her playing partners, Carly Booth and Beatriz Recari, got to the 12th fairway, “we were waiting for quite a while because none of the balls on the greens were stopping once they were marking it.” She continued, “I think the rules official was called over about four or five times, and finally the sixth time Beatriz decided to go up to the green to really make our point that really it’s unplayable right now.” Tournament officials said no records were kept on scores being voided, but it is known to have happened at least three times: in the third round of the 1988 British Open at nearby Royal Lytham & St. Annes, won by Seve Ballesteros in a Monday finish, and in two events on the L.P.G.A. Tour. Local officials recalled a men’s event at Royal Liverpool being suspended because of high winds in the 1980s. That competition was also held in September, when daylight decreases and the winds typically pick up. This year’s Women’s British Open was pushed back from its usual July date so it would not coincide with the London Olympics. The players waited out the suspension in the players’ lounge, a tented area that grew more crowded and noisy as the day progressed. “We were just telling stories back and forth about how ridiculous the conditions were,” Wie said, adding, “I was thinking today, under these conditions, breaking 90 would be a good thing.” Karen Stupples, the 2004 Women’s British Open champion from England, was in the first group off No. 1 and started double bogey, birdie, double bogey, par before play was suspended. She said she was reduced to hitting putts while the ball was oscillating on the green, an experience she had never encountered in all of her years playing links golf. “It was an ongoing battle against the golf ball and the wind,” Stupples, 39, said, “and I’m afraid when the wind is like this, it just won.”",

    "source": "Against Blue Jays, Derek Jeter and Yankees Show Signs of Life <eos> The flashbulbs portion of the season has finally arrived. That was one of the first surefire signs of Derek Jeter’s final regular-season homestand at Yankee Stadium: the winking lights from digital cameras greeting his every at-bat. There were many more signs, and more to come still. The farewell tour has turned its final corner. But with the Yankees still ostensibly in the hunt for the postseason — at least according to the standings — Jeter was hardly in a mood for remembrance. He jogged right past the No. 2 logo painted along each baseline, and remained in the dugout as fans cheered his name after a sixth-inning home run, forgoing a curtain call so that Brian McCann could focus on his at-bat. This is crunch time. And the Yankees gladly accepted a game-ending error by Toronto Blue Jays first baseman Adam Lind in the ninth inning, allowing pinch-runner Antoan Richardson to jog in from third base with the winning run in a 3-2 victory. It was not the prettiest of finishes, but it technically counted as Chase Headley’s third game-ending, run-scoring at-bat since he joined the Yankees in July. Richardson, who pinch-ran for Chris Young after Young led off the ninth with a single, stole second to get into scoring position and reached third on Brett Gardner’s sacrifice bunt. “Tonight obviously it was about the guys before me,” Headley said. “I put the ball in play and it worked out.” Three innings earlier, Jeter jolted the crowd by lashing a 3-1 fastball from the knuckleballer R. A. Dickey into the stands in left field, giving the Yankees a 2-0 lead. It was Jeter’s first home run since Aug. 1, a drought of 158 at-bats. It was also his first home run at the Stadium this season. “Thank you,” he said playfully when informed of this after the game. “I’m happy we won the game. I can’t worry about what I’ve done up until this point. I’m just trying to have one last good homestand here and I’m going to try to play as hard as I can.” The Yankees are in desperation mode, five games behind the Athletics for the second wild-card spot. But Kansas City, which was off Thursday, has lost six of its last 10 games. Oakland, which is a half-game behind the Royals, has been even worse, losing eight of 11. Image Chase Headley scoring in the fifth inning. Credit Barton Silverman/The New York Times Other teams in the race, like Seattle and Cleveland, have not exactly come in hot pursuit. That at least provides the Yankees, after a 2-5 trip, some incentive to capitalize on the emotional lift of Jeter’s farewell. The game remained scoreless until the fifth. Dickey issued a two-out walk to Headley, and Stephen Drew jumped on the first pitch, sending it into the right-field corner to score Headley. Then came Jeter in the sixth. Dickey fell behind in the count, 3-0, and then left an 82-mile-per-hour fastball up and in. Jeter whipped it around into the left-field stands. “He has that ability,” Manager Joe Girardi said. “He’s a guy you want up with the game on the line in big situations.” It represented the game’s hardest hit until the Blue Jays slugger Jose Bautista’s two-run homer in the eighth inning off reliever Shawn Kelley tied the score. Jeter is well aware that this is his last hurrah, at least in the regular season. When he showed up at his locker early Thursday afternoon, a crowd of reporters had already formed. “I just talked to you last night,” he said. “Nothing’s changed.” Jeter’s No. 2 painted along each baseline matched the logos all the Yankee players are wearing on their caps. Earlier in the day, Gatorade released a commercial celebrating Jeter’s final weeks in the Bronx, to the tune of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way.” “I’ve always liked the song,” Jeter said before the game. “I thought it fit for what I’m going through. I’m happy we used it.” Asked if he had had any chance to process this being the end of his 20-year career, Jeter said it was hard because “it’s all anyone’s been talking about.” “I want to just try to enjoy it,” he added. “I want to play games and I’m looking forward to going out and playing. INSIDE PITCH Masahiro Tanaka threw 32 pitches in a bullpen session Thursday afternoon and reported feeling fine. He is scheduled to make his first start Sunday since sustaining a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament July 8. ...Carlos Beltran returned to the team after Wednesday’s announcement that his wife, Jessica, had miscarried.

    "source": "Matt Cain’s Perfection Matched by His Dominance <eos> There is no such thing as a typical no-hitter, but this year it seems pitchers are going to extreme lengths for individuality. Johan Santana broke the Mets’ 8,019-game streak of not having a no-hitter; six Seattle Mariners pitchers combined to throw one; and Philip Humber of the Chicago White Sox tossed a perfect game just a few years removed from being considered a major league bust. Measured against that group, Jered Weaver’s no-hitter in May seems almost boring. But on Wednesday night, Matt Cain of the San Francisco Giants trumped them all, throwing not just a perfect game but also perhaps the second-greatest perfect game in baseball history. Cain’s 10-0 masterpiece against the Houston Astros was the first perfect game and 14th no-hitter in the Giants’ 130-season history, which includes the efforts of the Hall of Fame pitchers Christy Mathewson, Carl Hubbell and Juan Marichal. Cain’s performance was nothing short of stunning. His 14 strikeouts tied the perfect-game record set by Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Chicago Cubs on Sept. 9, 1965, and he allowed just seven balls out of the infield. Contrast Cain’s performance to that of Humber, who threw his perfect game on April 21 against the Seattle Mariners. Humber struck out nine and had 13 flyouts. It is splitting hairs, but Cain’s combination of 20 outs through strikeouts or ground balls was superior in the sense that he controlled more of the game’s outcome. The statistics guru Bill James developed a statistic called game score to evaluate pitching performances. It awards points for outs, innings and strikeouts and takes points away for hits, walks, runs and earned runs. By that measure, Cain’s performance tied Koufax for the most dominant of the 20 modern-era perfect games with a score of 101. Making game score controversial in the evaluation of no-hitters and perfect games is that it is a measure of dominance, not perfection. For instance, Nolan Ryan also scored 101 in one of the no-hitters he pitched, but he also allowed two walks, balanced out by his 16 strikeouts. The highest game score came in a game that was neither a no-hitter nor a perfect game. Cain, Koufax and Ryan all trail Kerry Wood, who, as a Cub, struck out 20 Astros, walked none and allowed one hit on May 6, 1998, setting a nine-inning record with a game score of 105. In Wood’s masterpiece, the lone hit was a ground-ball single by Ricky Gutierrez. To trade one ground-ball single for six strikeouts gives Wood the edge in dominance, even if the performance lacked the romance of a pitcher remaining perfect. The only knock against Cain’s performance was the quality of his competition. While the 1965 Cubs were not a particularly good team, Koufax had to contend with Billy Williams, Ernie Banks and Ron Santo, a much more intimidating threesome than the light-hitting 2012 Astros can offer. Cain needed 125 pitches to complete the game, while Koufax needed just 107. It is fitting that the competition for greatest perfect game would come down to a Dodger and a Giant; the teams have had a fierce rivalry since the 19th century, and by the narrowest margins Koufax does appear to have the edge on Cain. If Cain and Koufax threw the most dominant perfect games, the least imposing in terms of game score was pitched by Addie Joss of the Cleveland Naps against the White Sox in 1908. In that game, Joss struck out just three batters, giving him a game score of 90. Individual game data is searchable on Baseball-Reference.com only since 1918, but in that time frame 639 starters have had a game score higher than Joss did in a nine-inning game. However, what Joss lacked in dominance in his perfect game he made up for in economy, needing just 74 pitches to get through nine innings. The oddest of the perfect games was one of the two thrown before the modern era began in 1901. Lee Richmond of the Worcester Ruby Legs was perfect on June 12, 1880, but benefited greatly from the rules of the era. Richmond was throwing underhand from 50 feet away, and three times in the game an out was recorded on a foul ball that had bounced. The rule on bouncing foul balls being counted as outs was not changed until 1883. Finally, on the same night that Cain was attaining perfection, R. A. Dickey of the Mets managed a game score of 95 by striking out 12 in a one-hitter against the Tampa Bay Rays. The scoring decision on the base hit is being appealed by the Mets, but it is not likely to be reversed. For now, anyway, Dickey has the 79th-most dominant nine-inning performance of the last 94 years.",

His order, which followed emergency declarations by the city and county governments, came on the day federal officials announced an investigation of the contamination. Mr. Snyder’s administration has been criticized as slow to respond to residents’ concerns about their water. Last week, he apologized and announced staffing changes at the state agency that oversees environmental quality. Flint, which had long received water from Lake Huron provided by Detroit’s water utility, began drawing its water from the Flint River in 2014 in an effort to save money while a new pipeline was built. Residents soon complained about rashes and strange odors from the river water, but city and state officials mostly insisted that it was safe to drink . Last year, elevated levels of lead were found in children’s blood, and in October, Flint switched back to Detroit’s water system.

His plans, presented in a recent speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , represent a broad overhaul of current policy, one that reverses a quarter-century trend, under Republican and Democratic presidents, of concentrating responsibility for school quality at the federal level. “I will expand parental choice in an unprecedented way,” Mr. Romney said, adding that families’ freedom to vote with their feet “will hold schools responsible for results.” His proposals are the clearest sign yet that Republicans have executed an about-face from the education policies of President George W. Bush , whose signature domestic initiative, the No Child Left Behind law of 2002, required uniform state testing and imposed penalties on schools that failed to progress. Now Mr. Romney is taking his party back to its ideological roots by emphasizing a lesser role for Washington, replacing top-down mandates with a belief in market mechanisms. It is a change driven in part by Tea Party disdain of the federal government. In the Republican presidential nominating fight, candidates competed in calling to shut the Education Department . Mr. Romney, who never went that far, also seems hemmed in politically by the fact that President Obama promotes many solutions that were once Republican talking points, including charter schools and teacher evaluations tied to test scores. “There’s not much left for Republicans to be distinctive about,” said Chester E. Finn, Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education policy group. “The one line the Obama folks have refused to cross is the voucher line” — that is, allowing students to use taxpayer money to attend any certified school, even a private school. Specifically, Mr. Romney proposed to change federal payments made to schools with large numbers of poor and disabled students into an individual entitlement. Students would take a share of the $25 billion in two federal programs to the school of their choice. He would also extract the federal government from intervening to turn around the lowest performing schools, which has been a chief focus of the Obama administration. Instead, to drive improvement, Mr. Romney would have schools compete for students in a more market-based approach to quality. “This is the best motive to reform there will ever be — if you give parents the ability to vote with their feet,” said Tom Luna, Idaho ’s superintendent of schools, who is an adviser to Mr. Romney. But there is limited evidence in the real world of schools improving much as they compete for students, according to education experts. One notable skeptic is Margaret Spellings , a former education secretary under Mr. Bush, who this year was an informal adviser to Mr. Romney. She said she withdrew once the candidate rejected strong federal accountability measures. “I have long supported and defended and believe in a muscular federal role on school accountability,” Ms. Spellings said. “Vouchers and choice as the drivers of accountability — obviously that’s untried and untested.” Although offering economically disadvantaged children an escape from a failing neighborhood school may be a matter of fairness, Mr. Romney’s argument is broader: choice, he said, will promote competition for students and, like a rising tide, lift all schools. One recent study of a Florida program offering private school vouchers to low-income families found that test scores at public schools, faced with competition, went up. But critics say that the improvements are small, and that the idea is shaped by ideology more than evidence. “Romney is on poor empirical ground in making a claim based on competitive effects,” said Christopher Lubienski, an education professor at the University of Illinois . James Kvaal, the policy director of the Obama campaign, accused Mr. Romney of seeking to “stop the clock on decades of reform by no longer insisting action be taken when a school has been struggling for years.” Advocates for vouchers say they will have a larger impact if they become more widespread. One of Mr. Romney’s ideas for increasing students’ choices seems to contradict an anti-Washington emphasis: giving poor students the freedom to choose a public school outside their district. District boundaries have long been sacrosanct. They prevent urban students, for example, from enrolling in suburban schools that typically have higher-income families and sometimes more lavish budgets. Calls for open enrollment across districts are usually the province of liberal groups, said Kevin Carey, director of education policy at the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan research group. “For the federal government to require districts to open up their boundaries would be a level of federal intrusion into the affairs of states and local districts far beyond anything” in current law, Mr. Carey said. Mr. Romney’s policy seems closely inspired by a pro-voucher report issued in February by the conservative Hoover Institution. Five of eight members of a task force that produced the report are among the 19 education advisers the Romney campaign named last month. Once thought to be moribund, the voucher movement was revived by gains Republicans made in the 2010 midterm elections. Fourteen states since then have introduced or expanded private school vouchers, according to the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice. The money for the vouchers would come from two federal programs that Mr. Romney would overhaul that target students deemed in need of extra support: Title 1, for economically disadvantaged students; and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Currently the money from both programs, the largest K-12 initiatives in the Education Department, is awarded to states and districts based on federal formulas. Grover J. Whitehurst, a Romney adviser, said that remaking the programs into individual payments that follow the student — he used the metaphor of a student’s backpack — could attract other streams of education dollars. “If you connected state funding with federal funding, then you’re talking about a backpack with enough money in it to really empower choice,” said Mr. Whitehurst, director of education policy at the Brookings Institution . “The idea would be the federal Title 1 funds would allow states that want to move in this direction to do so, and if they did so, all of a sudden it’s a game changer.”",

    "source": "A Toast to Evolvability and Its Promise of Surprise <eos> Late last month, the day after my birthday, I was feeling punch drunk on my favorite glogg of sullenness, self-pity and panic. My life was passing by at relativistic speed, not one of my rotten siblings had called to wish me a happy birthday, my husband hadn’t bothered to arrange so much as a waiter-serenaded slice of cake at the restaurant the night before, and did he really think that his gift to me of an “amazing squirrel-proof bird feeder” would excite anybody but the squirrels? My post-birthday gloom was so rich, so satisfyingly glutinous, that I forgot to be suspicious, and when we headed over to a neighbor’s house later that evening, I opened the door like a cartoon buffoon onto a huge throng of friends and relations, gathered from across the nation and athwart my entire curriculum vitae, bellowing out in fractured synchrony that magic word “Surprise!” I gasped. I squealed. I felt like I’d died and gone to a TV game show. I’d gotten the surprise party of my admittedly oft-expressed fantasies, and I was thrilled, moved and profoundly grateful. Yet as I stumbled in a stupor from one friend who’d spent hundreds of dollars on airfare just to be there to the next, I couldn’t help wondering why I’d wanted such a shock to my system in the first place. I’m not much of a thrill seeker or adventurer. I like libraries, museums and speed bumps. I am, nevertheless, a multicellular organism of reasonably complex structure, and we complex bioforms can’t help but appreciate novelty. We are the fruits of it. If not for evolutionary novelty — that is, the periodic and often radical overhauling of an existing cell type, body plan, limb shape or brain design into something new and useful, or at least entertaining — we might still be so many daubs of blue-green algae decorating an Australian rock. And while I mean no offense to algae and recognize that my ancestors looked very much like them, an algal colony has yet to throw me a surprise party or make a passable stab at saying “G’day.” A tip of the paper-cone hat, then, to biological novelty. Under its tutelage, early groups of cells made the leap from the sleepy expulsion of oxygen as waste to the aerobic consumption of oxygen to grow at a hastier pace; and groups of single cells learned to pool their talents into multicellular collectives of specialized body compartments that could then go out and hunt other multicellular collectives; and fishy fins became amphibious feet and crept onto the beach, and some land-weary feet changed their mind and flippered back to the sea, while still other limb bones lengthened and found skin flaps for flying, and, hey, this airborne business is pretty handy, let’s rearticulate the forelimbs of three separate lineages and take wing as a pterodactyl, a bird, a bat. As scientists see it, these and others of nature’s fancy feats forward are clearly the result of large-scale evolutionary forces, but the precise mechanisms behind any given innovation remain piquantly opaque. For some researchers, the conventional gradualist narrative, in which organisms evolve over time through the steady accretion of many mincing genetic mutations, feels unsatisfying when it comes to understanding true biological novelty. “The standard Darwinian view always sounds like a better theory for making improvements than for making inventions,” said Dr. Marc W. Kirschner, a professor of systems biology at Harvard Medical School. If incremental, additive genetic changes were responsible for all the boggling biodiversity we see around us, he said, how can it be that humans have hardly more genes than a microscopic nematode, and that many of those genes are nearly identical in roundworms and humans besides? In their recently published book, “The Plausibility of Life,” Dr. Kirschner and Dr. John C. Gerhart of the University of California, Berkeley, offer a fresh look at the origins of novelty. They argue that many of the basic components and systems of the body possess the quality of what they call “evolvability” — that is, the components can be altered without wreaking havoc on the parts and systems that connect to them, and can even produce a reasonably functional organ or body part in their modified configuration. For example, if a genetic mutation ends up lengthening a limb bone, said Dr. Kirschner, the other parts that attach to and interact with that bone needn’t also be genetically altered in order to yield a perfectly serviceable limb. The nerves, muscles, blood vessels, ligaments and skin are all inherently plastic and adaptable enough to stretch and accommodate the longer bone during embryogenesis and thus, as a team, develop into a notably, even globally, transformed limb with just a single mutation at its base. And if, with that lengthened leg, the lucky recipient gets a jump on its competitors, well, g’day to you, baby kangaroo. Dr. Kirschner also observes that cells and bodies are extremely modular, and parts can be moved around with ease. A relatively simple molecular switch that in one setting allows a cell to respond to sugar can, in a different context, help guide the maturation of a nerve cell. In each case, the activation of the switch initiates a tumbling cascade of complex events with a very distinctive outcome, yet the switch itself is just your basic on-off protein device. By all appearances, evolution has flipped and shuffled and retrofitted and duct-taped together a comparatively small set of starter parts to build a dazzling variety of botanic and bestial bodies. The combined modularity and bounciness of body parts suggest that life is spring-loaded for change, for outrageous commixtures, the wildest fusion cuisine. And who knows whether our organismic suppleness, our deep evolvability, isn’t related to our mental thirst for the new, and our hope that behind the door lies the best surprise yet?",

(No Sign of the Beer.) <eos> Two pretzels unearthed during a dig on the banks of the Danube in Regensburg could be more than 300 years old but are similar to ones available today, archaeologists said Thursday. Dorothee Ott, spokeswoman for the Bavarian Office for Historical Conservation, said the pretzel fragments went on display this week at the Regensburg Historical Museum. Ms. Ott said the pretzels and other baked goods found were badly burned, which is why they survived over the centuries. Archaeologists say they believe they were discarded from a bakery that was once on the site. Carbon dating places their creation between 1700 and 1800. Taking into account about 15 percent shrinkage, Ms. Ott said, “It’s a normal pretzel, maybe a little smaller than today.”",

    "source": "A Review of Beyti Kebab in Union City <eos> Once the holiday season starts, restaurants in which you can dine well and festively, free of crowds or the necessity of advanced planning, are as rare as a perfect Christmas. May I, therefore, introduce you to Beyti Kebab ? Since my children were in high school (they are now too old to eat anywhere but in Brooklyn), our family has been joining friends for dinner, somewhat irreverently, on Christmas Day at this casual and cheerful bastion of sumptuous Turkish food. Traditional it is not, but given our mix of religions and orientations, neither is our crowd. Our only common bond: We like good food, a lively atmosphere and a celebration that is hassle-free. Beyti Kebab, which originally opened as a butcher shop in the early 1980s, fulfills those requirements. Image Chicken kebab with yogurt. Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times The décor is not enhanced by the acoustic tile ceiling and ho-hum travel posters, but the room is brightly lit and the atmosphere is resonant of similar establishments throughout the Middle East, an odd confluence of crystal chandeliers and shelves displaying stacks of plastic containers (Beyti Kebab has a lively takeout business). The food is similarly basic and authentic. Any review of the menu must start not with appetizers but with the restaurant’s pièce de résistance: any meat entree where the word “yogurtlu” appears in the name. The various “yogurtlu” dishes consist of a meat kebab set in a pool of satiny yogurt in which bits of pita bread are in the process of disintegrating. It is the apotheosis of a soggy sandwich — and it is irresistible. Try it and I predict that nostalgia for holiday baked ham or stuffed turkey will cease. The more highly seasoned beyti kebab, the restaurant’s namesake entree, is best eaten without yogurt, because then you can appreciate the judicious use of garlic, onions and red and green peppers that bring out the rich, gamy flavor of the veal and lamb in the dish. Except for the ones with yogurt, plain kebabs, which dominate the list of entrees and include combinations of chicken, lamb, veal or gyro (a mix of veal and lamb), arrive on a bed of buttery, seasoned rice. The accompanying mealy tomato is best ignored, but the long-green pepper beside it is essential: its juicy texture and fruity flavor lighten the experience of eating all that meat. Image The beyti kebab platter. Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times Another suitable companion for the kebabs is the shepherd salad. Long before chopped salads became fashionable, Beyti Kebab was carving chunks of tomato, cucumber and Spanish onions into jewel-like cubes. Chopping the ingredients allows more of their juices, and therefore their flavors, to mingle. The fresh parsley and lemon juice add so much verve that even without feta cheese, the salad sparkles (with feta, it is $2 extra). Like the owner, Ozcan Arslan, the chef, Turan Dayakli, was born in Turkey. When I asked him in a telephone call after my visits where he learned to make the kind of thick, tangy, tahini-rich hummus that is rare outside of the Middle East, he answered Israel. There, too, he perfected his falafel, which he makes with chick peas and broad beans, and serves with a cool, minty sauce. The Turkish bread that appears instantly at your table is a highlight. Served still warm, the slightly charred strips have the qualities of great pizza dough: crusty on the outside with a soft and airy interior. Slightly sour because of the yeast, the strips are perfect for scooping up the ultrarich hummus or the thick, gooey and unforgettably smoky baba ghanouj. Will the more fussy family members in your party find flaws? Don’t they always? One night when the lamb cubes in every other dish were moist and tender, the chunks in the lamb shish were, in fact, leathery. The chicken, a tad dry, might benefit from less cooking. Fried eggplant, the centerpiece of the appetizer known as patlican tavasi, was overwhelmed by yogurt in this version. Perhaps because we come here during the holiday season, our excursions usually end not only with the strong Turkish coffee, but with a stop at the retail shop at the front of the restaurant. There you can purchase gifts: halvah made with pistachios, plump Middle Eastern dates, and the kind of large, buttery Turkish walnuts used in the restaurant’s best dessert, the sweetened shredded phyllo and walnut pastry known as kadayif. Typically quiet on Christmas and New Year’s, Beyti Kebab is quite different on holidays like Ramadan, after the sun sets and daily fasts are broken. “Then, even my banquet room is full,” Mr. Arslan said.",

    "source": "Egyptian Police Confiscate Newsletter, Arrest Sign Holders and Close Grocery Stores <eos> CAIRO — The Egyptian police over the weekend confiscated a human rights group’s newsletter, arrested two activists for a paper sign criticizing the police and shut down two Cairo grocery store chains that the police said had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Less than a week after the inauguration of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the grab bag of notable police actions over two days was the first indication that his administration intends to continue the broad crackdown on dissent that began after the military takeover he led last summer. The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information said in a statement on Sunday that the police had confiscated all 1,000 copies of its newsletter, Wasla, at its printer the previous night. The statement said that a police officer had accused the organization of inciting “the downfall of the regime.” The officer also charged that the newsletter was affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that backed the ousted president, Mohamed Morsi, and was outlawed after the military takeover. But the Arabic Network is a well-established liberal organization often critical of the Islamists. The newsletter, published occasionally since 2010, compiles commentary from blogs and social media, mainly for older Egyptians who are unaccustomed to using the Internet, the organization said in a statement. “The new regime’s intentions have been demonstrated,” Gamal Eid, the executive director of the organization, said in the statement, calling the raid “an indication of the fate of freedom of the press along with freedom of expression.” Riot police officers were seen Sunday forcibly closing many locations of the two grocery store chains, Zad and Seoudi, which Egyptian state media said were also accused of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. The Zad chain was reportedly founded only a few years ago by Khairat el-Shater , a business mogul and senior Brotherhood leader who is now in jail on various political charges. Seoudi, a high-end market, is owned by a businessman who was arrested, under former President Hosni Mubarak, but later acquitted of charges of belonging to the Brotherhood. The arrests of the two activists occurred at about 6 p.m. on Saturday at a small state-authorized demonstration against sexual harassment that was held in one of Cairo’s wealthiest enclaves. With a few dozen demonstrators far outnumbered by truckloads of riot police officers, the two young activists tried to scrawl a sign that said, “The Police Are Harassers.” Egyptian women often complain of harassment by the police or members of the security forces, and they complain even more often that the police fail to enforce existing legal protections against such abuse. But when the two activists were writing the sign, the police swooped in even before they could raise it, said one of the activists, Nader Osama, 20, a student. “We did not even hold it up or anything,” he said. “They told us that the charge will be offending the Interior Ministry,” he said, but “then they released us at 2 a.m. and told us: ‘You can go. That is it.' ”",

    "source": "As Officers Face Heated Words, Their Tactics Vary <eos> Police departments issue their officers Kevlar vests to stop bullets, and thick helmets and even shields to protect them from bottles and bricks. But there is nothing in the equipment room to give an officer thicker skin. That tool — as vital to an officer’s safety and the public’s as anything clipped to his belt — is developed in training, and its strength differs from one officer to the next. The issue of tolerance, in fact, lies at the heart of the dispute surrounding the arrest of the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. in Cambridge, Mass. The police say Professor Gates was arrested and briefly charged with disorderly conduct after he ignored warnings to stop haranguing an officer who had asked him for identification inside his home. Though Professor Gates said he was not abusive and was the victim of racism, the police report said he told Sgt. James M. Crowley, “I’ll speak with your mama outside.” Several officers interviewed in four cities on Friday said they tried to ignore such remarks. Others said they had zero tolerance for being treated disrespectfully in public. The line of when to put on handcuffs is a personal and blurry one, varying among officers in the same city, the same precinct, even the same patrol car. A mounted police officer who has been with the Los Angeles Police Department for 25 years said that taking verbal abuse was a regular part of his job. “We don’t get to tell people what they want to hear,” said the Los Angeles officer, who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being quoted on duty. “Whether we’re giving them a ticket or responding to some conflict between a husband and wife, we’re not dealing with people at their best, and if you don’t have a tough skin, then you shouldn’t be a cop.” The officer said he recently confronted a woman walking in the middle of the street and asked her to step out of traffic. She refused and became belligerent, using a string of four-letter words and ethnic epithets. He said he wrote the woman a ticket and went on his way. But in Brooklyn, a 24-year-old officer, with three years on the force, seemed less inclined to walk away from verbal abuse. “We say, ‘Back down,’ ” he said. “If they don’t back down and start making direct threats, that’s an offense. They don’t get a free pass.” He said that threats could be defined in different ways, and he preferred to talk people down, but that the rules changed if a crowd formed, which was routine in New York and also occurred during the Gates incident. “I wouldn’t back down if there’s a crowd gathering,” the Brooklyn officer said, in part out of concern of sending a message of weakness that could haunt another officer later. “We’re a band of brothers. We have to be there to help each other out. If there’s a group and they’re throwing out slurs and stuff, you have to handle it.” A 13-year veteran of the Denver police force, who did not wish to give his name, said likewise. “We’re not going to take abuse,” he said. “We have to remain in control. We’re running the show.” But Robert Anderson, with the same department five years, said he tried to “let people vent” if they grew irate. “People usually aren’t happy to see the police,” he said. “They’d rather see a fireman.” In New York, State Senator Eric Adams, a retired New York City police captain and co-founder of the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement, said the rules for dealing with someone differed by setting. “If it’s their house, they’re allowed to call you all sorts of names,” Mr. Adams said. “A man’s house is his castle. If they’re in the street, and they don’t listen to the officer’s warning, ‘Sir, you’re being disorderly,’ you can lock them up at this time.” Not that the officer necessarily should, he said. “Let’s say I do a stop,” Mr. Adams said. “I question, and it’s nothing. ‘Sir, I’m sorry, I apologize.’ What’s the reason for staying, if the anger’s directed at me? If it’s directed at a third party, a storekeeper, I stay.” But if the officer himself is the provocation, the officer should leave, he said, and added that Sergeant Crowley did not use such common sense. Michael J. Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association in New York, took a harder line and said officers should not tolerate disrespect on the street. “We pay these officers to risk their lives every day,” Mr. Palladino said. “We’re taught that officers should have a thicker skin and be a little immune to some comments. But not to the point where you are abused in public. You don’t get paid to be publicly abused. There are laws that protect against that.” In Atlanta, Officer M. Tate, who would not give his first name, said he was trained not to lose his cool — or his job — by reacting to name calling. He recalled from memory the exact definition of when a person’s behavior crossed the line into being worthy of arrest: “The set of circumstances that will lead a reasonable and prudent person to believe that a crime has or is about to be committed and that the person in question is involved in a significant manner.” Anything short of that, he said, does not warrant handcuffs. “I’ll take them yelling at me,” Officer Tate said. “Unless I’m hit or they get violent, I won’t arrest them for just yelling at me.” But the training cannot be applied to every situation, one officer said. “You want the training?” a detective in Queens asked. “Or how I train myself?” He described a scenario he had faced many times: stopping someone who he just saw appear to slip drugs to someone else, only to learn that was not the case. “ ‘Oh, it’s a cigarette. Oh, O.K., sorry to bother you,’ ” the detective said. And if the person then becomes verbally abusive? “If you locked everybody up that was technically disorderly — you’ve got to know which battles to fight,” he said. “If this guy’s causing commotion, there’s a scene, you look for the level-headed person who’s a friend of his. Say, ‘Look, we’re out here cleaning up your block.’ When you leave, they’re going to talk to him.” Senator Adams said black men were more likely to be locked up for what in police parlance is called getting “lippy.” “The ‘uppity Negro,’ ” he said. “You may not have committed a crime, but you know what? You’ve got a big mouth.”",

    "source": "Eyes Are Off the Court as the Knicks Get a Rare Win on It <eos> Basketball again felt like a backdrop for the Knicks on Friday. The team, one of the N.B.A. leaders in off-court distractions, was preparing for a game against the Utah Jazz, but the focus was instead on whether Carmelo Anthony might be headed to Chicago and Phil Jackson might be headed to New York. It had been two days since the Knicks beat the Timberwolves in Minnesota, snapping a seven-game losing streak. The time in between that game and the one on Friday at Madison Square Garden was not filled with stories of what the Knicks had finally done right on the court. Rather, the conversation immediately shifted, first to reports that Chicago’s Joakim Noah had spoken to Anthony during the recent All-Star weekend in New Orleans and had urged him to sign with the Bulls if he opted out of his contract with the Knicks at the end of this season. The possibility that he might do so, leaving a Knicks team in disarray for a Bulls team with far more potential, understandably gives the Knicks nightmares. Image Reports suggest the Knicks may be interested in Phil Jackson. Credit Frazer Harrison/Getty Images After the Knicks soundly beat the Jazz, 108-81, Anthony denied having a conversation with Noah. “I can’t have that conversation,” he said. Anthony added that he expected several more months of similar reports until he decided what he wanted to do. “Without a doubt,” he said. “Everybody will have their own take on different stories. I’ve got to focus on ball, and whatever stories is going to be out there, I can’t control that.” Speaking to reporters in Chicago, Noah would also not say much, moving to change the subject when asked about the conversation during the Bulls’ morning shootaround Friday. “What does that have to do with our team right now?” Noah said. “It doesn’t matter.” Perhaps it was not a coincidence that one day after the Noah story emerged, there were reports, not publicly confirmed by the Knicks, that they had recently approached Jackson about coming to New York, presumably to fill a role in the front office. Image Carmelo Anthony, left, guarded by Utah’s Richard Jefferson, scored 29 points in only three quarters in the Knicks’ victory. Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times Left to address all this, as usual, was the beleaguered Mike Woodson, who has dealt with speculation about his job security for much of the season and who, in the continued absence of any other Knicks officials willing to speak on behalf of the team, is often left to answer all the questions. On Thursday, he went on ESPN Radio and was asked about Noah and Anthony. “You know, legally, nobody can recruit anyone,” Woodson said. “You can’t do that at this point. Melo is still wearing a Knicks uniform, and I hope he stays with the Knicks for the rest of his career.” On Friday, Woodson struck a particularly defiant tone when asked before the game about speculation that Jackson and Knicks General Manager Steve Mills had met. One report said Jackson had been asked to coach the Knicks, although the possibility that Jackson will ever coach anywhere again seems unlikely. “I’m the coach of the Knicks,” Woodson said, even showing a hint of a smile. Jackson, who last coached in the N.B.A. in the 2010-11 season and has never had an established front-office role with a team, has long been viewed as a possible New York savior, in part because of his many accomplishments and because, as a player in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he played a role in the Knicks’ only championship era. There has always been the notion that there would come a day that Jackson would want to return to where it all began and complete his career arc. Image Mike Woodson said, “I’m the coach of the Knicks.” Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times If the Knicks have approached Jackson in recent weeks, it would not be the first time they have done so. In 1999, when the Knicks were battling to stay in the playoff picture and Jackson was between coaching jobs, Dave Checketts, then the Garden’s president, began to hold clandestine talks with Jackson, hoping to get him to replace Jeff Van Gundy as the Knicks’ coach. But the Knicks made a surprising run that year, reaching the N.B.A. finals, and Jackson ended up in Los Angeles, where he coached the Lakers to five titles. It is unclear if Jackson might have more inclination to join the Knicks now and finish his career where it began. It is also unclear if he would be willing to work under the Knicks’ often-derided owner, James L. Dolan. What is known is that Jackson provided input to the Pistons’ president, Joe Dumars, on the hiring of Maurice Cheeks as Detroit’s coach, although Cheeks was eventually fired on Feb. 10. Woodson, to the surprise of many, has not been fired, and before Friday’s game he maintained that his team still had “an opportunity to make the playoffs” despite everything that had occurred. Amar’e Stoudemire echoed Woodson’s thoughts. “We’ve been through it this year,” he said, adding that when a team is not winning, “it opens the door for a lot of rumors.” For the Knicks, it is a whole bunch of open doors. And it is not clear who exactly is leaving, or arriving. REBOUNDS Coach Mike Woodson said Kenyon Martin was out of his walking boot but had yet to resume basketball activities. Martin has not played since Feb. 1 because of a chronic left ankle injury. “Still not there yet,” Woodson said. “How far out that he is, I have no idea at this point.”",

    "source": "French Suspect Articles in Le Monde Set Off Market Panic <eos> PARIS — Misunderstandings between the French and visiting British vacationers are a traditional feature of summers in France. But did a British malentendu over another French summer staple — a fictional series of articles in Le Monde — contribute to a mysterious sell-off in French bank stocks last week? That is the question that French politicians, business leaders and journalists — at least those who are left in Paris during the dog days of August — are asking, as they struggle to explain the plunge, which was accompanied by concerns about the country’s ability to pay back its debts. The series, “End of the Line for the Euro,” looked at how a collapse of the single currency might play out, against the backdrop of French presidential elections next year. While the 12-part story was clearly labeled as fiction, it named real banks, like Société Générale , whose shares plunged 15 percent last Wednesday, prompting the bank to deny speculation that it was in financial trouble. As market participants and journalists searched for possible reasons, the trail seemed to lead to London. There, The Mail on Sunday, a tabloid newspaper, had published an article in which it said Société Générale was “on the brink of disaster.” Société Générale and an Italian bank, UniCredit, were in a “perilous” state, the paper added, citing “a senior government source.” Last Tuesday, two days after the report appeared, The Mail retracted it, writing, “We now accept that this was not true and we unreservedly apologize to Société Générale for any embarrassment caused.” Readers of the fictional “End of the Line for the Euro” noticed that Société Générale and UniCredit were both named in the same passage in the series, in an imaginary conversation involving the hedge fund manager John Paulson, where he says that U.S. regulators have been raising concerns about the liquidity of the two banks. On Wednesday, a journalist at the Reuters news agency, Natalie Huet, speculated about a possibility of a link between the tale in Le Monde and the story in The Mail on Sunday. “The rumor of a collapse of SocGen could have come from a misreading of the summer series in Le Monde by The Daily Mail,” she wrote on the blogging site Twitter, referring to the weekday sister publication of The Mail on Sunday. Ms. Huet subsequently clarified that her comment was based on the “words of traders” and was merely intended to relay a “funny and not impossible hypothesis.” She also specified that she had been commenting in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the news agency. Ms. Huet did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment. The story took off from there. On Thursday, the news agency Agence France-Presse asserted, in an article that it later killed, that the Le Monde series “was the source of false information that has largely contributed to Société Générale’s stock market drop.” On Friday, the French economy minister, François Baroin, discussed the possible connection in a radio interview. By the weekend, the talk had grown so loud that Le Monde was moved to defend itself in a front-page editorial by Erik Izraelewicz, its top editorial executive. “The reality is that our fiction had nothing to do with this crazy rumor,” Mr. Izraelewicz wrote in the Sunday-Monday edition of Le Monde. “The paradox is that this case has come to illustrate something that our series denounced: the unacceptable role played by rumors in determining the fate of nations and businesses.” In the series, the fictional collapse of the euro zone is fueled by market rumors — spread by British traders, to bring things full circle — that Germany intended to pull out of the euro zone. That set in motion a disastrous cycle of events. The scrutiny comes at an awkward time for Le Monde, less than a year after it was taken over by a group of French business executives with links to the opposition Socialist Party, and less than a year before French presidential elections, which are set for next May. (In the fictional series, the voting results in disaster for the Socialists, who finish third behind the incumbent, President Nicolas Sarkozy, and the National Front leader, Marine Le Pen.) Even before the series ran, from late July through early August, it was the subject of complaints from Le Monde journalists, who issued a news release to protest the decision by Mr. Izraelewicz to give the plum assignment to a reporter at La Tribune, a business newspaper that he previously edited. Mr. Izraelewicz was named to the top job at Le Monde in February. Société Générale actually fared better in Le Monde’s fiction than another French lender, Crédit Agricole. That bank wrote a letter of complaint to the newspaper after it was portrayed as requiring a costly bailout. The French market regulator, the A.M.F., is investigating the source of the speculation about Société Générale, which was accompanied by talk, denied by ratings agencies, that France’s triple-A credit status might be at risk. Société Générale declined to elaborate on the nature of the investigation, which came at its request. “Regarding the unfounded rumors circulating on the bank, Société Générale received the public apology from the Mail on Sunday, recognizing that their article was not true, and the group made a request to the A.M.F. — which was accepted — to open an enquiry into the origin of these irresponsible rumors,” the bank said in a statement. As for The Mail on Sunday, a senior executive, who insisted that he not be identified because he is not an official spokesman, dismissed talk of a link to the series in Le Monde. Neither the paper’s reporters nor its sources had been aware of “End of the Line for the Euro,” the executive said.",

    "source": "Leader in Austerity Push Appointed Head of Greek Central Bank <eos> ATHENS — The next governor of Greece’s central bank will be Yannis Stournaras, a Greek economist and former finance minister who led a two-year austerity drive that stabilized the economy but fueled a social crisis. The announcement on Wednesday, by the General Council of the Bank of Greece, followed a sweeping cabinet shuffle on Monday that installed Gikas Hardouvelis, another economist and former government adviser, as Greece’s new finance minister. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras overhauled his government to give it new momentum after a weak showing in European Parliament elections last month. Although Mr. Stournaras, 57, was widely credited with guiding Greece’s return to international bond markets in April and paving the way for crucial debt relief talks in the autumn, he was seen as politically spent after introducing tough measures that have slashed incomes and pushed unemployment to 27 percent. His appointment to the central bank was widely expected to ensure continuity in the government’s reform drive, which international creditors have called for. Image Yannis Stournaras is credited with guiding Greece’s return to international bond markets in April. Credit Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters Mr. Stournaras, a former banker, would take over from the current Bank of Greece governor, George Provopoulos, whose six-year term expires on June 19. Cabinet approval is considered a formality. Mr. Samaras thanked Mr. Provopoulos on Wednesday for his service, saying the outgoing governor “contributed decisively to the stability of the financial system and the recapitalization of Greek banks in the most difficult postwar period our country has experienced.” Despite the efforts by Mr. Provopoulos, Greece’s banking sector is still struggling with the repercussions of the country’s debt crisis, with nonperforming loans amounting to 40 percent of the total held by Greek lenders. In a report on Greece’s reform progress published on Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund warned that Greek banks “face a mountain of bad loans that will require adequate capital and oversight to clean up.” The I.M.F., the European Commission and the European Central Bank have extended Greece two bailouts worth 240 billion euros, or roughly $325 billion, since May 2010 in return for putting into effect a raft of painful austerity measures including cuts to salaries and pensions, as well as tax increases. In his new role, which also puts him on the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, Mr. Stournaras will seek to improve the fortunes of the Greek banks that will undergo E.C.B. stress tests this fall to determine their additional capital needs. The appointment of Mr. Stournaras to the Bank of Greece received a terse response from the leftist Syriza party, which won last month’s European Parliament elections on a fiercely anti-austerity platform. “Mr. Stournaras will continue to defend bailout policies from his new post,” Panos Skourletis, party spokesman, said.",

    "source": "Geoffrey Burbidge, Who Traced Life to Stardust, Is Dead at 84 <eos> Geoffrey Burbidge, an English physicist who became a towering figure in astronomy by helping to explain how people and everything else are made of stardust, died on Jan. 26 in San Diego. He was 84. His death, at Scripps Memorial Hospital, came after a long illness, said the University of California, San Diego . Dr. Burbidge was a physics professor there for more than four decades and lived in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego. A large man with an even larger voice, Dr. Burbidge was one of the last surviving giants of the postwar era of astronomy, when big telescopes were sprouting on mountain peaks in the Southwest and peeling back the sky, revealing a universe more diverse and violent than anybody had dreamed: radio galaxies and quasars erupting with gargantuan amounts of energy, pulsars and black holes pinpricking the cosmos, and lacy chains of galaxies rushing endlessly away into eternity. As the director of Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, Dr. Burbidge pushed to open big telescopes to a larger community of astronomers. As a senior astronomer at the university in San Diego, he was, to the consternation of most of his colleagues, a witty and acerbic critic of the Big Bang theory. In 1957, in a long, groundbreaking paper in The Reviews of Modern Physics, Dr. Burbidge; his wife, E. Margaret Burbidge; William Fowler of the California Institute of Technology; and Fred Hoyle of Cambridge University — a collaboration noted by their initials B2FH — laid out the way that thermonuclear reactions in stars could slowly seed a universe that was originally pure hydrogen, helium and lithium, the simplest elements in the periodic table, with heavier elements like oxygen, iron, carbon and others from which life is derived. Stars like the Sun burn hydrogen into helium to generate heat and light for most of their lives, until they run out of fuel and fizzle, or so the story goes. But more massive stars can go on to ignite helium to produce carbon and oxygen and so forth. Eventually the star explodes, tossing the newly minted atoms into space, where they mix with gas and dust and are incorporated into future stars. Successive generations of stars that coalesce from cosmic dust, burn and then explode would thus make the universe ever richer in heavy elements. Allan Sandage of Carnegie Observatories, an old friend of Dr. Burbidge’s, once explained it this way: “Every one of our chemical elements was once inside a star. The same star. You and I are brothers. We came from the same supernova.” Or as the singer Joni Mitchell put it, “We are stardust.” In a recent interview, Dr. Sandage described the B2FH collaboration’s work as “one of the major papers of the century.” “It changed the whole landscape of the chemical evolution of the universe,” he said. Geoffrey Ronald Burbidge was born in 1925 in Chipping Norton in England, in the Cotswolds hills halfway between Oxford and Stratford-on-Avon. His father, Leslie, was a builder. His mother, Evelyn, was a milliner. He was an only child and the first of his family to progress beyond grammar school. He attended the University of Bristol intending to study history, but on discovering he could stay in college longer if he enrolled in physics, he did, and found he liked it. He furthered his studies at University College, London, from which he received a Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1951. Another turning point for him came when he befriended a recent Ph.D., Margaret Peachey, in a lecture course in London. An assistant director of the university’s observatory at the time, she would become a prominent astronomer in her own right. They married in 1948. She survives him, along with a daughter, Sarah Burbidge of San Francisco, and a grandson. It was under his wife’s influence that Dr. Burbidge became interested in the physics of stars, tagging along on observing trips as her assistant. He always joked that he had become an astronomer by marrying one. On occasion the roles switched. Margaret’s application to observe on Mount Wilson, the mountain overlooking Pasadena, Calif., where modern cosmology began, was turned down on the grounds that there was no separate women’s bathroom. Dr. Burbidge booked the telescope time himself and his wife posed as his assistant, but they had to stay in an unheated cabin on the mountain, away from a dormitory housing other astronomers. After stops by the Burbidges at Harvard, the University of Chicago and Cambridge University, Dr. Fowler arranged for them and Dr. Hoyle to go to Pasadena to complete the stellar nucleosynthesis work, for which Dr. Fowler was later awarded a Nobel Prize . Margaret Burbidge obtained a post at the California Institute of Technology, while Geoffrey Burbidge got a job at the Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories. The Burbidges landed at the University of California, San Diego, in 1962. By then astronomers had been riveted by the discovery of quasars: bright pointlike objects that were pouring out radio waves and whose visible light was severely shifted toward longer, redder wavelengths, like the sound of a siren going away, indicating that they were moving away at high velocity. According to the standard interpretation of life in an expanding universe, these redshifts, as they are called, meant that quasars were at great distance. As a trained physicist, Dr. Burbidge was one of the first astronomers to investigate what could possibly be supplying the energy of such objects. At a meeting in Paris in 1958, he pointed out that the energy requirements for radio galaxies were already bumping up against the limits of known astrophysics. “That was a very important development,” Dr. Sandage said. In time, that line of thinking would lead to the idea that quasars and radio galaxies were powered by the gravity of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies, a widely held notion today. Dr. Burbidge, however, soon parted ways with his colleagues on quasars and indeed on the Big Bang itself. The great energies required to produce them and their smallness led him to question whether quasars really were at cosmological distances. His doubts were buttressed by observations by Halton C. Arp, now of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, suggesting that quasars were concentrated around nearby active galaxies and might have been shot out of them. A debate ensued, and almost all astronomers agree that it was one that Dr. Burbidge and his friends finally lost. The overwhelming consensus among astronomers is that the redshifts are what they appear to be, said Peter Strittmatter, director of the Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona. Dr. Burbidge’s skepticism extended to cosmology. In 1990, he and four other astronomers, including Drs. Arp and Hoyle, published a broadside in the journal Nature listing arguments against the Big Bang. Dr. Burbidge preferred instead a version of Dr. Hoyle’s Steady State theory of an eternal universe. In the new version, small, local big bangs originating in the nuclei of galaxies every 20 billion years or so kept the universe boiling. To his annoyance, most other astronomers ignored this view. In a memoir in 2007, Dr. Burbidge wrote that this quasi-steady state theory was probably closer to the truth than the Big Bang. But he added that “there is such a heavy bias against any minority point of view in cosmology that it may take a very long time for this to occur.” Despite his contrarian ways, Dr. Burbidge maintained his credibility in the astronomical establishment, serving as director of Kitt Peak from 1978 to 1984 and editing the prestigious Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics for more than 30 years. He was “a very clear-thinking heretic,” Dr. Strittmatter said. Dr. Strittmatter recalled that as a young astronomer he was terrified of Dr. Burbidge. “Then I learned that what he liked was a good argument,” he said. The Kitt Peak observatory had been built with support from the National Science Foundation as a sort of counterweight to the famous observatories in California like Mount Wilson and Palomar, whose giant telescopes were privately owned and available to only a few. Dr. Burbidge believed that Kitt Peak should act more as a service facility for all astronomers. “His idea was to open up astronomy to all qualified astronomers,” Dr. Sandage said. Dr. Burbidge never lost what Dr. Strittmatter called a “rebel’s instinct.” Dr. Sandage said Dr. Burbidge had called him up three times a week for 40 years to argue about the Big Bang. “He delighted in bringing up all the details that didn’t quite fit,” Dr. Sandage said. In recent years, he added, as the evidence for the Big Bang mounted, Dr. Burbidge held his ground. “I just didn’t understand that,” Dr. Sandage said. “I often wondered if he was just arguing with me to keep on the phone.”",

    "source": "Merkel Heads to China to Keep Alive ‘Golden Decade’ of Deals <eos> BERLIN — With some experts warning that the “golden decade” of rapid growth in German-Chinese trade and dealings may be ending, Chancellor Angela Merkel embarks this weekend on her seventh visit to China, accompanied by top people from German business who, surveys indicate, are still markedly more optimistic about China than are their European counterparts. Like many people raised in Communist East Germany, where travel abroad was tightly restricted, Ms. Merkel is an avid traveler. As a trained scientist, she is also keenly interested in innovation, and in China she always travels to Beijing and at least one other province for a firsthand look at joint ventures and new Chinese research and enterprises. This trip takes her first to Chengdu, capital of western Sichuan Province, which, government officials noted, has a population almost as big as Germany’s 82 million. In Chengdu, she will meet the province’s leadership and visit a joint venture operated by the German automaker Volkswagen and a social center designed to help the children of migrant workers. From there, Ms. Merkel flies to Beijing, where she will be received with military honors by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and attend a dinner hosted by President Xi Jinping, but also meet film directors and address students at Tsinghua University. Both government officials and experts who discussed the trip said that human rights matters, such as any eventual request from Ms. Merkel for China to permit the artist Ai Weiwei to attend his current big show in Berlin, would be dealt with quietly, if raised at all. Ms. Merkel has been in power since 2005, making her one of the longer-serving heads of government in Europe. She and the German business community have forged strong business and political ties with China — this year alone, President Xi was in Germany in March; Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited China in mid-April and Sigmar Gabriel, the vice chancellor and economics minister, in late April. While in China on Sunday through Tuesday, Ms. Merkel will oversee the creation of a new economic committee to prepare the ground for high-level talks in Berlin in October designed to map cooperation for the next several years. Just before Ms. Merkel arrives in Chengdu, senior German and Chinese business people, academics and politicians are meeting on education and innovation. Among the Chinese attendees are Jack Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba Group; Ge Honglin, the mayor of Chengdu; and several academics. The German team is headed by Martin Brudermüller, a member of the board of BASF. German officials and experts discussing the trip with reporters said recent years have shown that an agenda of social reform can be pursued most effectively in such meetings, enabling China’s leaders to keep matters they deem sensitive behind closed doors. Image A Volkswagen plant in Foshan, China. German businesses have forged strong ties in the country. Credit Chinafotopress/Getty Images Business has boomed in recent years. In 2000, government figures show, China accounted for 1.6 percent of all German exports. Last year, that had risen to 6.1 percent of all exports. Government officials, insisting they not be identified, said China is now Germany’s No. 3 market, after France and the Netherlands. German businessmen are also more confident than their European counterparts that investment in China is worthwhile. Surveys from the European Chamber and in Germany suggest that many Europeans are seeking alternative markets, due to increased costs in China, competition from Chinese companies and problems with market access. The share of European businesses that wants to expand in China dropped to 57 percent this year from 86 percent a year earlier, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. German businessmen “are significantly more optimistic,” the institute said this week, citing a 2014 business confidence survey by the foreign trade chamber. “We have had a golden decade in bilateral relations,” said Sebastian Heilmann, director of the Mercator Institute. He noted, however, that “more troubled waters” might lie ahead. German experts said the current anticorruption campaign in China has cut significantly into sales there of French luxury goods such as fine liquors and perfume — favorite gifts for the Chinese elite, who are now worried about the crackdown. For German businesses, experts who insisted on anonymity said that there was danger in the tightening credit in the Chinese banking system. Delays of six months in getting payment are harmful for the many medium-sized or small German enterprises, often family-run, that are the backbone of Germany’s export economy and have done booming trade with China in the past 10 years. Experts also noted that Chinese companies are developing rapidly and becoming ever more competitive with German business. The government did not release a list of the business people accompanying Ms. Merkel, but her delegation traditionally includes a mix from Germany’s leading Dax 30 companies and smaller companies. Among the foreign policy issues likely to be raised in Beijing is Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces continue to fight. Ms. Merkel has been most active in trying to end the bloodshed, warning of further European sanctions if it does not stop. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was in China in May and reached what was billed as a landmark deal to sell Russian gas to the Chinese. The price has not been disclosed. German officials noted, however, that it will be at least a decade before deliveries reach capacity.",

    "source": "N.F.L. and Officials Still at Odds on Retirement Benefits <eos> The N.F.L. sent a memo to its teams Sunday indicating that it thought Friday that it was close to a deal to end the lockout of officials but that negotiations broke off the next day after a brief meeting in which officials made clear that retirement benefits remained the key sticking point. Now, people on both sides say it is doubtful a deal can be completed in time to use regular officials for Week 1, which starts Wednesday when the Giants host the Cowboys. “Not sure how long this will drag on at this point,” one person briefed on the negotiations said Sunday. The lead negotiator for the officials, Michael Arnold, said the N.F.L.’s memo provided “false and misleading information.” “It continues to mystify any objective observer of the situation why the N.F.L. would jeopardize the safety of its players, the integrity of the game and the quality of its product in order to continue its attack on its professional referees,” Arnold said in a statement. According to the memo, Commissioner Roger Goodell, in a conversation with the referee Jeff Triplette, a member of the officials’ union negotiating committee, was told last week that the financial gap between the league’s offer and the officials’ demands was $4 million a year. The memo said the league told Triplette that it would increase its offer by $1 million a year above the $1.5 million that had already been proposed, to be used either to increase compensation or as part of the league’s proposal to convert the officials’ retirement plan to a 401(k) from the more traditional pension they have now. That was a shift for the league, which had taken a hard line with officials since their last negotiation in July. In the meantime, replacement officials were used during the preseason with uneven, sometimes embarrassing, results. Goodell made it clear, the memo said, that the increase was offered with the intent of closing a deal over the weekend, in time for the officials to work the first week of games, and that the officials should not schedule a meeting if that was not their intent. The memo said that in a conversation Friday, Triplette confirmed to Goodell that union representatives were coming to New York to conclude negotiations within the new parameters. In his statement, Arnold said that any claim that numbers were agreed to before Saturday was “absolutely false.” When the sides met Saturday morning, the memo said, the officials said they would not settle based on those parameters. Scott Green, the president of the officials’ union, told league negotiators that Triplette had “no authority to make that deal” and that the increase of $1 million a year was nowhere near enough to complete a deal. The memo said the officials reverted to their position from before the lockout began in June, which the league said meant there was an economic gap of $70 million over the life of the deal. The union wants all current officials to remain part of the current pension plan, with a 20 percent increase in the pension benefit. New officials would have a 401(k).",

    "source": "Obama and Xi Jinping of China Agree to Steps on Cybertheft <eos> WASHINGTON — President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China took their first concrete steps on Friday toward reining in the rising threat of cyberattacks between the world’s two largest economies, pledging that their governments would refrain from computer-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain even as Mr. Obama suggested that he might still impose sanctions if rampant Chinese hacking persisted. With Mr. Xi standing beside him at a Rose Garden news conference, Mr. Obama said the two had reached a “common understanding” that neither the United States nor China should engage in state-sponsored cyberintrusions to poach intellectual property, and that they would together seek “international rules of the road for appropriate conduct in cyberspace.” But Mr. Obama said that he had told the Chinese president during two hours of meetings at the White House that the escalating cycle of cyberattacks against American targets “has to stop,” warning Mr. Xi that the United States would go after and punish perpetrators of those offenses through traditional law enforcement tools and, potentially, with sanctions. “The question now is, ‘Are words followed by actions?’ ”Mr. Obama said of China’s commitments on cyberthreats. “And we will be watching carefully to make an assessment as to whether progress has been made in this area.” It was the third set of meetings between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi in the last three years, and it came at a potential pivot point in United States-China relations, with the Obama administration determined to find areas where it can cooperate with Beijing but increasingly wary of its behavior. Besides their meeting at the White House, the two presidents spent more than two and a half hours together Thursday night at a private dinner at Blair House, across from the White House. At their news conference, both Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi made an effort to demonstrate that they had made progress on curbing cyberattacks, even as they skirted direct references to some of the most contentious issues, including the United States’ claim that China was behind the theft of security dossiers on roughly 22 million Americans from the Office of Personnel Management. “Confrontation and friction are not the right choice,” Mr. Xi said. “Confrontation will lead to losses on both sides.” The pledge on cybersecurity — a hard-fought and not entirely expected bit of progress that was still under negotiation until the final hours before the two presidents met — came as Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi sought to spotlight their cooperation on the world stage. They hailed progress on climate change , with Mr. Xi announcing a new commitment to start a national cap-and-trade system in 2017 to curb greenhouse gas emissions, and both countries outlining ambitious goals for reaching a global climate pact at a December summit meeting in Paris, including winning commitments from every country to reduce emissions. They also celebrated their cooperation on the nuclear accord with Iran and said they were both committed to pressing ahead against the North Korean nuclear problem, which has defied solution for more than 20 years. But there was ample evidence, even as Mr. Obama welcomed Mr. Xi with a 21-gun salute and a state dinner on Friday night, that the two nations remain deeply at odds on key issues. Speaking in the Rose Garden, they clashed over China’s reclamation of islands in the South China Sea, which Mr. Xi defiantly defended, suggesting that China’s buildup on artificial islands in the strategic waterway would move ahead and flatly denying that it was militarizing any territory. Mr. Obama said he told Mr. Xi that he had “significant concerns” over the activities, “which makes it harder for countries in the region to resolve disagreements peacefully.” While the United States has no territorial claim in the waters, he added, “we just want to make sure that the rules of the road are upheld.” The Chinese president stuck to his guns, bluntly asserting, “We have the right to uphold our own territorial sovereignty and lawful and legitimate maritime rights and interests.” Mr. Xi said China’s construction activities “do not target or impact any country, and China does not intend to pursue militarization.” The exchange underscored the degree to which Mr. Xi has in many ways confounded Mr. Obama’s hopes and expectations. “As the most powerful leader in China in decades, Mr. Xi presented an opportunity for greater collaboration,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser on Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Instead, he “turned out to be an ultranationalist, bent on achieving the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation even if it meant damaging ties with the U.S. as well as China’s neighbors.” In another point of friction, Mr. Obama said he had deep concerns over human rights in China, describing what sounded like a lecture he had given to Mr. Xi about the issue. “I expressed in candid terms our strong views that preventing journalists, lawyers, NGOs and civil society groups from operating freely, or closing churches or denying ethnic minorities equal treatment, are all problematic in our view, and actually prevent China and its people from realizing its full potential,” Mr. Obama said, using an acronym for nongovernmental organizations, which face strict restrictions under proposed legislation in China. The stern message elicited only a generic response from Mr. Xi, who said democracy and human rights were “the common procedure of mankind,” but then added, “We must recognize that countries have different historical processes and realities, that we need to respect people of all countries in the right to choose their own development independently.” Even the agreement on cybersecurity left room for differences. The United States and China said they would cooperate with requests to investigate cybercrimes and, according to a White House fact sheet, “mitigate malicious cyberactivity emanating from their territory.” But while Mr. Obama said they had agreed on “the principle that governments don’t engage in cyberespionage for commercial gain against companies,” Mr. Xi said nothing of computer-enabled spying, speaking only of “cybercrime,” a narrower formulation. The two countries also embraced a United Nations accord, adopted in July, that commits the signatories not to target one another’s critical infrastructure — such as power plants, cellphone networks and financial transactions — in peacetime. But that leaves open many questions, since there are many definitions of what constitutes critical infrastructure. The morning began with an elaborate White House welcome, complete with cannons reverberating across the South Lawn as a military band played “March of Volunteers,” the anthem of the People’s Republic of China since the 1949 revolution, and “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The two leaders strolled across the grass reviewing neat rows of troops, then stopped to shake hands with crowds of children waving American and Chinese flags, including some who attend Washington Yu Ying Academy, a Chinese immersion school. Later, they announced a “One Million Strong” initiative that aims to have a million American students learning Mandarin by 2020. Both pro- and anti-China protesters were kept a block from the White House throughout the meeting, and the day’s events went off without an incident like the heckling that so angered the Chinese when President George W. Bush hosted Mr. Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, in 2006 .",

    "source": "In the ‘Glee’ Era, Youth Choruses Pop Up All Over <eos> Running a youth chorus is a daunting task. The repertory has to suit young singers, and the experience has to keep tweeting, texting children entertained. Then there’s the tricky issue regarding boys: what to do when their voices break. Despite these challenges, young people’s choirs are flourishing in the Bay Area. Thanks to the commitment of talented choral directors — and the popularity of TV shows like “Glee” — youth choirs in the region are in a golden era. There are about 40 independent children’s vocal ensembles in the region, and many are earning wide recognition for the complexity and variety of their output and the creativity of their collaborations. “I’m struck by the quantity and quality of children’s choruses in the Bay Area,” said Ann Meier Baker, the president and C.E.O. of Chorus America, a service organization for choirs in the United States. “These ensembles are world class.” Last week the San Francisco Girls Chorus (which, alongside the San Francisco Boys Chorus , performed at President Obama’s inauguration in 2009) became the first American vocal ensemble to win a place in the finals of “Let the Peoples Sing,” a prestigious international choral competition organized by the European Broadcasting Union. One of only three youth choirs from around the globe to make the cut, the San Francisco Girls Chorus plans to travel to Manchester, England, in October to compete against groups from Estonia and Sweden. “We were so excited to learn we were submitted to the competition,” said Teresa Dayrit, a 13-year-old member of the San Francisco Girls Chorus. “When we learned that just two other youth choruses besides us would be in the finals we felt super proud.” In “Fable and Faith,” a multimedia performance featuring the San Francisco Boys Chorus and the Robert Moses’ Kin dance company at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (Feb. 18-20), the choristers will sing seven numbers including music from the movie “Under the Tuscan Sun” and the Lacrimosa from Mozart’s Requiem. The boys may also get to kick soccer balls and ride skateboards onstage. The Ragazzi Boys Chorus , which is planning to tour Cuba this summer, is working on a piece for its March 26 concert that incorporates animal sounds and complex chord clusters. And the Pacific Boychoir Academy , one of the few “choir schools” in the country offering choral training alongside an academic day-school program, regularly takes on tough repertory, like Sergei Rachmaninoff’s Vespers, that is beyond the reach of most youth choirs. The Grammy Award -winning chorus is releasing a new CD of spirituals this spring. The success of the Bay Area’s top youth choirs, which generally meet one to three times a week after school and maintain a rigorous performance, touring and workshop schedule, owes much to the vision and dedication of their leaders. Karl Chang founded the Crystal Children’s Choir , a highly regarded children’s chorus based in the South Bay, in 1994 to meet educational needs. “When I arrived here as an immigrant from Taiwan, many public schools didn’t have a music program,” Mr. Chang said. “So some friends and I decided to form a children’s choir to teach music.” Today the Crystal Children’s Choir has 1,000 members and locations in the Bay Area, Taiwan and China. Other Bay Area choruses have also grown substantially. In January, 60 children auditioned for a place in the Ragazzi Boys Chorus — double the number that auditioned five years ago. In the mid-1990s, the San Francisco Boys Chorus had 60 singers. Today there are around 260. “I love being in the San Francisco Boys Chorus because I enjoy making music in a professional atmosphere,” said one San Francisco Boys Chorus member, Elio Bucky, 13. The reasons for the growth can be explained in part by the decline of music education in public schools. Plus there’s the “Glee” factor. According to a recent poll by the National Association for Music Education, nearly half of the music teachers surveyed reported that “Glee” had increased interest in their offerings. The most acclaimed Bay Area youth choruses, whose after-school programs range from around $600 to $1,850 a year in student fees depending on the organization (scholarships are available), are striving to mitigate the budget cuts in music education and serve the surge in interest in singing prompted by pop culture. They offer music history and theory classes and training in vocal technique and repertory for children as young as 5 and as old as 18. A special understanding of young voices helps distinguish the top-tier youth choruses from the rest. Youth choral directors in the region, like Kevin Fox of the Pacific Boychoir Academy and Susan McMane of the San Francisco Girls Chorus, possess a deep knowledge of children’s vocal apparatus and repertory. “Collectively, the choir sounds quite mature because we work on things like intonation and vowel matching,” Ms. McMane said. The goal is not “to push the singers to sound old,” she added. “We want there to be a youthful vibrancy to the voices.”",

    "source": "Offense and Defense Fail Knicks Against Thunder <eos> OKLAHOMA CITY —As many as 31 points separated the Oklahoma City Thunder from the Knicks on Saturday night, but the gap between them could be measured in so many vivid ways: in talent, depth, athleticism, chemistry or cohesion. The Thunder simply had more of everything, and it showed in a 104-92 victory that was so much more lopsided than the scoreboard could indicate. Kevin Durant dominated, Russell Westbrook preened and James Harden drilled shot after shot, putting the game away by the middle of the third quarter, while James L. Dolan — the Madison Square Garden chairman — watched grumpily from a baseline seat. Carmelo Anthony , the Knicks’ most dynamic player, watched from the bench, resting a sprained right ankle. But even at full strength, the Knicks might have been no match for the Thunder’s spry, young lineup, which may be the best in the Western Conference. The Thunder’s core players are in their third season together and fit together seamlessly. The Knicks’ roster was slapped together over the past 12 months and is still full of holes, despite the star power of Anthony, Amar’e Stoudemire and Tyson Chandler. “It’s a new team for us, and those guys have been together for a while,” Stoudemire said. “And their chemistry and their camaraderie goes a long way. We got to definitely gain some experience.” In the meantime, there will be humiliating nights like this. Durant scored 28 points in three quarters, hardly breaking a sweat as he converted 10 of 13 shots and all seven of his free throws. Harden had 24 points, going 8 for 12. Westbrook (21 points) also put on a show, blowing on his fingers as if they were smoking guns, then “holstering” them at his sides. If the Knicks were offended, they did not show it, or do anything to make Westbrook reconsider. “You can do what you want when you’re winning,” said Bill Walker, who started in Anthony’s place. “It was up to us to stop him, and we didn’t. That’s what happens when you don’t.” So the Knicks (6-6) dropped back to .500 and lost for the fourth straight time here. They have not won a road game against the Thunder since the franchise relocated from Seattle in 2008. The Thunder (11-2) showed why they are widely favored to win the Western Conference, dominating from start to finish. They led by 23 points at halftime, and by 31 midway through the third quarter, allowing the starting lineup to take the fourth quarter off. With Anthony out, the Knicks’ scoring burden fell primarily to Stoudemire, but he mustered only 14 points, missed 12 of 19 shots and committed 5 turnovers, continuing his perplexing early-season struggles. Chandler and Toney Douglas added 14 points each. “It’s a little bit tough when teams are just loading up on you,” Stoudemire said of opposing defenses. “They’re playing you to drive and guys are already sagging in, and they know you’re going to shoot the shots, so they’re contested shots. It’s not easy right now.” Before tipoff, Anthony sat at his locker, gold-colored headphones over his ears, his eyes closed and his arms crossed — a picture of private contemplation or quiet frustration. He said his ankle was still tender and made no predictions about playing Monday against the Orlando Magic. He has yet to try running or cutting. “It’s frustrating,” he said, adding with a wry smile, “I mean, you see me over there sitting in the corner. I’m hibernating over here.” Dolan — who pushed through the trade for Anthony last February — stopped here on the way back from a business trip, only to see his prized small forward take the night off. Things could become worse in the week ahead, with a tough four-game homestand that concludes with a visit by the Denver Nuggets, Anthony’s former team. The Nuggets (8-4) have fared far better since the trade last February than the Knicks, who are still shuffling players and adjusting to an overhauled roster. Mike Bibby drew his first start at point guard Saturday, in place of the struggling Iman Shumpert. Coach Mike D’Antoni said it was probably temporary, and a product of matchups, but he also did not guarantee that Shumpert would return to point guard. With Bibby, the Knicks had their fourth starting lineup, and their third starter at point guard, a position that will remain unstable until Baron Davis gets healthy. The offense still sputtered, with the Knicks shooting 41 percent from the field and Shumpert going 3 for 10, for 6 points. Bibby finished with 6 points and 3 assists. Jared Jeffries also returned after a 10-game absence and missed all four of his field-goal attempts. “It’s just going to take a while,” D’Antoni said, sounding uncomfortable repeating the theme. “Almost always, we got at least one or two rookies on the floor and without a training camp — it’s just excuse, excuse. I don’t want to do that. Were just struggling right now a little bit.” He added: “Melo will be back pretty soon, and hopefully Baron’s around the corner. And then we’ll see what we got.”",

    "source": "Cyclist Jan Ullrich Penalized for Blood Doping <eos> After a prolonged delay, Jan Ullrich , the German who won the 1997 Tour de France , was suspended by a sports appeal body for two years Thursday for blood doping. Because Ullrich retired from racing five years ago, the penalty imposed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport is largely symbolic. It was the latest in a series of doping-related developments involving top cyclists over the past week. On Monday, the court sanctioned Alberto Contador, a three-time Tour winner, for using a banned drug . It also suspended him for two years. On Wednesday, French authorities searched the home of the four-time Olympic medalist Jeannie Longo and detained her husband on allegations that he illegally imported doping materials, presumably on her behalf. Last Friday, American prosecutors dropped a criminal investigation of Lance Armstrong , who holds the record of seven Tour wins, without charges, but an investigation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency continues. Ullrich was Armstrong’s closest rival at the Tour de France. But police raids on two apartments in Madrid belonging to a doctor in 2006 disrupted his career and ultimately led to Thursday’s decision. Many athletes, mainly cyclists, became the subject of investigations and the target of suspicions through Operación Puerto, the Spanish police action against Eufemiano Fuentes, who was once a doctor for two Spanish cycling teams. In a laboratory owned by Fuentes, the police found a large quantity of stored blood that appeared to belong to the teams. To avoid increasingly sophisticated drug tests in the 2000s, riders intent on cheating turned toward freezing their blood in the off-season, then putting it back into their bodies before or during races to increase their oxygen-carrying red blood cell count, a costly and complex process. Records at the laboratory identified one of the riders as “hijo Rudicio,” or Rudy’s son. Throughout his cycling career, Ullrich maintained a close professional relationship with Rudy Pevenage, his team director. The three-member Court of Arbitration for Sport tribunal found that there was substantial evidence that Ullrich used blood doping, including DNA evidence that linked his blood to samples found frozen in Feuntes’s lab.",

    "source": "Debate Over Gay Marriage Shifts to New Jersey <eos> TRENTON — The battle over same-sex marriage in New Jersey headed toward a legislative showdown Monday night, when a bill that would allow such unions narrowly cleared a key legislative committee and was set for a vote by the full State Senate. The 7-to-6 vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee — which came after years of efforts by gay rights advocates and a day of emotionally charged testimony by dozens of supporters and opponents of the bill — was the first time any legislative body in the state had ever approved a gay marriage bill. The approval brought cheers from hundreds of supporters who crammed the State House committee room. But the measure faces an uphill fight when it is put up for a vote on Thursday before the full Senate, where even supporters concede that they do not yet have the 21 votes needed to pass it. If it does pass, it will go to the Assembly, where passage is considered more likely. Speaking to jubilant supporters after the vote, Steven Goldstein, executive director of Garden State Equality, said that gay rights advocates had a lot of work to do in the next 72 hours, but said that momentum and history were on their side. “The marriage-equality movement in America starts again right here,” Mr. Goldstein said, as the crowd erupted with, “Right here.” But opponents of the bill said they had expected the committee to approve it and were confident that it would be defeated when it reached the Senate floor. “We’ve got a long way to go,” said Seriah Rein of the Council on the American Family . “And the will of the people, who do not support this, will be heard in the end.” After the New York State Senate rejected a gay marriage bill last week, the front line in the national battle over same-sex marriage shifted to New Jersey. And the uncertain fate of the bill there, in one of the most liberal states, has cheered many conservatives. Passage of the bill, considered a fait accompli by many legislators as recently as October, has been in jeopardy since Gov. Jon S. Corzine, a Democrat who supports gay marriage, was defeated in the election last month. That loss rattled some Democratic legislators who began to worry about riling religious and social conservatives by supporting a controversial social measure at a time of economic distress. Mr. Corzine, who pledged to sign a same-sex marriage bill, will be succeeded by Christopher J. Christie, an opponent. So advocates have been pushing furiously to win approval of the bill before the transfer of power on Jan. 19, and some lawmakers said the size and exuberance of the crowd of spectators at the State House was unlike anything they had seen since a fight over banning assault weapons in the early 1990s. More than 1,000 supporters and opponents converged on the Capitol on Monday, besieging lawmakers with raucous lobbying and solemn appeals to history and Scripture. The bill’s sponsor, Senator Loretta Weinberg, introduced the measure by tearfully invoking her 40-year marriage to her late husband, Irwin. Julian Bond, chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, cast the issue as the next front in the battle for racial equality and women’s rights. “Gay rights are civil rights,” Mr. Bond said, invoking during his testimony the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the women’s suffrage movement and the abolition of slavery. But opponents of the bill said same-sex marriage was an affront to religious tradition and natural law. Patrick Branigan, executive director of the New Jersey Catholic Conference , said that although Catholic teaching opposes discrimination based on sexual orientation, church leaders believe that New Jersey’s current civil union law adequately protects the rights of gay people without endangering an institution that many religions hold sacred. “Marriage is a unique natural institution, and it is always between one man and one woman,” he said. New Jersey law currently permits civil unions, but many gay rights advocates say it is a failure because it does not provide the same protections as a civil marriage, like the right to visit a partner in the hospital or to have coverage on a family insurance policy. Marsha Shapiro and Louise Walpin, a gay couple who have been together for 20 years, said that despite their civil union, they have faced job discrimination and been repeatedly denied insurance benefits. “The State of New Jersey has promised us the right to equal legal protection,” said Ms. Walpin, 58. “Our family has suffered enough. Please support us and give us the legal protection that we need.” Opponents of the measure argued that the issue was so personal that it should be put before voters in a referendum. John Tomicki, a leader of the Coalition to Preserve and Protect Marriage, said hundreds of volunteers were in Trenton to lobby against the bill and had gathered more than 300,000 signatures on petitions urging the Legislature to reject it. Six Democrats voted for the bill, along with one Republican, William Baroni of Mercer. The chairman of the committee, Paul Sarlo of Bergen, a Democrat, voted against the measure. Mr. Sarlo said he was satisfied that the committee had come to a bipartisan decision. He said that the bill still faced resistance in the Senate. “This bill still has a long, long way to go,” he said.",

    "source": "5 Charged in 9/11 Attacks Seek to Plead Guilty <eos> GUANTÁNAMO BAY , Cuba — The five Guantánamo detainees charged with coordinating the Sept. 11 attacks told a military judge on Monday that they wanted to confess in full, a move that seemed to challenge the government to put them to death. The request, which was the result of hours of private meetings among the detainees, appeared intended to undercut the government’s plan for a high-profile trial while drawing international attention to what some of the five men have said was a desire for martyrdom. But the military judge, Col. Stephen R. Henley of the Army, said a number of legal questions about how the commissions are to deal with capital cases had to be resolved before guilty pleas could be accepted. The case is likely to remain in limbo for weeks or months, presenting the Obama administration with a new issue involving detainees at the naval base at Guantánamo Bay to resolve when it takes office next month. At the start of what had been listed as routine proceedings Monday, Judge Henley said he had received a written statement from the five men dated Nov. 4 saying they planned to stop filing legal motions and “to announce our confessions to plea in full.” Speaking in what has become a familiar high-pitched tone in the cavernous courtroom here, the most prominent of the five, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , said, “we don’t want to waste our time with motions.” “All of you are paid by the U.S. government,” continued Mr. Mohammed, who has described himself as the mastermind of the 2001 attacks. “I’m not trusting any American.” Mr. Mohammed and the others presented their decision almost as a dare to the American government. When Judge Henley raised questions about the procedure for imposing the death penalty after a guilty plea, some of the detainees immediately suggested they might change their minds if they could not be assured they would be executed. The announcement Monday sent shockwaves through the biggest case in the war crimes system here — the case for which some government officials say the system was expressly devised. With the case suddenly at a critical juncture, President-elect Barack Obama may find it more complicated to carry out his pledge to close the detention camp here. Brooke Anderson, a spokeswoman for the presidential transition office, declined to comment. Military prosecutors have sought the death penalty against all five men since filing charges last February in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which killed nearly 3,000 people. Mr. Mohammed has emerged as the outspoken leader of the detainees in the courtroom and, presumably, behind closed doors. In September, Mr. Mohammed requested permission for the men — three of whom are defending themselves — to meet without lawyers to plan their defense. A military judge granted the request with the approval of the prosecution, and the men met several times for a total of 27 hours and prepared a written statement. On Monday, Judge Henley methodically questioned each man to determine if he agreed with the joint statement. One of the five detainees, Ramzi bin al-Shibh , told the judge, “We the brothers, all of us, would like to submit our confession.” Mr. bin al-Shibh is charged with being the primary contact between the operation’s organizers and the Sept. 11 hijackers. National security specialists said the strategy appeared orchestrated by Mr. Mohammed, who has repeatedly tried to turn to the legal process into an international platform. “These guys are smart enough to know that they’re not ever going to see the light of day again,” said Andrew C. McCarthy, a former federal terrorism prosecutor who is chairman of the Center for Law and Counterterrorism in Washington . “I think they’re trying to make as big a publicity splash as they can.” For the first time, the Pentagon arranged for relatives of 9/11 victims to travel to Guantánamo to attend the session. A group of them, who spoke to reporters afterward, said they were struck by the extensive rights accorded the accused men. One of the relatives, Hamilton Peterson, said he was offended by the detainees, who he said were sneering and laughing in the courtroom. “They seemed to view these proceedings as a joke,” Mr. Peterson said. In an outburst, Mr. bin al-Shibh said he wanted to congratulate Osama bin Laden , adding, “We ask him to attack the American enemy with all his power.” Some lawyers who have been following the prosecutions said the timing of the effort to plead guilty was significant, coming in what may have been the last major hearing here in the Bush administration. Mr. Obama has suggested that he might end the military commissions and charge the detainees in existing American courts. Vijay Padmanabhan, an assistant professor at Cardozo Law School who was until July a State Department lawyer with responsibility for detainee issues, said the five detainees had worked to use criticism of the military tribunals to their advantage. “They are trying to ensure their martyrdom in a manner that continues to attack the credibility of the legal system challenging them,” Mr. Padmanabhan said. In Monday’s session, which was covered by an international press corps from the Arab world, Spain , Brazil , Japan and elsewhere, Judge Henley directed prosecutors to submit full legal arguments by Jan. 4 on the procedures in capital cases outlined by the Military Commissions Act, which governs proceedings here. Among other fundamental issues, Judge Henley asked for analysis of whether the men could be sentenced to death if they pleaded guilty instead of being found guilty by a panel of military officers. Because this week’s proceedings were to consider legal motions to be decided by the judge, no panel was present. Another potential hurdle to guilty pleas was a claim by lawyers for two of the detainees that they may not be mentally competent to represent themselves. The judge ruled that those two detainees could not make decisions about their cases on Monday. The two are Mr. bin al-Shibh and Mustafa al-Hawsawi , charged as a Qaeda financial operative. In addition to Mr. Mohammed, the other detainees are Walid bin Attash , who is accused of selecting many of the hijackers, and Ammar al-Baluchi, a nephew of Mr. Mohammed who is said to have been one of his key deputies in the Sept. 11 plot. The judge said the competency issues might not be resolved for a substantial period. The three detainees who are representing themselves said they would wait to enter a plea, as Mr. Mohammed put it, “until a decision is made about our brothers.” The judge ruled that he would permit the three men who represent themselves to withdraw motions filed on their behalf, which would set the stage for a guilty plea. Human rights groups monitoring the proceedings said the judge’s uncertainty about the procedures for accepting guilty pleas in a death-penalty case here illustrated the difficulties of using a new legal system to prosecute terrorism suspects. “It is indicative about the last four years of a failed commission process,” said Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union . But a Pentagon spokesman, Cmdr. Jeffrey D. Gordon, said, “These are extraordinarily complex issues, and we have worked hard to ensure that those accused of war crimes get full and fair trials.” Alice Hoagland, the mother of Mark Bingham, who was killed on Sept. 11, said she was pleased that the military judge had not rushed to allow guilty pleas. The detainees “do not deserve to be dealt with as martyrs,” Ms. Hoagland said. “They do not deserve the glory of execution.”",

    "source": "Rise of SoundExchange Shows the Growth of Digital Radio Royalties <eos> For a sense of how quickly digital radio outlets like Pandora and SiriusXM have become a major source of revenue for the music industry, look no further than their royalty payments. SoundExchange, the nonprofit group that processes the royalties those companies and others pay to performers and record companies, took nearly a decade to pay out its first $1 billion , in 2012. The second billion came almost two years later, in early 2014. On Wednesday the organization will announce that it has crossed $3 billion in payments. “When we first started, we were a rounding error on most people’s income statements,” Michael Huppe, SoundExchange’s president, said in an interview. “Now we’re one of the top accounts at most recorded music companies.” SoundExchange, which was founded in 2000, collects money for performers and record labels whenever songs are played on digital radio. These payments — which are separate from songwriting royalties — have grown along with the popularity of online radio, and now make up a substantial part of the music industry’s revenue. The $773 million that SoundExchange paid last year is equivalent to about 16 percent of the American recording industry’s whole income of $4.9 billion, as reported by the Recording Industry Association of America. SoundExchange, which was founded as part of the recording industry association, has been independent since 2003. The bulk of the organization’s revenue comes from just two sources: Pandora and SiriusXM. But the organization collects royalties from thousands of digital radio outlets. After deducting its operating expenses, SoundExchange pays half its royalty income to the owners of recordings — typically record companies — as well as 45 percent to featured performers and 5 percent to a fund for backup singers and session musicians. According to SoundExchange, its administrative costs are equivalent to 4.6 percent of its revenues. SoundExchange is in the midst of a contentious procedure for setting Internet radio royalties that is currently before the Copyright Royalty Board, a panel of federal judges in Washington who oversee the fees it collects. SoundExchange, which represents the music industry in the proceedings, wants to raise the rate that web companies pay while Pandora, iHeartMedia and others want it reduced. According to Mr. Huppe, the difference between their proposals could amount to $4 billion to $5 billion over the five-year term being considered by the judges, which begins next year and continues through 2020. A decision by the Copyright Royalty Board is expected by December.",

    "source": "She’s Become an Expert at Accentuating the Positive <eos> Shirley Fenelon doesn’t seem like someone about to move for the third time in three years, who does not know who will care for her baby, due this month, when she goes back to work. She doesn’t sound like a woman who endured the murder of her partner, leaving her with an infant daughter, and then a separation, several years later, from the father of her younger daughter. She doesn’t appear concerned over coordinating her daughters’ school and after-school schedules with her own hectic work and school schedules, a daily crunch that often leaves all three exhausted. It is not denial that keeps her upbeat, or indifference, but a fiercely optimistic outlook on life. “I have to be positive,” she cheerfully said one afternoon in the living room of her bright two-bedroom apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn. “Something will work out.” Ms. Fenelon, 33, and her daughters, Vieysha, 14, and Infinity, 9, have been packing for their next move, in March. Their possessions are in half-empty boxes throughout the apartment. A plastic bin sits in a corner, filled with bibs, pacifiers and tiny socks. The family must move because their Section 8-subsidized apartment failed inspection — it was the exposed electrical sockets, loose window guards and poor bathroom ventilation — so her $724 monthly rent subsidy from the city was halted. Her share of the $1,275 monthly rent amounts to 30 percent of her income, or $551. Even though the city stopped the subsidy, “I always pay my portion of the rent,” Ms. Fenelon said. “I don’t care what Section 8 does.” If she did not pay, she said, “I’d have to explain to my daughters why we are on the street.” In September, the last time she moved (for the same reason as this time), Ms. Fenelon sought help from every source she could find, eventually turning to the Fifth Avenue Committee , an affordable-housing group in Brooklyn. There, her caseworker referred her to the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies , one of the seven beneficiary agencies of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund , which provided Ms. Fenelon with $1,238 for a security deposit. She hopes this coming move will be her last for a long while. She has been approved for a two-bedroom apartment in a city housing project in Canarsie, close to the Rockaways. “We’ll be next to the Canarsie pier,” Vieysha said excitedly. The journey to Canarsie began in Haiti, where Ms. Fenelon lived until she was 3, when her mother sent her to stay with an aunt in East Flatbush. Ms. Fenelon’s mother joined them five years later and the clan shared a large house on Linden Boulevard with aunts, cousins and a grandmother. A few years after Ms. Fenelon had started a family of her own, Vieysha’s father was murdered. “It was hard,” she said. “It kind of messes you up for a while. I only just accepted it; it took a long time.” Vieysha is still in contact with her paternal grandmother, and Infinity’s father is involved in her life. But the core of the family — mother, daughters, and in one month, a newborn — fends for itself. While the previous move was financed by a Neediest Cases grant, money for the current one remains elusive. But Ms. Fenelon’s attitude is upbeat, even though she does not know how she will pay for the broadcasting classes she was taking at Kingsborough Community College, or when she will be able to return to her $1,600-a-month job as a paraprofessional for the Board of Education. At Junior High School 234 in Gravesend, Ms. Fenelon focuses on students with special needs, tutoring them on everything from reading to proper manners. “I see the students really trying,” she said, “so I just give them an extra push.” Ms. Fenelon wanted to continue working until her ninth month of pregnancy, but low blood pressure and fainting spells related to it obliged her to take a health leave in November. She has applied the city for short-term disability, which would give her $250 per week. The leave ends in March, one month after she is due to give birth. Who will baby-sit once she goes back to work and school? Where will she get the money for the coming move? Ms. Fenelon is not really sure. “I don’t know how that’s going to turn out,” she said. Her eyes brightened and she smiled. “You think positive, and positive things happen. You think negative, and negative things happen.” She laughed. “You don’t lose anything by thinking positive.” How to Help Checks payable to The NewYork Times Neediest CasesFund may be sent to: 4 ChaseMetrotech Center, 7th FloorEast, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn,N.Y. 11245.

    "source": "Sarkozy, and France, Look to U.S. Visit <eos> WASHINGTON — President Nicolas Sarkozy of France travels to the United States on Monday for a two-day trip designed to underscore his close cooperation with President Barack Obama on Afghanistan, Iran and other issues, and apparently to make a statement about their personal relationship. The trip, culminating in a news conference Tuesday and then a private dinner at the White House, comes at a crucial time for both. Mr. Obama has just scored two major victories — the passage of historic health-care legislation and agreement with Russia on a new strategic arms control treaty — and is heading into a period of heavy international engagement. Mr. Sarkozy, for his part, has seen his popularity fade and his party suffer stinging defeats in regional elections. At the same time he is preparing for a crucial stint on the world stage as France takes leadership of both the Group of Eight and the Group of Twenty. As the newspaper Le Parisien put it, “This meeting could not come at a better time” for Mr. Sarkozy. The closeness of the Sarkozy-Obama relationship — and for that matter, of Mr. Obama with other European leaders — has been questioned, based on issues like Mr. Obama’s decision in February to skip an annual U.S.-European summit meeting. But in an interview here last week with the International Herald Tribune and three French correspondents, the national security adviser, James L. Jones Jr., repeatedly rejected the notion of any strains. He called Mr. Sarkozy a “very helpful and steadfast ally” on Iran and “a strong adviser and supporter on the Middle East.” If Mr. Sarkozy sometimes urges the American president to push harder in both areas, said the general, Mr. Obama appreciated the “honest exchange of views.” General Jones, a former supreme allied commander in Europe, said that Mr. Obama had particularly appreciated Mr. Sarkozy’s decision to bring France back into NATO’s military wing and Paris’s “strong support” on Afghanistan. The United States has been pressing its NATO allies to provide more military trainers for Afghanistan. French officials have been quoted as saying they will send no more, but General Jones appeared to leave open the possibility that Mr. Sarkozy would make such a gesture during the visit. While the general acknowledged that as NATO commander he had known frustration over allied contributions in Afghanistan, he said that he had never seen better cooperation within NATO. “We’ve achieved a major breakthrough in how we think of Afghanistan and Pakistan,” he said, “and there is a new sense of energy that we can be successful.” He played down two areas of friction. The announcement that France had agreed to sell four Mistral-class warships to Russia might once have raised American hackles. But General Jones seemed unperturbed. “It was not the subject of any serious bone of contention,” he said, adding that the United States, too, wanted better relations with Moscow. Europeans were deeply unhappy when the Pentagon, while taking bids for a huge contract to supply aerial refueling tankers, changed the plane’s specifications in a way they interpreted as giving an advantage to the chief American bidder, Boeing, to the detriment of the European aerospace group EADS. General Jones asserted that as a former director of Boeing he could not comment. But he said that Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates had “assured the president that the Department of Defense wants the competition to be fair and equal for all parties.” The presidents also are expected to discuss some differences: France wants the United States to institute tougher financial regulations and to undertake more resolute action on climate change. Mr. Sarkozy is to open his trip with a speech Monday at Columbia University in New York. He then is to meet with the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. In Washington on Tuesday, he plans to meet with several senators before the presidents hold a late-afternoon news conference. They are then to adjourn, with Michelle Obama and Carla Sarkozy, for a private dinner that French officials are calling “testimony to a particularly close friendship.”",

    "source": "Peacekeepers in Golan Abducted but Released <eos> UNITED NATIONS — Armed men broke into a United Nations outpost in a buffer zone separating Israel and Syria in the disputed Golan Heights region and abducted three military observers, the peacekeeping chief said on Thursday. Hervé Ladsous, the head of United Nations peacekeeping operations, told reporters that Syrian men held the unarmed observers for about five hours and released them unharmed Wednesday morning. It was the third abduction of peacekeepers in the tense region since March and underlined their vulnerability in the spillover of the conflict in Syria, which is now in its third year. Mr. Ladsous called the latest abduction “a very serious incident ... that illustrates the very difficult conditions that now prevail” in and around the area separating Syrian and Israeli forces, which is supposed to be free of armed groups. The Security Council strongly condemned the abduction by “a group of antigovernment armed elements,” who also looted the observation post. In a statement Thursday evening, the Council called on all Syrian parties to cooperate with peacekeepers, to ensure their security and to enable them to operate freely. The buffer zone had been largely quiet for four decades, but tensions have increased as the conflict in Syria has escalated. One result is that several countries that contribute troops to the observer force have pulled out their soldiers.",

    "source": "Park Lovers Fight N.Y.U.-Greenwich Village Journal <eos> All together, the seven strips of greenery hardly seem substantial enough to amount to a park. Someone unfamiliar with Greenwich Village might pass them by as ornamental to their adjoining buildings, like extra-wide hedges. But to many residents in and around the two sprawling apartment complexes owned by New York University , these oblong borders of grass, trees and paved playground are precious parkland, spots to sit under an oak’s shade, savor bird song, teach a child to skate, or cultivate roses. “They have been part of our backyard and our front yard,” said Dr. Allan Horland, an internist who has lived in one complex, Washington Square Village, for 40 years. The strips, which add up to 2 ½ acres, are owned by the city but have become the latest battleground in the long-running dispute between residents who want to maintain their offbeat neighborhood’s character and a university that says it needs to grow if it is to attract top students and faculty members. In three decades, N.Y.U. has transformed itself from a commuter school to a national institution with an undergraduate and graduate enrollment of 42,000. Over the next two decades, N.Y.U. wants to build six million square feet of dormitories and classrooms in Manhattan, Downtown Brooklyn and Governors Island, with half — approximately the floor space of the Empire Square Building — in its Greenwich Village core. Four new buildings would be put within the two housing complexes, and to acquire enough space to realize that plan, N.Y.U. wants to buy from the city’s Department of Transportation four of the seven strips edging the complexes. N.Y.U. promises to make good for any parkland it levels by opening an equivalent amount of publicly accessible parklike grounds inside the complexes. But neighbors are skeptical and would like all seven strips turned over to the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation to become parkland. A rally Dec. 5 to make that point drew 125 people, and opponents of N.Y.U.’s plan have received the support of the local community board. “Two and half acres is a lot for a park-starved community,” said Terri Cude, a co-chairwoman of the preservationist Community Action Alliance on N.Y.U. The two modernistic complexes, built in the 1950s and 1960s, are outliers in the Village landscape of brownstones and loft buildings. They rise imposingly on two so-called superblocks north of Houston Street and include three honeycombed towers designed by the I. M. Pei firm, two of which are a landmark known as Silver Towers, and the four buildings of Washington Square Village. The two complexes, home to 1,700 families, are built around landscaped courtyards, with Silver Towers graced by a 36-foot sculpture that was designed in partnership with Picasso. Champions of preserving all seven strips argue that any compensatory green space that N.Y.U. would create would be used mostly by residents of the housing complexes, since the two complexes can appear like gated communities to outsiders. N.Y.U. officials respond that one benefit of rethinking the complexes’ open space is to make the courtyards more inviting. “Right now if you’re Joe Q. Public, you feel like you can’t walk through the block,” acknowledged Alicia D. Hurley, vice president for government and community affairs. For years now, New York University has sometimes been seen as the neighborhood’s bully, gobbling up lot after lot and spoiling the Village’s quaint, low-rise bohemian character. N.Y.U. contends that its campus is far more squeezed for space than other universities. It says it has just 160 academic square feet per student compared with 326 at Columbia University and 673 at Harvard. (Columbia is undertaking a controversial 17-building expansion in West Harlem.) John Beckman, a spokesman for the university, said the Village offers little room to grow beyond the open spaces inside the two superblocks. In November, N.Y.U. scrapped plans to add a 38-story tower to the Silver Towers complex after I. M. Pei himself made his opposition known. In its place, the university wants to erect a 17-story building nearby on the site of the Morton Williams supermarket on La Guardia Place, a site the university owns outright. The new building would not require the taking of a La Guardia Place green strip. But some residents are objecting that it would ruin the strip’s best feature by casting a deep shadow on a community garden, one where 50 local gardeners grow apples, roses and lavender. Plans for three other buildings — a dormitory for 1,400 students atop what now houses the Jerome S. Coles Sports Center and two boomerang-shaped academic buildings that would flank the courtyard of Washington Square Village — would swallow up three additional strips. Jo Hamilton, chairwoman of Community Board Two in Manhattan, said that losing the strips would especially hurt because her district’s neighborhoods have just 0.4 acres of parkland for every thousand residents compared with a citywide average 2.5 acres. Each of the seven strips bordering the complexes “has a different personality,” said Ms. Cude as she gave a reporter a tour. Along La Guardia Place, part of the strip is known as Time Landscape for relatively old red cedars, beech and slippery elm. A strip farther north on La Guardia Place has a statue of the mayor for whom the street was named and will soon get a toddlers’ playground. A strip along Bleecker Street is graced by seven cherry trees. A strip along Mercer Street has a heavily used dog run. N.Y.U. plans to move the dog run inside the Silver Towers complex and create new interior playgrounds to replace any it bulldozes. Still, the existing exterior strips have their ardent devotees. Dr. Horland recalled how he taught his son Jeremy, now 40, to ride a bike in a Mercer Street playground and noted how he now took Jeremy’s son, Elijah, 5, there. Dr. Hurley says she thinks that once tempers subside, the university and its neighbors will have to come together to figure out how any new public spaces “can work for everybody.” “We have a lot of work to convince people of that,” she said.",

    "source": "Now a Lobbyist, an Ex-Senator Uses Campaign Money <eos> When he was last running for the United States Senate from New Jersey in 2002, Robert G. Torricelli collected donations from thousands of people who apparently wanted to see him re-elected. They might be surprised to see how he spent a portion of their money. Mr. Torricelli, a Democrat who was one of the Senate’s most flamboyant personalities and prodigious fund-raisers, abruptly quit the 2002 race amid allegations of ethical misconduct and became a lobbyist. Since then, he has given $4,000 from his campaign fund to Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member of Congress, $10,000 to Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois and more than $40,000 to Nevada Democratic Party organizations and candidates linked to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid. All of those politicians had one thing in common: influence over Mr. Torricelli’s, or his clients’, business interests. In early 2006, for instance, Mr. Torricelli contributed $10,000 from his Senate account to the mayor of Trenton and his slate of City Council candidates, just as city agencies were reviewing an ultimately successful proposal by the former senator to develop retail and office space in the city. There is no evidence that Mr. Torricelli, who declined to be interviewed for this article, violated federal rules, which allow retired officials to give leftover campaign funds to charities, candidates and political parties. Sean Jackson, Mr. Torricelli’s campaign treasurer and a partner in his lobbying firm, said in an interview that any suggestion that the contributions were tied to his business interests was “ridiculous.” He said that Mr. Torricelli contributed to people he knew or with whom he shared policy goals. “Bob has supported people who he believes in, and he doesn’t regret doing it,” Mr. Jackson said. Mr. Torricelli had more campaign money, $2.9 million, than any other senator who has retired in the last 20 years, except John Edwards, who is running for president, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog group. In all, he has spent almost $900,000 from his account since leaving Congress, much of it on gifts to charities and nonprofit organizations like hospitals as well as political campaigns and parties. At least $65,000 went to politicians, or organizations linked to them, that had influence over business interests of Mr. Torricelli or his clients. Campaign finance watchdogs say Mr. Torricelli’s spending raises questions about federal regulations dictating how former politicians can spend unused campaign contributions. The rules prohibit former officials from using their leftover campaign money for personal expenses. And although Mr. Torricelli has not done that, campaign finance watchdogs say he seems to have found a legal wrinkle to spend those funds in ways that could buttress his private business. His case, they say, underscores the need to tighten the rules. Massie Ritsch of the Center for Responsive Politics, said Mr. Torricelli could have considered giving the money back to donors or to charity. “Contributors should reasonably expect that their money will go for campaigning and not that it will sit in an account for years and be doled out to build someone’s personal business,” he said. A day after being asked about Mr. Torricelli’s spending from his Senate account, Mr. Jackson called The New York Times to say that the bulk of the remaining money would go to a foundation that Mr. Torricelli had established earlier this year to help causes like breast cancer awareness and open space preservation. Mr. Torricelli quit the 2002 race in October of that year, several weeks after the Senate Ethics Committee issued a letter “severely admonishing” him for accepting three gifts from a contributor, David Chang. Two months after leaving the race, Mr. Torricelli founded a lobbying practice, Rosemont Associates, which now has clients including the government of Taiwan and the owner of Cablevision. The business has taken him far beyond New Jersey. In February 2005, Aveta Holdings L.L.C., of Hackensack, which provides managed care to Medicare recipients in Puerto Rico and other places, hired his firm for $10,000 a month as it was moving to acquire a managed care company that served Medicare recipients on the island, according to a copy of his contract. He was to build support for the company and meet with political leaders on its behalf. In May 2006, Mr. Torricelli made two contributions totaling $4,000 from his Senate campaign account to Luis G. Fortuno, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member of Congress. Three weeks later, executives with Aveta Holdings and their relatives made donations of $12,000 to Mr. Fortuno’s campaign committee. Mr. Fortuno’s office said that he advocated an approach that would foster competition in the Medicare program by allowing more companies to participate. Federal regulators eventually adopted such an approach, the office said. Mr. Torricelli, in turn, dropped in on Mr. Fortuno this year to thank him for his efforts, according to a person familiar with the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. Mr. Jackson said that Mr. Torricelli’s donations to Mr. Fortuno had nothing to do with Aveta, and were made because he, like Mr. Fortuno, has long supported Puerto Rican statehood. Contributors to Mr. Fortuno connected to Aveta did not return phone calls to their offices and homes. Aveta’s chairman, Daniel E. Straus, also declined to comment. Mr. Torricelli has also tapped his campaign account to make sizable donations to Nevada politicians, including several Democrats close to Senator Reid. In 2003, $25,000 from the Torricelli for U.S. Senate account was given to Silver State Victory 2004, the committee coordinating the Democratic effort in Nevada that year. Then in October 2004, he gave $10,000 to the Nevada State Democratic Party, of which Mr. Reid is the titular head. The same month Mr. Torricelli also gave $250 to Josh Reid, the senator’s son, who ran unsuccessfully for a City Council seat in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. Shortly afterward, Mr. Torricelli began reaching out to Mr. Reid on behalf of a client that retained him for $15,000 a month: the government of Taiwan. On Feb. 2, 2005, before contacting any other senator, Mr. Torricelli called Mr. Reid to set up a meeting with Taiwan’s representative in the United States, according to federal lobbying records, to discuss Taiwan’s opposition to a new Chinese law that authorized the use of force if Taiwan declared independence. By February 2007, Mr. Torricelli had contacted Mr. Reid or his staff some two dozen times about Taiwan’s interests, going beyond what he did with other Democratic Senators, the records show. A spokesman for Mr. Reid said that it was unfair to single out the donations that Mr. Torricelli made in Nevada, given that the state was drawing significant attention from Democrats around the country who viewed its role as crucially important in the presidential election. Mr. Jackson said Mr. Torricelli’s donations to Mr. Reid stemmed from their long relationship, not his lobbying on Taiwan. “It would be surprising — it would be amazing — if he didn’t support Harry Reid,” Mr. Jackson said. Money has gone elsewhere. On Oct. 29, 2003, Governor Blagojevich of Illinois made a fund-raising trip to New York and had a private meeting with Mr. Torricelli and Leonard Barrack, whose law firm, Barrack, Rodos & Bacine, had hired the former senator as a consultant, according to an article in the Chicago Sun-Times. Five days after the meeting, Mr. Torricelli and the firm itself each gave $10,000 to Mr. Blagojevich’s reelection campaign account, according to campaign disclosure reports. (Mr. Torricelli drew on his Senate campaign account for his donation.) On Feb. 20, 2004, the law firm was placed on the Illinois State Teachers Retirement System’s list of preferred outside attorneys, according to a spokeswoman for the state fund. The retirement system’s board of trustees decides who is placed on that list, not the governor. But the governor appoints 4 of the 11 members of the board. A spokeswoman for Mr. Blagojevich said that the governor’s office was unable to comment on the meeting because she did not have access to the governor’s campaign schedule and it appeared to be part of a campaign-related trip. Mr. Jackson said that Mr. Torricelli does not recall meeting Mr. Blagojevich. As a lobbyist in Trenton, Mr. Torricelli counted his biggest client in 2006 as CSC Holdings, the operator of Cablevision, which paid him $162,000 that year. In early 2006, Mr. Torricelli’s firm was lobbying state regulators to seek changes in a bill sponsored by State Senator Joseph V. Doria Jr., a Democrat, that would have allowed telephone companies like Verizon, a chief rival of Cablevision’s, to provide pay television service. In May, Mr. Torricelli contributed $5,000 from his Senate campaign account to a slate of municipal candidates headed by Mr. Doria, who is also the mayor of Bayonne. Eventually, the bill passed, but Cablevision succeeded in weakening some provisions, according to lobbyists in Trenton. Mr. Doria did not return a call last week seeking more information about the law. Mr. Jackson said that Mr. Torricelli has supported Mr. Doria for years. Mr. Torricelli has also given contributions from his campaign account as he has pursued real estate deals in his home state. In September 2005, Mr. Torricelli purchased the Golden Swan, a boarded-up historic building situated a couple of blocks from the State House in Trenton, for $1 from the City of Trenton, according to real estate records. Mr. Torricelli and Trenton’s mayor, Douglas H. Palmer, were signatories. Mr. Torricelli then began investing at least $3 million in restoring the building. But he needed city approvals. In the spring of 2006, Mr. Torricelli contributed $10,000 from his Senate campaign account to Mr. Palmer, and his slate of City Council candidates for the June municipal election. Those donations came as city agencies, including the Council, were reviewing Mr. Torricelli’s proposal for the Golden Swan, which called for the creation of retail and office space in the building. That fall, the Council, including Mr. Palmer’s slate, gave Mr. Torricelli an $89,000 grant to install an elevator in another building he was developing in Trenton’s downtown. This March, the Council also approved a state loan application for the Golden Swan. “It’s not like if you give me money, you’re going to get stuff — it doesn’t work like that,” Mr. Palmer said. Mr. Jackson said: “If anything, Torricelli did something to help people and the city.”",

    "source": "Raghuram Rajan, India’s Departing Central Banker, Has a New Warning <eos> MUMBAI, India — Three years before the 2008 global financial crisis, an Indian economist named Raghuram G. Rajan presciently warned a skeptical audience of top economic thinkers that excessive risk threatened the entire global financial system. As Mr. Rajan stepped down on Sunday as India’s top central banker, following intense criticism at home, he offered a new warning: Low interest rates globally could distort markets and would be difficult to abandon. Countries around the world, including the United States and Europe, have kept interest rates low as a way to encourage growth. But countries could become “trapped” by fear that when they eventually raised rates, they “would see growth slow down,” he said. Low interest rates should not be a substitute for “other instruments of policy” and “various kinds of reforms” that are needed to encourage growth, Mr. Rajan said in a recent interview with The New York Times. “Often when monetary policy is really easy, it becomes the residual policy of choice,” he said, when deeper reforms are needed. His warning comes at a time when the world’s central banks appear to be at a loss about how to get global growth moving again. A growing number of voices say that low rates are not doing the job and that governments must take other, more politically difficult steps to reinvigorate growth. The warning by Mr. Rajan, now 53, came as he stepped down from a position that had helped make him something of a rock star — albeit a controversial one — in India. He disputed the view that his tight monetary policies had cost him the support of the government, and he said that his departure was based on his inability to reach an agreement with the government on serving longer but not serving another full three-year term. Mr. Rajan is a celebrity in a country where taxi drivers and vegetable sellers are as likely as business owners and bankers to be immersed in debate on the local economy. A blunt speaker who has laid out the case for tighter monetary policies in more than 30 public speeches over the last three years, he was called “the Ranbir Kapoor of banking,” a reference to a Bollywood superstar, by one of the country’s longest-running columnists. Mr. Rajan, whose term expired on Sunday, is credited with helping stabilize the Indian economy. It was fighting double-digit inflation, a weakening of its currency and a plunging stock market when he took the job in 2013. But he also leaves bruised after a barrage of public attacks from the political base of conservatives and small-business interests of India’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party. They complained that he choked business by keeping interest rates high and requiring banks to clean up bad debts, which made credit expensive and hard to come by. The attacks turned vicious and personal in the weeks before Mr. Rajan announced in June that he would not continue for a second term, with a B.J.P. lawmaker declaring that Mr. Rajan was “mentally not fully Indian,” in part because he holds a United States green card, allowing him to work and live there. Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, later denounced the attacks, but only after Mr. Rajan said he was leaving the job. With Mr. Modi preparing for contentious local elections, some observers have said the government did not want Mr. Rajan to stay because it needed a looser monetary policy to bolster growth. India has the fastest-growing large economy in the world, at an annual rate of 7.1 percent for the most recent quarter, but that is still far slower than the rate of a decade ago and not fast enough to create jobs for the more than one million people who enter the work force each month. Mr. Modi won election in 2014 promising economic growth and jobs. Mr. Rajan, leaning back in his chair and laughing at times during the interview, disputed that claim. “I don’t think it’s fair to say that it’s because of tight policy that the government wanted to move on,” he said. He cited the government’s move after he announced his departure to set a low inflation target of 4 percent for the next five years. He said his successor, Urjit Patel, a central bank deputy governor who takes over this week, played an important role in setting the country’s tough inflation targets. Mr. Modi has said little in public about Mr. Rajan’s departure except to defend him as “someone who loves his country” and “will continue to serve it.” Mr. Modi’s spokesman declined in a telephone interview on Sunday to explain why Mr. Rajan was leaving, other than to say: “There is a tenure and the tenure has ended. Why should the prime minister of India even be brought into this discussion?” Mr. Rajan said his tight monetary policy had helped bring India’s rate of inflation — currently about 6 percent — down to the upper end of the government’s target range. “I think we’ve done exactly what was needed,” he said. Mr. Rajan said the central bank should continue to prioritize low inflation. He said he hoped the country would finish “the process of bank cleanup which is underway.” Under Mr. Rajan, India’s banks, after decades of loose lending to corporations , had to own up to bad debts. The restriction was intended to shore up the long-term stability of banks, but in the short term it has reduced the pace of lending to businesses. In discussing the Indian economy in the interview, Mr. Rajan offered a less-than-ringing endorsement of the government’s emphasis on manufacturing in India — what the prime minister has called his Make in India campaign. Mr. Rajan said he did not support the view of critics that it was too late in world economic history for India to become a manufacturing hub. But he also said that he would not focus exclusively on manufacturing as the solution to joblessness. If India improves infrastructure and reduces government regulations, manufacturing might take off in a big way, but it “could also be services. It could be value-added agriculture also.” Although China’s economy has overshadowed India’s in recent decades, Mr. Rajan said he was still a believer in democracy as the better system to create long-term growth. “India’s strengths to some extent comes also from its democracy,” he said. “Things can get bad in India, but not beyond a certain point, because the democratic process asserts itself. And we have a change in government.” Mr. Rajan, who served as chief economist of the International Monetary Fund from 2003 to 2006, will return to his longtime job as a professor at the University of Chicago’s business school. He grew momentarily wistful when comparing the job of central bank governor with his past positions, which were more advisory. “So better to be a doer than an adviser. Of course being an adviser sometimes has effects, important effects, but you don’t see it as much immediately. Here you can see what you’re doing and in the years to come.”",

    "source": "At X Games, One-Upmanship Is a Trend in High Places <eos> ASPEN, Colo. — Four years ago, the snowboarder Travis Rice was riding in Utah’s Wasatch Mountains when he accidentally invented the double cork, one of the more progressive and talked-about tricks in snowboarding recently. Rice was attempting a frontside 900 — two and a half rotations — and became too corked, or off-axis, while soaring 90 feet through the air at a place called the Pyramid Gap. Rice landed an “extremely sketchy version of the double cork,” he said. As it happened, Rice had furthered the progression of snowboarding tricks by chance. But most often tricks evolve out of necessity, as riders are constantly trying to outdo one another in what amounts to the sport’s equivalent of a cold war arms race. “It’s a game of one-upmanship,” said Mike Jankowski, freestyle coach for the United States snowboard team. “It’s been this way for years and years in snowboarding.” The same is true in freeskiing, in which skiers pull tricks on some of the same terrain as snowboarders. Often next-generation tricks are pioneered on large, straight jumps that launch riders dozens of feet through the air. At the Winter X Games this year, which take place this week at Buttermilk Mountain in Aspen, there will be a massive jump for a new event in skiing and snowboarding called big air. Skiers, who compete Friday, and snowboarders, who compete Saturday, will face off in a head-to-head format with their best moves while soaring from a 65-foot jump. Winners will be determined by voting from a combination of judges and fans. The better moves could eventually make their way into a halfpipe routine and, in the case of snowboarding, be part of a winning run at the Olympics in 2010. “Tricks are definitely being progressed almost on a daily basis,” said Steve Fisher, who won gold in halfpipe at the X Games in 2007. “There’s always a drive to do the next 180 or a double cork, or something like that. And the double cork is really big off the straight jumps right now.” Although no one has performed the double cork, an off-axis spin, in a halfpipe, “that is probably going to be the next step,” Fisher said. Kevin Pearce, who will compete in big air and halfpipe at the X Games, said, “For me it’s hard to learn new tricks in the half, especially now that the level is so high for the tricks that you have to be learning.” Pearce added: “I think it’s a lot easier on the jumps because if you fall, it’s not as big of a consequence. I’ve definitely learned a lot of tricks on jumps and been like, ‘Oh, I could try that in the halfpipe.’ ” For snowboard big air, Pearce has been working on a cab 1260, in which he takes off backward, or switch-stance, and spins three and a half rotations before landing. But days before the X Games, he had not yet learned the double cork. Two years after Rice first landed the move, he unveiled the double cork in competition, winning two events. For a time it was the most extreme trick in snowboarding. Although there are still many riders who cannot land one, by 2007 the double cork had been surpassed. In the best trick event — a precursor to big air — at the X Games last year, Rice settled for silver when Andreas Wiig landed a frontside 1080-degree spin (three rotations) to win gold. But in the meantime, Rice has raised the stakes. At the Icer Air event in San Francisco in November, he landed the winning run with a double backside rodeo 1080-spin, spinning while inverted. “It’s a heavy trick,” Rice said. In skiing, tricks often progress according to the same principles as snowboarding. “Somebody will get the guts to try a new trick and other people will see that it’s possible,” the freeskier Peter Olenick said. “Then they’ll try it and figure out how they can do it or they can do it better.” Two years ago, Jon Olsson pioneered double flips — off-axis double back flips — on large jumps. Last year, Olenick transferred double flips to halfpipe, calling his version the whiskey flip, which helped him win bronze in the event at the X Games. “I’m sure this year there’s going to be a bunch of people doing the one I did last year or trying new ones,” Olenick said. “We all just kind of feed off each other.” For Olsson, a progressive freeskier who has won eight X Games medals and will compete in big air, the challenge is to remain ahead of the pack. “I spend half a year on a new trick, while someone watches a video and sees, ‘Oh that’s possible; I’ll go out and learn it,’ ” he said. “They’ll learn it in a week.” Olsson has learned new variations of double flips for big air this year, but, he said, “people are catching up fast.” Some skiers have landed 1660-degree spins (four and a half rotations), although without the necessary stylish grab to win a competition. But Olsson believes that the day is not far off when the trick will be performed with flair. “Two years ago I would have said a double flip with a cool grab would be impossible,” Olsson said. “But things progress so fast. One year you think something is impossible and the next year everyone is doing it.”",

    "source": "A Precarious Olympic Bid for Istanbul <eos> ISTANBUL — There were hundreds of pairs of swim goggles for sale in the heart of Istanbul this past week, but while the goggles gave the bustling streets a certain sporty air, this was not good news at last for the city’s Olympic bid. The goggles were being snapped up for protection against the possibility of more tear gas in Taksim Square and the adjoining Gezi Park as the standoff between protesters and the Turkish police continued. Other gear for sale in the zone included plastic construction helmets, gas masks, surgical masks and all manner of souvenirs, like figurines of Turkey’s founder, Kemal Ataturk, and Che Guevara and Occupy Taksim T-shirts. The mood was unexpectedly upbeat on Thursday. There was an ad hoc evening piano concert in the square, and the only serious smoke was from roasting chestnuts and kebabs. But the timing of all this has hardly been a Turkish delight for those who hope Istanbul’s fifth bid for the Olympic Games will finally be the winning bid. Tokyo and Madrid are the other candidates. “It is potentially a pity, since my impression, from what I hear, is that the 2020 race may be Istanbul’s to lose,” said Dick Pound, the longtime International Olympic Committee member from Canada, in an e-mail message. Istanbul, if stable, is indeed potential catnip to the I.O.C. It is new and symbolic Olympic territory, a historic and contemporary bridge between Asia and Europe with a largely Muslim nation and a moderately Islamist government, challenging Turkey’s secular traditions. Pound is not yet picking his favorite publicly, but the I.O.C. will do just that on Sept. 7 when it selects the 2020 host city by secret ballot in Buenos Aires. The vote is still nearly three months away, which means there is still time for Istanbul to put some meaningful space between the past week’s violent clashes in Taksim Square and the decision. As Pound rightly points out, “We might have the same concerns in any country that hosts the G-8 or G-20 conferences, and the seemingly mandatory riots.” But as Pound also points out, “the Western phobia about Islamic countries and ‘stability’ — however defined — makes it much worse.” But damage has clearly been done already. “I believe in the young people of Turkey; I believe so much,” Hasan Arat, the chairman of Istanbul’s bidding committee, said in a telephone interview from Lausanne, Switzerland. “We will be stronger than before after these things finish with the peaceful solution.” That naturally remains debatable. But the situation does indeed need to be resolved — presumably peacefully — if the I.O.C. is not to lose much more faith in the judgment of Turkey’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the country’s political leadership. “It’s going to be quite a roller-coaster ride for everybody involved in the bid up until September,” said Michael Payne, the former I.O.C. marketing director who is now a consultant and, on occasion, an informal bid adviser. Pound said, “I agree that September is some time in the future, but there will have to be some acceptable resolution of the situation that involves engaging with those who are not simply visiting anarchists.” A visit to Gezi Park and its hundreds of tents made the breadth of the movement clear. There was everything from tap-dancing to card-playing under the trees on Thursday; even people browsing through a uniquely independent bookstore that had been set up under a canopy with cinder blocks and planks providing the bookshelves. There was a range of ages and socioeconomic classes in evidence. Some of the park’s occupants on Thursday looked like they might actually spend their lives in tents; others looked like they might be more at home in the tented camps of southern Africa, sundowners and dinner jackets de rigueur. Image On Monday, protesters were gathered at Gezi Park. Credit Thanassis Stavrakis/Associated Press But what was clear, in conversations behind the smoldering truck tires and the barricades of overturned cars, is that this will now be a very tricky situation to defuse and forget. The Olympics are hardly at the forefront of the debate, with the focus, above all, on preserving the park, a rare stretch of green in central Istanbul, from redevelopment. “We don’t care about Olympics too much; we just want our freedom,” said one 21-year-old university student who declined to give his name for fear of reprisal from the government. “We want to save the environment; we want to save the green,” he continued. “They are destroying everything around the city, not only here in this park in Istanbul. All Turkey.” Asked if he was aware these protests could negatively affect the city’s Olympic bid, the student nodded. “Of course we are concerned about that, but we don’t harm anybody,” he said, gesturing to his friend. “We don’t even harm the police. We just sit here and hope this place is going to be saved for two years, three years maybe. This is our Central Park. “If they give the Olympics to Istanbul, it’s good of course for us, but I don’t think they will give it to Istanbul. Because there is really heavy traffic in Istanbul, and we can’t even handle that. How can we do it in Olympics?” The traffic is indeed brutal in this city by the Bosporus. The combined budget of $19 billion for Olympic costs and the city’s own infrastructure projects looks a bit daunting, too. But logistical challenges at this stage must be starting to look like child’s play to the bid leadership compared with the sociopolitical challenges that the Taksim Square demonstrations have laid bare. Arat, the bid leader, a former professional basketball player turned businessman, said that he was concerned by the situation but that there was a positive side to the protests. He plans to explain that when he and the rest of the Istanbul bid team (politicians not present) make their presentation along with the Tokyo and Madrid groups to more than 200 national Olympic committees on Saturday in Lausanne. “Yes, I’m worried,” Arat said of the protest’s repercussions. “But if we explain well how this thing starts and for what reason it starts, then people can appreciate that as well. It’s very good that your country’s young people are caring about their country and environmental issues, and I’m proud of them, very proud of them, honestly speaking, because when they care about their country, they care about their future.” Arat said he was not referring to those violent protesters he believed had corrupted the spirit of the movement. “Not the other people who are trying to hijack these fantastic feelings,” he said. Lower-key until now, this 2020 vote has become suddenly much more intriguing. If Turkey remains in an unsettled state, the I.O.C. will once again have to decide between a riskier choice that could generate societal change and safer options in Madrid and, above all, Tokyo that would reward stability. That may be a shade too simplistic. Madrid, as Spain’s capital, represents a nation that is struggling economically. It also has a reputation — deserved or undeserved — as a paradise for sports doping. Spain could use a little societal change about now, too, and its government made a concerted attempt to address potential I.O.C. concerns by passing a new anti-doping law this past week. As for Tokyo, it represents the latest Japanese renaissance, this one after the huge earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts of the country’s east coast in March 2011. The Tokyo bid has not played that card. Nor does it plan to do so, but there clearly would be a greater mission to bringing the Games back to Tokyo, too. They were staged there in 1964 and were staged in Spain in Barcelona, home city of the former I.O.C. president Juan Antonio Samaranch, in 1992. Therein lies one of Istanbul’s big advantages. Turkey has never staged the Olympics, and Istanbul, with nearly 14 million inhabitants, is the largest city in Europe (or at least partly in Europe). Unlike Madrid and Tokyo, it has a fast-growing economy. The Games also have not been staged in a country with a Muslim majority. But all that catnip may not be sufficient if Erdogan remains tone deaf and something very nasty happens in Gezi Park. It was brimming with youthful enthusiasm on Thursday, which also made it feel like the sort of place that could break your heart. “Be careful, get a helmet,” the 21-year-old student suggested as we parted ways near a pile of rubble. “Maybe the police come tonight.”",

    "source": "Diamondbacks Have Used New Attitude and New Bullpen to Lead N.L. West <eos> PHILADELPHIA — With two out in the ninth inning Tuesday night, Gerardo Parra broke for second on a stolen-base attempt for the Arizona Diamondbacks . From his seat in the third-base dugout, Ian Kennedy distinctly heard Ryan Howard, the Philadelphia Phillies’ first baseman, shout, “Runner!” to alert the other fielders. Kennedy was startled. Just moments before, more than 45,000 people at Citizens Bank Park had been standing and stomping as Roy Halladay, the best pitcher in the league, tried to finish his latest masterpiece. But the Diamondbacks had wrested the lead, silencing the caldron in South Philly. It was eerie, Kennedy said, to see such a lively atmosphere turn so suddenly, emphatically, dead. “We’re not scared of anybody,” said Justin Upton, the Diamondbacks’ right fielder, who started the rally and leads the National League in total bases entering Wednesday. “I don’t think we’ve backed down from one team this year. The last few years, we haven’t won a big game. We always lost the close games. We just didn’t have any fight, it didn’t seem. But this is a different team, different character to it.” In his first full season managing the Diamondbacks, Kirk Gibson has imparted a grinder’s mentality to a team that shuffled to 97 losses last season. The Diamondbacks have a two-and-a-half-game edge over the San Francisco Giants in the National League West , and their 35 comeback victories led the majors. It is a swift turnaround for a team that made a miserable first impression last season on its new general manager, Kevin Towers. The Diamondbacks he inherited, Towers said this spring, carried themselves like losers. Gibson vowed change, and when he recruited the free-agent closer J. J. Putz, he promised to improve the culture and win. “We play the game the way they used to play the game,” said Putz, who grew up in Michigan watching Gibson play for the Detroit Tigers. “We’re really starting to take the mold of our coaching staff.” By the end of spring training, Upton said, players were smashing bats on the dugout rack and flinging helmets after bad at-bats. Kennedy said he did not know if the team would be better, but he knew things would be different. Part of it was the fire of Gibson and his coaches, who challenge each other in the weight room. Their competitiveness, Kennedy said, was bound to trickle down. But there is a more tangible reason the team is so much better. “We don’t have the same team as we did last year,” Kennedy said. “The major difference is having J. J. and David Hernandez at the end of our bullpen.” Towers tackled two problems at once last winter by trading third baseman Mark Reynolds to Baltimore in a deal for Hernandez. The Diamondbacks set a major league record for strikeouts last season, with Reynolds leading the majors for the third season in a row. The Diamondbacks have not missed Reynolds’s power — they lead the league in extra-base hits — and Hernandez has been dominant. Hernandez has held opponents to a .169 average and earned seven saves while Putz was on the disabled list in July. Putz has 30 saves, regaining the form that once made him so enticing to the Mets. The Diamondbacks’ bullpen has a 3.77 earned run average , nearly two runs better than last season’s 5.74. Kennedy has been among its biggest beneficiaries. He is 15-3, winning his last seven starts despite only once working more than seven innings. He struggled to explain his improvement, mainly because he has not been much better than last season, when he was 9-10 but very unlucky. Kennedy actually had a better E.R.A. in his no-decisions than he did in his victories last season, meaning erratic run support and woeful relief cost him dearly. “If you look at this year and last year, I really can’t tell you there’s much different,” said Kennedy, a former Yankee who was dealt in the Curtis Granderson trade. “I know the wins come from our bullpen, really. I feel very comfortable handing the ball over, if I go seven, to David and J. J. Just like back in New York, with Mariano, if you have just one setup guy, it makes the game so much shorter.” Daniel Hudson, Joe Saunders and Josh Collmenter have been solid behind Kennedy, and while the hitters still strike out a lot, they no longer lead the league in whiffs. There is power all through the lineup — the rookie Paul Goldschmidt ripped a two-run homer off Cliff Lee in a 9-2 loss on Wednesday — and the well-rounded Upton could be a contender for the N.L. Most Valuable Player award. Upton, who turns 24 next week , was part of the 2007 Diamondbacks team that reached the N.L. Championship Series despite being outscored that season. He said the 2007 success led to a “false arrogance” that has been eliminated under Gibson, who credited Upton with maturing. In a game against Houston last week, Upton jawed with the plate umpire, C. B. Bucknor, after his at-bat in the third inning. Soon Arizona was trailing, 7-1, and Gibson gave Upton permission to unload on Bucknor. It was a test. “I told him, ‘If you want to blow it out, go ahead,’ ” Gibson said. “We were getting our butt kicked. I said: ‘Go out there, just make sure you don’t get any more than today; don’t get an extra game. Or, you can stick around, maybe you’ll win the game for us.’ And he did.” Upton directed his anger at the Astros, not Bucknor, doubling in two runs, bashing a two-run home run and lifting the Diamondbacks to an 11-9 victory . The team rose to first place the next day, and has been there ever since. “That wasn’t my choice — that was his choice,” Gibson said. “He’s coming along.” So are the Diamondbacks, who could meet the Phillies again in October.",

    "source": "Super Bowl — Goodell’s Address Dominated by Labor Issue <eos> DALLAS — The N.F.L. and the players union will hold three negotiating sessions in the next week starting Saturday with one month to go before their collective bargaining agreement expires. During his annual state of the league address Friday, Commissioner Roger Goodell reiterated the familiar talking points from the last 18 months, defending management’s push for an 18-game regular season and saying the revenue split with players had swung too far in the union’s favor. The deal expires on March 3. Goodell would not say definitively that owners would lock players out if that date passed without an agreement. But Jeff Pash, the lead negotiator for the owners, said the sides would have to make significant progress by then before they could extend the deadline. Goodell reiterated that he believed it would be more difficult to complete a new deal if the deadline passed, because the N.F.L. anticipates losing revenue from sponsors and season ticket holders. The Pittsburgh Steelers chairman emeritus Dan Rooney said he thought that the $9 billion the N.F.L. generates annually was enough to satisfy everyone. The New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft said Friday he believed a new deal could be reached in a week, and called it “criminal” if one was not completed. Pash said: “It’s time to stop the public events. It’s time to stop the pep rallies. It’s time to stop the Congressional visits. It’s time to stop the litigation. Tell the litigators to stay home. Tell the lobbyists to stay home. Tell the public relations spin doctors to stay home. Let’s get into negotiations and let’s spend as much time negotiating as we’ve spent litigating.” Questions about labor dominated the 45-minute news conference that served as a precursor to the first full negotiating session since Thanksgiving. Goodell and the union chief, DeMaurice Smith, have spoken regularly and smaller groups of officials have met, but the sides agreed to increase the frequency of meetings in coming weeks. Owners and union leaders are expected to meet for at least two hours Saturday at a Dallas hotel, amid an NFL Network report that union officials have discussed with player agents the possibility of having their clients boycott the scouting combine later this month or draft activities in April. The combine is a showcase for college players hoping to improve their draft stock by working out for — and more important, submitting to interviews by — coaches and general managers. The draft will be held as scheduled in April, even if there is no new labor deal by then. Goodell took issue with a contention made by Smith that the share of revenue going to players has gone down since the 2006 deal was struck. Players receive nearly 60 percent of revenue after owners receive a $1 billion cost credit for operating expenses, which is deducted from the revenue pool. “If you want to deal with facts, the president of the union, just in the last week, said that the players got a great deal in 2006,” Goodell said, referring to a statement by Kevin Mawae. “And that clearly is indicating that the pendulum has shifted too far in one direction. You want to make sure that it’s fair to the clubs. You want to make sure it’s fair to the players, but allow our great game to grow. Since 2006, we have not built a new stadium, and that is an issue for us. “This agreement needs to be addressed so we can make the kinds of investments that grow this game and make it great for our fans.”",

She did not start to tear up until she began talking about Lorena Ochoa. Miyazato shot a six-under 67 on Sunday to win the Tres Marias Championship in Morelia, Mexico, but she was overshadowed by Ochoa, the tournament’s host, who played her last competitive round before retiring. “I want to say thanks to Lorena,” Miyazato said during the trophy ceremony. “I really appreciate what she did for the L.P.G.A. and what she did for her country here in Mexico.” “She is one of my best friends,” Miyazato said, beginning to cry. “I’m going to miss her.” Miyazato, a 24-year-old Japanese star who swept the season-opening events in Thailand and Singapore, finished at 19-under 273. Stacy Lewis (66) was a stroke back, and Michelle Wie (68) was third at 17 under. Ochoa, the tournament winner three of the past four years, finished sixth. Ochoa has held the No. 1 ranking since April 2007 but she will lose it when the rankings come out Monday, with Jiyai Shin taking over. She spent her last round saying goodbye. Walking down the first fairway, she stopped to kiss two young boys who were carrying the scoreboard. Approaching the second green, she was embraced by her fellow player Christina Kim, who ran from the eighth green to hug her. As Ochoa walked up the 18th fairway, thousands began waving white handkerchiefs — as they do at a bullfight to salute the bullfighter — and shouted “Lo-re-na!

    "source": "Benefits and Risks of a Suspect Who Likes to Talk <eos> Days after his arrest, the Times Square bombing suspect has not been seen in court, though American law provides a right to be charged promptly before a magistrate, usually within 48 hours. But like a lot of legal rights, that one can be waived. Lawyers and former prosecutors said it could be some time — anywhere from a little while to a long while — before the suspect, Faisal Shahzad , who has been talking with prosecutors and investigators, stands in some baggy jail outfit before a judge. “It’s not the normal course of things, but it’s not unprecedented,” said Daniel C. Richman, a Columbia law professor who is a former federal prosecutor. He said there was no clear outer limit to how much time might pass before a court appearance, as long as Mr. Shahzad properly waived his legal rights. It may suit both sides to keep their momentum going, whether it is full cooperation, boasting or something in between. For prosecutors and investigative agents, the interrogation of a helpful defendant can be a kind of alchemy that works best roped off from the world. A court appearance can break the spell, said Anthony S. Barkow, a former federal terrorism prosecutor in Manhattan who is executive director of a criminal law center at New York University. “All kinds of wheels get set in motion that sometimes makes it difficult to continue the discussion” after an arraignment, Mr. Barkow said. Having a defense lawyer, for example, can be a major impediment. Federal prosecutors declined to comment Thursday on whether Mr. Shahzad has yet consulted a lawyer. He could waive that right as well. Accused people sometimes insist on going it alone for a variety of reasons, including vanity and hubris. Some Islamic prisoners who view themselves as political captives have spurned American lawyers. From the prosecution’s vantage point, a defense lawyer can be a double-edged sword. The presence of a lawyer can limit later claims that a defendant was duped by interrogators, mentally unstable or coerced into saying something false. But on the other hand, a defense lawyer can get in the way. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, one of the staple arguments in the debate about what legal system to use for terrorism prosecutions has been whether the right to counsel may be a luxury the country cannot afford during investigations like the one now under way. The questioning of Mr. Shahzad certainly has both law enforcement and national security aspects. Investigators want to know not only who else might be prosecuted for a role in the failed attack, but also how to try to stop the next one, and where military or intelligence operations might be most useful. “For the government to be able to get at the person directly, without counsel interposed, is something they want,” said Ramzi Kassem, a lawyer for terrorism suspects who is a professor at the City University of New York School of Law in Queens. There are some legal risks in a delay in getting the case into court. Mr. Barkow, the former terrorism prosecutor, said investigators would be careful to document that Mr. Shahzad was acting voluntarily in all his dealings with them, perhaps by signing statements or taping his interviews. “If he waived his rights and that can be demonstrated,” Mr. Barkow said, “there’s really not much of a legal risk” in delaying a court appearance. But other lawyers said that could be a big if. Over time, defendants have a way of changing their minds when confronted with the reality of long prison terms and former allies turned enemies. If Mr. Shahzad’s case travels that route, this period of isolation could become a point of contention, said Professor Richman of Columbia. Should Mr. Shahzad later decide to disavow what he is saying now, he could claim he was mistreated or manipulated while out of reach of the courts. The rule requiring prompt arraignments is rooted in part on an American aversion to people vanishing into secret interrogations. “The longer the period of time is,” Mr. Richman said, “the more plausible will be a claim down the road that any waiver of his rights was not fully voluntary.” James A. Cohen, a criminal law professor at Fordham Law School, said that in the usual case a defendant generally makes it to court quickly. The Times Square case is not the usual case. The exceptions can be for any number of reasons. Informers sometimes stay out of court to keep their legal troubles from new targets of their testimony. Mobsters who switch sides sometimes see secrecy as a way to stay alive. Professor Cohen said Mr. Shahzad’s government handlers are probably focused right now on keeping him talking. “It could be weeks,” he said. “It depends upon the quality of the information he is supplying and how easy or hard it is to confirm.”",

    "source": "Guantánamo Bay Prosecutors Accuse Detainee of Conspiracy <eos> WASHINGTON — Prosecutors for the military commission trials at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, disclosed in a document posted Friday that they had added a charge of conspiracy against an Iraqi detainee, potentially setting up a test of whether Congress has the power to make conspiracy a prosecutable offense in a war-crimes tribunal despite its not being recognized as an international war crime. The detainee, Abd al Hadi al Iraqi, had already been facing a series of terrorism-related charges. But the addition of the conspiracy offense gives his case a larger significance, because the legitimacy of using the tribunals to bring that charge has been the subject of heated debate. Establishing such legitimacy could help make the commissions more useful in future terrorism cases. Last year, a panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out the conviction of a detainee for conspiracy on the grounds that the charge was not recognized under the international laws of war. The Obama administration has appealed , but if the ruling stands, it sharply undermines the utility of tribunals — as opposed to civilian courts — to sentence people to prison who participated in terrorist groups but are not personally linked to any specific attack. But the case that is before the appeals court concerned conduct before 2006, when Congress enacted the first version of the Military Commissions Act. Both that law and a 2009 revision say that commissions have jurisdiction to prosecute conspiracy, raising the question of whether conduct after 2006 may legitimately lead to conspiracy charges before a tribunal. After his capture in late 2006 or early 2007, Mr. Al Iraqi was held by the Central Intelligence Agency before his transfer to military custody in April 2007 , making him among the last detainees to arrive at Guantánamo. He is accused of being a high-level emissary from Al Qaeda to terrorists in Iraq .",

    "source": "Human Remains Found at Ancient Roman-Era Shipwreck <eos> Underwater archaeologists have found a 2,000-year-old skeleton belonging to a victim of the famed Antikythera shipwreck from ancient Roman times. The bones are the latest prize from a treasure trove that has yielded bronze statues, marble sculptures and, most famously, the Antikythera mechanism , a clocklike device thought to be the world’s oldest analog computer. Since its discovery in 1900 by sponge divers, the Antikythera shipwreck has provided archaeologists with a window into the trading practices and culture of the ancient Mediterranean by the recovery of jewelry and trinkets. Now, if the researchers can collect genetic information from the human remains, they will gain their best insight yet into the lives of the people who perished on the vessel in 65 B.C. “We knew this was the find of the decade in terms of underwater archaeology,” said Brendan Foley , a research specialist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute who helped uncover the bones . “We’re hoping that by the end of this year we’ll have the first DNA results from an ancient shipwreck victim.” Image Skeletal remains from the Antikythera Shipwreck buried in the sand. Credit Brett Seymour/EUA-WHOI, via Argo Dr. Foley and his colleagues discovered the remains while excavating the site off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera in late August. One of his fellow divers had alerted him to some long bones he had found some 160 feet below. When Dr. Foley swam over and looked, he thought: “Wow! Oh my god, there’s a whole skeleton here.” The long bones turned out to be the ulna and radius of a forearm. Buried in the sand were also a skull, an upper jaw with some teeth, some ribs and two femurs. They called in Hannes Schroeder , an ancient DNA researcher from the Natural History Museum of Denmark, to help determine whether they could extract genetic information from the bones. Microbes, oxygen and salt water at the bottom of the sea can be detrimental to the survival of ancient DNA, he said. But he is optimistic that they can retrieve some genetic material because the team recovered something called the petrous portion of the temporal bone, which is the hard part behind the ear. Ancient DNA recovered from this part of the skull tends to be better preserved than samples from any other body part, including the teeth. It’s not the first time that researchers have uncovered human remains from the site. In 1976 Jacques Cousteau had found a few bones as well, but he did not have the technology needed to genetically test them. Dr. Schroeder said the reason the team had not done genetic testing on the bones found by Mr. Cousteau is because they could not find the specimens. But he added that even if they had known where the remnants were, testing probably would not have been useful because they most likely would have been contaminated by now. “If we analyze those remains we are more likely to pick up DNA from the curators or archaeologists rather than the remains of the ancient individual,” he said. The most recently found bones are much better preserved, he said, and they could provide information about where the individual came from as well as insight into facial features and diet. The plans are to begin genetic tests as soon as the team receives permission from Greek authorities. “We can’t really get closer to the story of these people than by looking at their actual remains,” he said. “It helps us reconstruct his or her identity and gives us insight into what kind of people undertook this voyage 2,000 years ago.”",

    "source": "Gay on TV: It’s All in the Family <eos> On “Glee” this spring, a transgender character named Unique is competing in a sing-off. On “Grey’s Anatomy,” Arizona and Callie are adjusting to married life, having been pronounced “wife and wife” last year. On “Modern Family,” the nation’s most popular television show , Cameron and his partner Mitchell are trying to adopt a second child. What’s missing? The outrage. The cultural battlefield of television has changed markedly since the 1990s, when conservative groups and religious figures objected to Ellen DeGeneres coming out and “Will & Grace” coming on. Today, it’s rare to hear a complaint about shows like “Modern Family” or the drama “Smash,” which has five openly gay characters, or the sitcom “Happy Endings,” which, against stereotype, has a husky and lazy gay male character . To the contrary. Mitt Romney is known to be a fan of “Modern Family,” and a Catholic group gave it a media award this month . Next week in New York the major networks will announce a slate of new shows, including a sitcom on NBC that features a gay couple and their surrogate. The title: “The New Normal.” At a time when gay rights are re-emerging as an election year issue — in part because of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ’s stated support for gay marriage on Sunday — activists and academics say that depictions of gay characters on television play a big role in making viewers more comfortable with their gay, lesbian and transgender neighbors. “TV and movie representation matters,” said Edward Schiappa, a professor of communication studies at the University of Minnesota . In five separate studies, Mr. Schiappa and his colleagues have found that the presence of gay characters on television programs decreases prejudices among viewers of the programs. “These attitude changes are not huge — they don’t change bigots into saints. But they can snowball,” Mr. Schiappa said. Mr. Biden apparently agrees. He said on Sunday that “Will & Grace,” which ran from 1998 to 2006, “probably did more to educate the American public than almost anything anybody’s ever done so far.” When that sitcom began on NBC, it was seen as controversial. Several conservative groups claimed that it and shows like it would make homosexuality seem desirable. Some groups said the same about “Ellen,” the ABC sitcom starring Ellen DeGeneres, who came out as a lesbian on the show and in real life in 1997. Ms. DeGeneres threatened to quit a year later when ABC preceded an “Ellen” episode that showed her jokingly kissing a friend with a message that warned, “Due to adult content, parental discretion is advised.” That warning would not appear today, as complaints about gay characters on shows like “Modern Family” and “Glee” barely ever bubble to the surface. When a group called One Million Moms tried to have Ms. DeGeneres fired this year by J.C. Penney , which had hired her to star in TV commercials, the company’s chief executive defended her and the group gave up. When the Fox News host Bill O’Reilly briefly made a fuss about the Unique character on “Glee” last month, criticizing the show for “shock value,” his comments gained little notice. (“Glee” is broadcast on Fox , whose parent company, News Corporation , also owns Fox News). Still, when one of Mr. O’Reilly’s guests complained last fall when Chaz Bono became the first openly transgender contestant on ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars,” Mr. O’Reilly supported Mr. Bono, who lasted six weeks on the show. Upon being voted off, he said he had participated in part because if there had been “somebody like me on TV when I was growing up, my whole life would have been different.” Perhaps wary of being perceived as moralizing, producers and writers in Hollywood — a predominately liberal town — say that the viewer support of gay, lesbian and transgender characters is just a happy byproduct of their storytelling. “I think I would be lying if I said that I didn’t expect, at some point, for some narrow-minded group of people to try to create some publicity” around “Glee” or “Modern Family,” said Dana Walden, the chairwoman of 20th Century Fox Television, which produces both shows. “The bottom line is that people embrace these characters completely.” Steven Levitan, a co-creator of “Modern Family,” said he thought that when the show started, the inclusion of Cameron and Mitchell would “limit our success a bit, because it will perhaps alienate a certain segment of the population.” “In fact,” he said, “it’s turned out to be quite the opposite,” a point he reiterated last fall when the series won its second Emmy Award for best comedy. Media watchdogs like the Parents Television Council , one of the most active conservative media groups, do occasionally speak out against TV programming; but a spokeswoman for the council said it did not distinguish between gay and straight content. Of the shows with gay plot lines, “Glee” has been the most scrutinized: Dan Gainor, a representative of another prominent group, the Media Research Center , said it “merely pretends to be a show for young people” while actually serving as an “assault on traditional values and morality.” His group, though, focuses more on purported liberal bias in the news media than on prime-time programming. While campaigns against shows with gay characters are now rare, the pressure on networks to include them has grown. There was a fan outcry , for example, when the gay couple on “Modern Family” did not kiss in the sitcom’s first season. The producers insisted that the wait was intentional, and the second season included a story line about Mitchell’s disdain for public displays of affection, as well as many kisses between the characters. In an interview Mr. Levitan, who used to be an anchorman in Madison , Wis., cited a newsroom saying: “Don’t tell me how this law is affecting two million people, show me one family that it’s affecting and it’ll be more powerful.” “I have to think that it’s the same case here,” he said. Some producers say they have marveled at how fast the opinions of television viewers have changed, even as gay rights activists have marveled at how voters across the country have shifted on gay marriage. “What this is about, really, is how far America has come, not how far television has come,” said Christopher Lloyd, a co-creator of “Modern Family.” Shonda Rhimes , the “Grey’s Anatomy” producer, recalled having to “go to the mattresses with broadcast standards and practices” at ABC in 2006 to insist on preserving a steamy shower sequence with three female doctors. That sequence was just a fantasy in the mind of one of the male characters — but now six years later, in the show’s version of reality, two female doctors are married. “Nobody even blinked” at the relationship, Ms. Rhimes said. The only outcry she recalled came when one of the doctors, Arizona, flirted with a man. “It was from lesbians who said, ‘How dare she sleep with a man!’ ”",

Although he did not identify the enemies to whom the defendants are accused of passing information, Iran often uses the word to refer to the United States and Israel.

And you will always discover your dog has had an accident overnight on the morning you are late for work. A class of tech start-ups that specialize in food delivery is also being reminded of one of life’s hard truths: Trying to duplicate what local pizza shops have been doing for decades — usually for free — is not necessarily innovative. Investors put more than $730 million on companies like DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates from early 2014 through the first half of 2015, according to data from CB Insights, a venture capital analytics firm. The hope was that once these companies became big enough, they’d be very profitable. But as delivery start-ups like Kozmo.com and Webvan discovered in the dot-com boom, getting to that point is not easy. For starters, you have to pay for drivers. Then you have to cut deals with restaurants and manage orders from customers. And you have to find lots of people willing to pay a premium for that food delivery. Will this new generation be a cautionary tale for the next generation of food delivery start-ups? Perhaps not. But turning this tricky business into a profitable enterprise is proving, yet again, to be elusive.",

    "source": "In Turnaround, Louisiana Governor Vetoes Bill Doubling Lawmakers’ Pay <eos> BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Gov. Bobby Jindal vetoed a bill on Monday that would have doubled legislators’ salaries, reversing his position and breaking a promise to lawmakers that he would stay out of the matter. The raise had infuriated voters, leading some to file recall petitions against Mr. Jindal and two of his top allies in the Legislature. Mr. Jindal, a Republican, said he should not have promised not to intervene. “Today I am correcting my mistake,” he said. The announcement came two weeks after the Legislature approved the raise. Mr. Jindal said at the time that he disapproved of the raise but that he would allow it to become law. Mr. Jindal became a target for stinging attacks, with some critics pointing out that he had promised in his campaign last year to prohibit lawmakers from approving such a raise for themselves. On Monday, Mr. Jindal said he hoped that lawmakers would continue to support his proposals and work with him. “They’ve got a right to be angry with me,” he said. “I made a mistake in telling them I’d stay out of it.” Mr. Jindal made the surprise announcement at a news conference that had been scheduled to discuss state budget matters. The House speaker, Jim Tucker, Republican of Terrytown, later released a brief statement that said, “I respect Governor Jindal’s veto of Senate Bill 672.” Mr. Tucker defended the raise as an effort to help lower-income people serve in the House or Senate. The move on Monday led organizers of the recall drive to drop their efforts against Mr. Jindal, Mr. Tucker and Representative Hunter V. Greene, Republican of Baton Rouge. The bill would have raised lawmakers’ annual base pay to $37,500 from $16,800. It would have made Louisiana legislators the highest paid in the South and the 14th-highest paid in the country, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",

    "source": "E.P.A. to Bolster Testing Because of Volkswagen Scandal <eos> Government regulators said Friday that they planned to step up the testing requirements of cars in the wake of the Volkswagen scandal. The Environmental Protection Agency, which disclosed last week that it had learned that Volkswagen diesel cars had equipment to evade smog-testing standards, said it had sent a letter to manufacturers of gasoline and diesel cars saying that regulators would be looking for so-called defeat devices in all vehicles. The agency said Volkswagen had used a device programmed to fool emissions testers into thinking that the car was emitting much less pollution than it was during regular driving. “Manufacturers should expect that this additional testing may add time to the confirmatory test process,” the E.P.A. wrote in its brief letter . The agency said that the new procedures would start immediately and that the California Air Resources Board and Canada’s environmental regulators were involved with the more stringent requirements. E.P.A. officials said they would not outline specifics of what the new tests will entail. “We are not going to tell them what these tests are, and they don’t need to know,” Chris Grundler, director of the agency’s office of transportation and air quality, said during a conference call with reporters. On Tuesday, Volkswagen said that 11 million of its diesel cars worldwide contained the software. The E.P.A. said that the deception allowed Volkswagen vehicles to spew as much as 40 times the pollution allowed under the Clean Air Act . The company has not yet issued a formal recall for the vehicles that were affected, and the E.P.A. said such notice would come from the manufacturer and not the E.P.A. itself. The agency said it was continuing its investigation.",

    "source": "Hampton Creek, Maker of Just Mayo, Is Said to Be Under Inquiry <eos> Hampton Creek, a prominent start-up that is trying to bring tech industry panache to the world of mayonnaise, ranch dressing and other food products, has come under scrutiny by regulators for its business practices. The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a preliminary inquiry into Hampton Creek, according to a person briefed on the situation who asked not to be named because it had not been announced publicly. The S.E.C. inquiry is a response to a recent report from Bloomberg News that described an organized effort by Hampton Creek to buy large quantities of its Just Mayo product — a mayonnaise that uses a plant-based ingredient instead of eggs — by sending undercover contractors into stores. Kevin J. Callahan, a spokesman for the S.E.C., declined to comment. Bloomberg earlier reported the S.E.C. inquiry. Hampton Creek’s chief executive, Joshua Tetrick, said he had heard from the S.E.C. about the informal inquiry but declined to give further details. Bloomberg’s report said the product buyback effort, which took place in 2014, made Just Mayo seem more popular than it was, not long before Hampton Creek raised $90 million from venture capitalists and other private investors. The basic details of the program were confirmed by a former Hampton Creek employee, who asked for anonymity because of confidentiality restrictions with his onetime employer. After the report, Mr. Tetrick wrote in a blog post that the mayonnaise shopping spree was part of a quality control program that had minimal impact on overall sales. The inquiry puts a cloud over Hampton Creek, which has described itself as the fastest-growing food company in the world. It has promised to tackle the food industry with the gusto of a technology start-up, using some of the same big data tools to do so. One of its goals is to identify healthy, plant-based ingredients that can substitute for common foods like eggs, with less of a negative impact on the environment. Hampton Creek, based in San Francisco, has been praised by the likes of Bill Gates ; received financial backing from prominent Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors like Marc Benioff and Vinod Khosla; and succeeded in getting its products widely distributed at Walmart, Costco, Whole Foods and other retailers. The inquiry may be only the start of tougher questions facing Hampton Creek. The company is believed to be losing significant amounts of money. It is raising up to $220 million from investors, according to a Delaware filing provided by Equidate, which tracks private company shares. It’s not uncommon, of course, for start-ups to bleed red ink in their early days. But Hampton Creek, founded in 2011, faces some basic challenges with the manufacturing costs for its products. According to one former employee, in 2014 the company had negative gross margins of about 20 percent on Just Mayo, meaning that the raw cost to the company for every $1 it got in sales was about $1.20. Image Just Mayo products use a plant-based ingredient instead of eggs. Joshua Tetrick, the company’s chief executive, said Just Mayo planned to break even by the end of next year. The issue arises from Hampton Creek’s use of premium ingredients in its products without charging shoppers the often eye-popping prices attached to such food products. The vegetable oil used in Just Mayo, for example, does not come from genetically modified organism sources, which adds significant cost, according to the former employee. But on Walmart.com on Friday, a 30-ounce jar of Just Mayo was selling for $3.66 — 32 cents less than a jar of Hellmann’s mayonnaise of the same size. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Tetrick said the company planned to break even by the end of next year. “We are fortunate to be well capitalized,” he said, declining to disclose how much the company had in the bank. He added that some of Hampton Creek’s dressings, mayonnaise and food service cookie products were gross-margin-positive, meaning they generated more revenue than they cost to make. “We’re not trying to optimize at every turn, thinking, ‘What’s the margin?’” he said. “It’s about solving the bigger food problem. You know what we do about it? We attack it.” The company’s program to buy its own mayonnaise has raised eyebrows among retail analysts. Food makers typically do quality checks through every step of production until the product lands on grocery shelves. Kurt Jetta, chief executive of TABS Analytics, a research firm, said that while he had heard of companies buying their own products off retail shelves, in most of those cases, “it’s to jack up the sales numbers, not for quality assurance.” He also said paying retail prices to buy products for quality assurance made “zero financial sense.” When food companies want to move a product off a grocery shelf to replace it with a reformulated or newly packaged version or because it has passed its expiration date, they issue a credit to the store manager — and then only to cover the price the retailer paid, not the consumer price. Some food industry consultants, though, said it was not unheard-of for companies to buy their food products off shelves. Stericycle is a company that helps manufacturers with “audits” of their products for quality assurance purposes. “Manufacturers and retailers may need help with on-site resolution, including handling consumer complaints, product quality evaluation and much more, but they may not have the internal staff to handle those things quickly and efficiently,” said Kevin Pollack, vice president and general manager at Stericycle. Word of the program was mentioned briefly in a lawsuit against Hampton Creek filed this year on behalf of two former contractors for the company who were seeking unpaid wages. The contractors worked in stores in 2014 and 2015, representing Hampton Creek and handing out samples of Just Mayo to spread word of the product. But according to the lawsuit, Hampton Creek required the contractors to also “buy out shelves of Defendant’s products.”",

    "source": "On Eve of Masters, Woods Is Changed but Familiar <eos> A book arrived in the mail for Tiger Woods , one promising insight into his upended life. Not “The Big Miss,” the work of pulp friction by his former swing coach Hank Haney, but “The Noticer,” a thin novel heavy on perspective. Jerry West, the Hall of Fame basketball player, sent the book after Woods’s serial adultery became headline fodder in late 2009. In an interview this year, West said he had included a note in which he expressed his concern for Woods’s well-being and his hope and belief that Woods would emerge from his personal crisis wiser and no less motivated to become the greatest golfer ever. After three years of standing in place in his pursuit of Jack Nicklaus’s record 18 major victories, Woods suddenly has a strong wind at his back. He comes into this week’s Masters, the first men’s major of 2012, fresh off his first official PGA Tour victory in two and a half years, at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Woods, a four-time Masters champion, has straightened out his driving and found his putting stroke. He is clearly a better golfer in 2012 than he was in 2010. But is he a different person? Two years ago, Woods arrived at the Masters after a four-month exile during which he dealt with the personal issues, and he was publicly chastised by the Augusta National Golf Club chairman, Billy Payne. In his opening address, Payne said, “I hope he now realizes that every kid he passes on the course wants his swing but would settle for his smile.” Payne added, “But certainly his future will never again be measured only by his performance against par, but measured by the sincerity of his efforts to change.” The thousand-yard stare is still there. Woods’s game face can still practically melt the iron in a competitor’s hands. The weekend of the Honda Classic, where Woods tied for second, his gallery included Lexi Thompson, 17, who last year became the youngest winner of an L.P.G.A. event. Asked what she had learned from watching Woods, Thompson said: “Just how focused he is. He didn’t let anything get to him. There were people screaming at him the whole time and it was like he didn’t even notice.” Woods’s poker-faced mask slipped when he was walking off a green and saw Thompson waving a Tiger towel that another fan had given her. “He did a double take,” she said. “He gave me this look like, ‘What are you doing here and why do you have that in your hands?’ It was pretty funny.” The Woods of old was a magician. Through sheer concentration, he could make the largest galleries in golf disappear. The new Woods is less aloof, more apt to try to make a connection. In the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, he was grouped with Hunter Mahan and Ernie Els. The group’s standard-bearer that day was Jeff Danjou, who said he had been volunteering at the tournament for several years. “Tiger stopped to talk to me and the scorer, asked how we were doing,” Danjou said, adding, “He threw a couple of golf balls out to kids and acknowledged the crowd more than I had seen before.” On the eve of the World Golf Championship match-play event outside Tucson, Woods declined an invitation to the interview room but stood outside the clubhouse, just off the parking lot, and answered reporters’ questions for 10 minutes before his practice session. The last question came from a young woman who identified herself as a participant in the local First Tee program. “When I play a round and I have a bad shot, I tend to get frustrated,” she said. “So I was wondering, how do you get back into balance after a bad hole?” In his most expansive answer of the day, Woods said: “I think that’s a good thing you get frustrated. Because obviously you have expectations of what you can do, what you can accomplish. And I think that’s good. I would challenge you to try and channel that type of energy and that frustration into focus for the next one. There are times when, yeah, I get angry, and I get angry on purpose, to get my energy up, so that I will be focused for the next one more so than I was at a previous one.” The young woman hung on Woods’s every word. As he left the microphone stand, she held out a pin flag for him to sign. He walked right past her. At the Presidents Cup last year, Woods stopped to chat with his teammates when he ran into them at the hotel. That made an impression on Fred Couples, the United States captain, who had made Woods one of his discretionary picks. The Woods of old, he said, never left his zone, even after he left the course. “Tiger, to me, he’s a totally different person,” Couples said. “He’s got to be.” In “The Noticer,” the author, Andy Andrews, writes of being down and out and living under a pier when he is visited by a sage who helps him to see that a life characterized by happiness and abundance begins with his owning up to bad choices and decisions and adopting a grateful perspective. West said he wrote in his note to Woods, “Sometimes you have to fall, and fall hard, in order to gain the personal wisdom that Andy Andrews’s book speaks about.” Reached by telephone, Andrews expressed appreciation that West had passed his book on to Woods. “I think Jerry West had exactly the right idea,” he said. “He read the situation accurately. Tiger would have his defenses up in such a huge way. A lot of times, people have to come to these conclusions on their own. Jerry West knew he could not give Tiger a book with the title ‘How to Get Your Life in Order After a Disaster,’ but he could say, ‘Here’s a cool book I read that you might like.’ ” Andrews, who does not know Woods, said he had heard a radio interview in which Woods talked about mistakes he had made. The sage in “The Noticer,” Andrews said, would tell Woods he had made choices, not mistakes. “There’s a big difference,” Andrews said, adding: “It’s about living in the truth. Only then can there be a reset.” At his low point, when he was living under the pier, Andrews’s level of distrust was greater than the water level at high tide. When he met the man who transformed his life, Andrews said his first question was, “Are you going to rob me?” Woods’s brusque responses to questions about “The Big Miss” suggest he feels as if his inner circle had been robbed and his confidences snatched when Haney chose to write about their six-year partnership. “The Noticer” is another story. West says he has no idea how Woods felt about it. “I don’t know if Tiger received the book,” he said. “But if he did, I hope he read it.”",

It was falling behind in scandal and mayhem news. For a while there, Southern California was stealing all its thunder. While everyone fixated on the Reggie Bush fiasco, the SEC was left waving in the background, “Hey, the N.C.A.A. is looking into the recruiting hostesses at Tennessee!” Well, now it’s got something to really crow about: the prohibitive favorite for the Heisman Trophy is drawing allegations the way Lindsay Lohan draws paparazzi. Yes, that’s Auburn quarterback Cam Newton, accused of academic malfeasance before he transferred from Florida, and now ESPN.com’s Joe Schad reports others are claiming Newton was shopping himself around for a price when he chose Auburn. All kidding aside, it’s a mess . Auburn officials lashed out amid the storm on Tuesday, although as Kevin Scarbinsky writes in The Birmingham News , the college is going to have to look a lot harder to decide whether the allegations have merit. The SEC is taking its share of heat , too, considering two of its colleges are playing a starring role here. The next drama may move right to the Heisman voting, writes Andy Staples on SI.com . With Bush having been relieved of his, will people be eager to hand out another that might get returned? Should they give them out with postage-paid return boxes now? Michael Rosenberg of SI.com suggests an ankle tether. If you need a college football story with some redemptive qualities after reading all that, check out this article on the Oklahoma State recruit Hershel Sims , whose road to success passed through a horrific childhood of abuse. On a much lighter note, feel free to join in the widespread cackling over Derek Jeter’s winning a Gold Glove award at shortstop, which is slightly less egregious than Johnny Knoxville winning an Oscar for “Jackass 3D.” It highlights a ridiculous voting system, writes John Harper in The New York Daily News , that would be helped if the Gold Glove wasn’t treated like some lifetime achievement award, writes Matthew Leach on MLB.com . The Gold Gloves were, however, but a momentary diversion in the off-season obsession with free agents, which, as Tom Verducci writes on SI.com , should come with warning labels. The N.F.L. is considering affixing warning labels to offensive players, or maybe we just read that between the lines of the new memo the N.F.L. put out on brain-scrambling hits. The issue continues to draw some less-than-intelligent responses from players, including the Steelers’ Troy Polamalu’s idea to have players vote on discipline. Perhaps lost in the reverberations of those hits, the playoff races are starting to look like a Nascar pileup, writes Don Banks on SI.com , and Oakland’s stunning return to relevance, writes Clark Judge on CBSSports.com , has actually given the league a lift. While you’re still scratching your head over that, consider Jason Cole of Yahoo.com’s contention that the Cowboys’ collapse this season could affect the possibility of a lockout. Bizarre news stretches all the way down to high school football, where a Connecticut coach was suspended for using an opponent’s play sheet, and even middle school, where this video of an outrageous trick play has become a YouTube hit .

    "source": "U.S. Ski Jumper Lindsey Van Wins First Women’s World Title <eos> For 13 years, Lindsey Van has battled knee injuries and toiled in anonymity, struggling to help push her sport into the mainstream. So on Friday, when she was faced with shifting winds for her final jump at the first world championships for women’s ski jumping, she tried to take it all in stride. Van soared 97.5 meters (319.9 feet) on her second of two jumps to win the gold medal at the Nordic World Ski Championships in Liberec, Czech Republic. She was joined in unexpected triumph by Todd Lodwick, who won the Nordic combined event. At a competition normally dominated by Scandinavians, the national anthem for the United States was played twice in one day. “It feels totally amazing,” Van said during a conference call. “It’s hard to even think about what really happened.” Van, a 24-year-old from Park City, Utah, hoped her victory would help bring attention to women’s ski jumping’s effort to join the Olympic program. In 2006, the International Olympic Committee turned down the sport’s application for the 2010 Vancouver Games, saying that the sport had not developed enough. But Van and nine other athletes from around the world have filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of British Columbia to force the Vancouver Organizing Committee to include the sport. A hearing is scheduled for April 20. Ski jumping is the only winter Olympic sport that does not include both men and women. “I’m frustrated every day in this sport, with all the problems we’ve had,” Van said. “I’m trying to be optimistic about it, but it’s hard.” Van, who started jumping at age 7, has won 13 national jumping championships, but this was the first opportunity for women at the world championships. A total of 36 jumpers from 13 countries competed; countries were limited to four jumpers. Van earned a total of 243 points for her two jumps. Ulrike Graessler of Germany finished second, with 239, and Anette Sagen of Norway was third with 238.5. The other members of the United States team — Jessica Jerome, Alissa Johnson and Sarah Hendrickson — finished 6th, 20th and 29th. Van was fourth after her first jump. Snow and shifting winds made the conditions difficult; Van said she could not see much past the tips of her skis. When she landed, though, she got the adrenaline rush that has kept her in the sport. “You can make 100 bad jumps and one good one and you’re addicted,” she said. Van sustained a major knee injury last February, and it required five months of rehabilitation. She said she still felt the effects. Van said the sport was ready and that the field at the world championships would have been even stronger if countries had not been limited to four jumpers. “I think the sport is quite developed,” she said. “It is a young sport, so we have young jumpers. But it’s definitely ready.”",

    "source": "Where FIFA Stands After Blatter’s Resignation <eos> Questions and answers about the resignation of FIFA president Sepp Blatter , and the indictments of 14 soccer officials and marketing executives on corruption charges. What’s the Latest? ■ Jack Warner, the former FIFA vice president who was indicted last week, said he knew why the organization’s president, Sepp Blatter, announced plans to step down. “Blatter knows why he fell. And if anyone else knows, I do,” Mr. Warner said in his home country of Trinidad and Tobago on Wednesday. During a rambling and sometimes incoherent seven-minute television address , called “The Gloves Are Off,” Mr. Warner invoked Gandhi and sought to cast himself as a victim. He said he had reams of documents, including copies of checks, linking Mr. Blatter and other senior FIFA officials to an effort to manipulate a 2010 election in Trinidad and Tobago. ■ Russia, which will host the World Cup in 2018, and Qatar, the site of the 2022 event, made clear that they would fiercely object to any effort to strip them of the tournament. Alexander Yakovenko, Russia’s ambassador to Britain, said on Twitter that claims that Russia could lose its right to host the games were “preposterous.” “We have support of FIFA, despite outside pressure,” he wrote. Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa bin Ahmed al-Thani, president of the Qatar Football Association, said that the country had been cleared of any wrongdoing, and welcomed an investigation by the Swiss authorities into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. ■ Mr. Blatter returned to work on Wednesday and got a standing ovation from FIFA staff members after an emotional 10-minute address, The Associated Press reported. ■ Sepp Blatter said Tuesday that he would resign from the presidency of FIFA in the wake of a corruption inquiry, an extraordinary turn just four days after he was re-elected and defiantly insisted that he was blameless and committed to cleaning up the organization. Mr. Blatter, who was re-elected as FIFA’s president on Friday, said he would ask FIFA to schedule a new election for his replacement as soon as possible. Video In the wake of a corruption inquiry at FIFA, Mr. Blatter first said, “I would like to stay with you,” while promising to reform the organization. But on Tuesday he said he would step down. Credit Credit Sebastien Bozon/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images ■ The federal authorities believe that Blatter’s top lieutenant at FIFA, Jérôme Valcke, made $10 million in bank transactions that are central elements of the bribery scandal engulfing international soccer, United States officials and others briefed on the case said Monday. The revelation puts the money trail closer to Mr. Blatter , FIFA’s president, than had been previously known. The money was paid by FIFA to a development fund for Caribbean soccer administered by Jack Warner, a former FIFA vice president who was indicted last week in a broad corruption inquiry. FIFA released a statement confirming the payment but denying any impropriety by its officials, but Britain’s Press Association reported that it had obtained a letter addressed to Mr. Valcke that requested the $10 million transfer. ■ FIFA’s medical chief, Michel D’Hooghe, the longest-serving member on the executive committee, on Monday threatened to leave international soccer’s governing body unless it made rapid reforms. “I cannot reconcile myself with an institution where I work, where I have carried the medical responsibility for 27 years and about which I now learn that there is a lot of corruption,” Mr. D’Hooghe told the VRT television network in Belgium. “My conclusion is very clear: I will no longer continue to participate under such conditions. So, it is high time for change to come and we will see over the coming days what may happen. Let’s be clear, if this atmosphere prevails at FIFA, I have no place there.” ■ FIFA’s ethics committee provisionally barred the former Concacaf general secretary Enrique Sanz from all soccer-related activity. Mr. Sanz was not among the soccer officials named in a Justice Department indictment last Wednesday but was barred by FIFA, it said, “on the basis of investigations carried out by the investigatory chamber of the ethics committee.” A former executive with the sports media company Traffic Sports, which also was caught up in the indictments, Mr. Sanz was placed on a leave of absence by Concacaf on Thursday. What’s Next? Mr. Blatter’s resignation is not immediate. A special meeting of FIFA’s member nations will be called to elect a new president. According to FIFA’s rules, there must be at least four months’ notice given to members for such a meeting, so the likely window for a new election is from December 2015 to March 2016. Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, who last week lost a close election to unseat Mr. Blatter as FIFA president, hinted that he would be open to making a new run at the job now that Mr. Blatter has announced he will leave the post. Prince Ali told CNN that he would be “at the disposal” of anyone who wanted change at FIFA, including those who may have been “afraid to do so” before Blatter’s resignation on Tuesday. “At the end of the day we have to salvage FIFA,” he said. Who Was Charged? Here Are the FIFA Officials Indicted on Corruption Charges A look at the 14 people, including FIFA officials, who face racketeering, conspiracy and corruption charges in the United States. In Custody in Switzerland Jeffrey Webb: President of Concacaf, one of the six regional confederations that compose FIFA, and a vice president of FIFA; Eugenio Figueredo: Former president of Conmebol, the South American soccer federation; Eduardo Li: President of the Costa Rican soccer federation, who was to join the FIFA executive committee last week; Julio Rocha: President of the Nicaraguan soccer federation; Costas Takkas: Former president of the Cayman Islands soccer federation; Rafael Esquivel: President of the Venezuelan soccer federation; José Maria Marin: Former president of Brazil’s soccer federation. These seven men were arrested by the Swiss authorities — at the request of United States law enforcement — last Wednesday in a dawn police operation at their luxury hotel in Zurich, where they had gathered for FIFA’s annual congress. They remain in custody in Zurich, reportedly confined to their cells for as much as 23 hours a day. Six of the seven have contested their extradition to the United States, Switzerland’s Federal Office of Justice said, meaning American officials will have 40 days to file formal requests. One of the men — it is unclear which — has agreed to expedited extradition. All seven have been provisionally banned from all soccer-related activities by FIFA’s ethics committee. Released on Bail Jack Warner: Former president of Concacaf and former vice president of FIFA Warner, who resigned from FIFA in 2011 amid an earlier ethics scandal, turned himself in to the police in his native Trinidad last week. A judge read out the 12 charges against him and released him on bail of about $400,000. He must report in to the authorities regularly as a condition of his release. His next court hearing is July 12, according to The Associated Press, but Warner, 72, may eventually end up in an American courtroom since the United States and Trinidad have a bilateral extradition agreement. He has repeatedly, defiantly and, at times, comically professed his innocence. Under House Arrest Nicolás Leoz: A former president of Conmebol and former member of FIFA executive committee. A judge in Paraguay on Monday ordered the detention of Leoz, 86, who had been receiving medical treatment for high blood pressure. “He is under house arrest,” said a district police commissioner Clemente Espinola. “There’s a patrol car outside his house.” He, too, has been provisionally banned from soccer by FIFA. Arraigned in New York Aaron Davidson: President of Traffic Sports USA, a promoter of soccer events, and chairman of the board of the North American Soccer League. Davidson, 44, pleaded not guilty in Brooklyn federal court on Friday and was released on a $5 million bond secured by several real estate properties. He cannot leave his New York apartment without permission. Davidson has been provisionally banned from soccer by FIFA and suspended from any role in the N.A.S.L. , though the team owned by his company, the Carolina Railhawks, will continue to operate and play league matches. Arrest Warrants Issued Alejandro Burzaco: President of the sports media company Torneos; Hugo Jinkis and Mariano Jinkis: Father and son — and president and vice president — who run the sports media company Full Play International. An Argentine judge issued arrested warrants last Thursday for Burzaco and Hugo and Mariano Jinkis, and that country’s tax authorities said they had opened an investigation into tax evasion. Interpol raided the offices of the two companies on Friday, and it has issued red alerts for the men’s arrest. Burzaco , 50, and both Hugo , 70, and Mariano Jinkis , 40, are listed as “wanted” on Interpol’s website. José Margulies: Sports media executive. Charged as an intermediary who facilitated illegal payments, reportedly in exchange for an annual commission. Margulies, 75, is listed as “ wanted ” by Interpol. Various news reports list him as a Brazilian and as an Argentine. Like several of the others named in the indictments, he is charged with racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud. The Rise and Fall of Sepp Blatter Scandal and accusations have dotted the FIFA reign of Sepp Blatter. Will Sepp Blatter Face Charges? Mr. Blatter has not been charged, although the soccer officials who were indicted might present prosecutors with information damaging to him. Law enforcement officials in the United States, speaking on the condition of anonymity , said Mr. Blatter was the focus of a federal corruption investigation.",

    "source": "Arriving in Vietnam, Obama Aims to Lure It Away From China <eos> HANOI, Vietnam — President Obama arrived in the steamy capital of Vietnam ahead of schedule on Sunday night to begin three days of meetings in hopes of luring yet another Southeast Asian country away from China’s tight embrace. He was greeted on the tarmac by a young woman in a long yellow dress who handed him a bouquet of flowers. Several second-tier Vietnamese officials shook the president’s hand before he climbed into his limousine for a quick trip to his hotel after nearly 24 hours of travel. Quiet clusters of people on the dark streets watched his motorcade pass. Except for the small groups, the streets seemed to have been completely cleared. Since Air Force One had been scheduled to land after midnight, or about three hours later, the official arrival ceremony with high officials in attendance was postponed until Monday morning. Maybe then Mr. Obama will see the kind of emotional outpouring that greeted President Bill Clinton in 2000, when he became the first United States president to visit the country since the Vietnam War. But it is possible that relations between the two countries have reached a stage that the arrival of an American head of state no longer seems so unusual. Mr. Obama will meet with the country’s newly installed prime minister and president on Monday, then get together with the country’s real power — Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of the Communist Party. Mr. Obama’s visit is an important step in a complex dance that Vietnam has carried on with China for centuries. Most of Vietnam’s illustrious historical figures made their reputations by battling Chinese invaders. The population here is deeply nationalistic and anti-Chinese sentiment is visceral. The American War, as it is known here, is mostly forgotten, particularly since half of the population is under 30. Vietnam relies on China for trade, investment and even the water that feeds the vast Mekong Delta, so the leadership knows it can poke the dragon only so much. Indeed, Vietnam had mostly sought to appease China since a brief and bloody war between the countries in 1979, and had shrugged off a series of provocations as China sought in recent years to assert its dominance over the South China Sea, which extends the length of Vietnam’s 2,000-mile coast. But in 2014, China placed a giant deep-sea drilling rig to explore for oil and gas right off the Vietnamese coast, and Mr. Trong could not even get his telephone calls to Beijing returned. The confrontation touched off angry protests in Vietnam that led to the deaths of two Chinese and the destruction of Taiwanese and South Korean factories. Since then, Vietnam has stepped up its contacts with the United States. Neither the United States nor Vietnam is ready for a formal alliance, but Vietnam may grant American warships access to its ports, and Washington seems certain at least to widen exceptions to its longtime arms embargo and may end it altogether. Human rights remain a barrier to closer ties. Government-backed thugs routinely attack dissidents, and recent protests over a toxic spill that killed vast numbers of fish led to beatings and arrests by the police. While the country does have elections — polling places were packed Sunday for a parliamentary election — candidates must be approved by the Communist Party. Mr. Obama plans to meet with some dissidents and civil society leaders on Tuesday before making a speech. Brad Adams, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch, suggested that the president “should start by calling for the right of all people to stand for election, voice critical views of government, associate with others and freely choose candidates.” American help in reforming Vietnam’s economy is also high on the agenda for leaders of both countries. While Vietnam has grown robustly — the transformation of this city’s airport and skyline over the past two decades is astonishing — the country remains saddled with a bloated state sector that dominates telecommunications and other crucial parts of the economy, and reliance on low-wage manufacturing that will be increasingly difficult to sustain as the country prospers. Widespread corruption undermines economic growth; government officials with modest salaries can be seen touring the countryside in expensive European automobiles. There are keen hopes here that the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a trade agreement with the United States and 10 other countries, will provide a huge boost. The World Bank estimated that Vietnam would gain the most from the agreement , adding 10 percent to its economic growth by 2030 through increased sales from its textiles and apparel industries. Vietnam is the only developing country in the Trans-Pacific pact, and it had to make major concessions on issues like allowing independent labor unions and ensuring environmental compliance. “Vietnam has agreed to allow independent unions that can control their own finances, elect their own leaders, conduct strikes, affiliate as they wish, get assistance from outside labor organizations,” the United States trade representative, Michael Froman, said in a briefing. There is some debate about whether the promised changes are transformational or just cosmetic, but the government took a risk in promising to make them and is now dismayed to see that the pact has little chance of passing Congress anytime soon. Still, innovation incubators, technology start-ups and a focus on small and medium-size companies are now all the rage among development agencies and government officials. Mr. Obama intends to address attendees at an entrepreneurship event on Tuesday afternoon in Ho Chi Minh City.",

    "source": "Police Tactics in New York City Housing Are Criticized <eos> A Manhattan judge criticized the policing tactics in New York City Housing Authority developments, ruling on Tuesday that officers appeared to be routinely flouting the law by questioning people without legal justification. The decision by acting Supreme Court Justice Analisa J. Torres barred the admission of 29 plastic bags of cocaine that the police seized last February from Jose Ventura in the lobby of the Baruch Houses on the Lower East Side. More broadly, the court action renewed a debate about the policing tactics in public housing, including the use of “stop, question and frisk” and vertical patrols. Officers use violations of Housing Authority rules — which forbid people from being in city housing projects unless they live there or are visiting someone — to justify the stops. In her ruling, Justice Torres cited the testimony by Police Officer Jason Del Toro, who said the police could simply question anyone they encountered inside a public housing building. The judge wrote that officers had to have a legally meaningful reason for the stop, such as the site being drug- prone. “To the extent that Del Toro’s description of vertical patrols is accurate, that in public housing the police routinely engage in random, unjustified questioning — and there is evidence that they do — the practice would amount to a systematic violation” of the court decision that spells out the legal basis for stops and questioning, Justice Torres wrote. Officer Del Toro approached Mr. Ventura during a vertical patrol simply after spotting him and without establishing a legal reason to question him, the judge wrote. In testimony at a suppression hearing, the officer never mentioned “whether the building or the area is drug-prone,” the judge wrote. After Mr. Ventura was arrested for trespassing, a second officer discovered the cocaine. But in her ruling, Justice Torres wrote: “No matter the location, luxurious or modest, the police must have ‘some objective credible reason,’ to request information about a person’s residency. Officers conducting vertical patrols are not permitted to select individuals for questioning based on presence alone.” A large volume of all the street stops police officers make in New York are for trespassing, according to an analysis of police data by The New York Times. Officers cited a suspicion of trespassing 369,000 times from 2003 through March 2010, or 12 percent of all stops. But in precincts with large clusters of public housing, up to 30 percent of stops were conducted on suspicion of trespassing. Critics say the trespassing stops are largely unwarranted. Indeed, the analysis by The Times showed that trespassing stops were far more likely than most stops to result in nothing more than an inconvenient delay. Few moved beyond the questioning stage. Two percent of stops where trespassing was suspected — about 7,000 — yielded drugs or other contraband. A total of 81 trespassing stops yielded a gun. Fundamentally, when officers stop people to question them, they are supposed to record both a reason for the stop — like the person’s having a weaponlike bulge in his pocket — and the crime that the person is suspected of having committed. But among all trespassing stops from 2003 through March 2010, two-thirds — more than 257,000 — listed only the vague category of “other” or “furtive movements” as the reason for the stop. In a majority of those cases, the officers indicated that the stop took place in a high-crime area, which would satisfy what Justice Torres said the police needed as a minimum threshold to make a trespassing stop. Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman, said the judge’s decision was “not a setback” because it was consistent with new housing vertical patrol, procedures and training curriculum put in place this year. Before making a trespass arrest, Mr. Browne said, officers are trained to ask a person: Do you live in the building? Are you visiting someone? Do you have business there? Based on the answers, and on follow-up questions, an officer might establish probable cause for an arrest, or might tell the person to leave or become satisfied that he or she can stay. “Housing officers are trained that they must establish a reason to approach someone before questioning individuals in a housing development — for example, violations of Housing Authority rules and regulations,” Mr. Browne said. “Furthermore, the judge said the officer in the Ventura case did not adequately establish reasonable suspicion or properly articulate probable cause for a trespassing arrest.” Mr. Browne said the department’s new guidelines and training grew out of meetings with tenants’ organizations and the city Housing Authority, and did not suggest that officers’ behavior in patrolling public housing prior to the new rules was faulty. A spokeswoman for Bridget G. Brennan, the special narcotics prosecutor, said the judge’s decision was narrow and “we’re not concerned that it has any precedential value.” But Steven Banks, attorney-in-chief at the Legal Aid Society, said that what Officer Del Toro “candidly admitted” in his testimony is a “serious daily occurrence.” He said it encapsulated what had led his agency, the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc., and a private law firm to file a federal lawsuit against the city.",

    "source": "Braves Clinch Wild-Card Spot in N.L. <eos> As the baseball season moves into its final stretch, the story lines are becoming clearer. Three National League teams — San Francisco, Cincinnati and Washington — have clinched spots in the postseason, and Atlanta joined them as a wild-card team with a win Tuesday. That left St. Louis fighting off Milwaukee and the Dodgers for the second wild-card slot. The American League is more complicated. No team has clinched a postseason spot, although TEXAS started the day with a five-game lead in the West. The Yankees and Baltimore continued to cling to each other in the East, and Detroit beat Kansas City to pull even with the White Sox, who lost to Cleveland, in the Central. (NYT) BRAVES 4, MARLINS 3 Freddie Freeman hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth to put host Atlanta back in the playoffs. Freeman’s dramatic drive off Mike Dunn clinched at least a wild-card berth for the Braves, who squandered a big lead in the wild-card race with a huge collapse last September. Chipper Jones, who plans to retire at the end of the season, led off the ninth with a double. He moved to third on a wild pitch by Dunn (0-3) and scored on Freeman’s 22nd home run. “Last year was somewhat of a fluke,” Jones said. (AP) REDS 4, BREWERS 2 Johnny Cueto pitched seven solid innings and host Cincinnati stayed in the chase for the N.L.’s top record after learning it will be without its manager for the rest of the week. Manager Dusty Baker met his players before the game and revealed he sustained a ministroke in addition to being treated for an irregular heartbeat at a Chicago hospital last week. The bench coach Chris Speier will manage the Reds until Baker returns for the playoffs. (AP) CARDINALS 4, ASTROS 0 Jaime Garcia pitched seven sharp innings at Houston to help St. Louis improve its playoff chances. The Cardinals won their fourth straight and moved four and a half games ahead of Milwaukee in the race for the second N.L. wild card. The Dodgers, who played later, dropped four games behind the Cardinals. (AP) PHILLIES 6, NATIONALS 3 Darin Ruf homered for his first major league hit, Carlos Ruiz and Domonic Brown also went deep and host Philadelphia beat playoff-bound Washington. Philadelphia remained five and a half games behind St. Louis for the N.L.’s second wild card. (AP) INDIANS 4, WHITE SOX 3 Chicago gave Detroit an opening to tie for the A.L. Central lead when Gordon Beckham hit into a game-ending forceout with the tying run on second against last-place Cleveland. The White Sox have lost six of seven and have had trouble scoring without homers lately. Three solo home runs were all the offense Chicago mustered. Behind by 4-0, the White Sox rallied when A. J. Pierzynski and Dayan Viciedo hit consecutive fifth-inning home runs off Corey Kluber (2-4). They pulled to a run behind when Paul Konerko homered off Chris Perez leading off the ninth. Perez then walked two batters with two outs, and Beckham grounded to shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera, who threw to second baseman Jason Kipnis for a force. “It’s just going to take some hits together that don’t go over the fence,” Beckham said. Chicago had held sole possession of the division lead since Sept. 3, but Detroit pulled even when it beat Kansas City. (AP) TIGERS 2, ROYALS 0 Anibal Sanchez threw his first shutout in more than a year for host Detroit. Sanchez (4-6) retired the first 11 hitters and allowed only three hits. He struck out 10 and walked 1, throwing 105 pitches. (AP) ATHLETICS 3, RANGERS 2 George Kottaras hit a leadoff homer in the 10th inning and visiting Oakland cut Texas’s A.L. West lead to four games. The A’s began the day two games ahead of the Angels for the second A.L. wild-card spot. The Angels played later against Seattle. (AP) RAYS 5, RED SOX 2 David Price struck out a season-high 13 as Tampa Bay beat Boston. (AP) NO PLAYOFFS FOR CABRERA The San Francisco Giants said they had no plans to bring back the suspended outfielder Melky Cabrera during the postseason if the club is still playing when he is eligible to return.

    "source": "South Korea Searches for Survivors of Sunken Navy Ship <eos> The South Korean Navy continued its search for survivors of a sunken patrol ship in waters near the disputed western maritime border with North Korea on Sunday. Hopes were dimming for 46 missing sailors, and the mystery of what caused their ship to break in half in a blast and sink Friday evening remained unresolved. South Korea ’s president, Lee Myung-bak, called emergency security meetings and ordered an investigation into the sinking. Fierce waves hampered efforts to examine the 1,200-ton corvette Cheonan underwater or find more survivors until weather improved on Sunday. No new survivors, nor any bodies, have been found since 58 of the ship’s 104 sailors were plucked alive on Friday evening. Relatives of the missing sailed overnight aboard a military ship, arriving at the scene of the sinking on Sunday. “I heard a terrible explosion and the ship keeled suddenly to the right. We lost power and telecommunications,” Choi Won-il, captain of the Cheonan, told the relatives. “I was trapped in the cabin for five minutes before my colleagues broke the window in and let me out. When I got out, the stern had already broken away and disappeared underwater.” Most of those missing were believed to have been trapped inside their rapidly sinking ship as waters gushed into their dark under deck, officials said. “Many sailors were hanging onto the bow of the sinking ship,” Kim Jin-ho, a crewman on a civilian ferry to Baengnyeong, a South Korean border island, told YTN television, describing the rescue scene on Friday night. “They were shouting for help. They were falling into water.” The sinking of the ship near the disputed sea border, where the navies of the two Koreas have fought bloody skirmishes, raised the possibility of a North Korean torpedo attack or sabotage. The South Korean defense minister, Kim Tae-young, told Parliament that the authorities would investigate such a possibility but emphasized that it was too early to connect the sinking to North Korea. The corvette was on a routine patrol mission in the Yellow Sea when it sunk near Baengnyeong, 10 miles from the North Korean coast and 120 miles from the South Korean mainland. The sinking is one of South Korea’s worst peacetime naval disasters. In 1974, a navy landing ship capsized off the south coast in stormy weather, killing 159 sailors and coast guard personnel. In 1967, 39 sailors were killed when North Korean shore guns pounded a South Korean Navy ship off the east coast. Military accidents receive special scrutiny here. North and South Korea are still in an official state of war. All eligible South Korean men must serve in the military. The waters in the disputed western sea near the two Koreas make up the most volatile section of the border. North Korea rejects a maritime demarcation line drawn by the United Nations at the end of the war. The two sides engaged in naval clashes in 1999 and 2002. In November, naval patrol boats from the North and South exchanged fire after a North Korean boat crossed the disputed sea border.",

    "source": "Angels Continue Turnaround With Sweep of the Athletics <eos> OAKLAND, Calif. Torii Hunter played cards on Wednesday morning, and then studied video in the Los Angeles Angels ’ clubhouse at the Coliseum. When it was time for indoor batting practice, Hunter was all business. Normally chatty, he had little interest in analyzing his team’s well-timed hot streak. “The past don’t even matter,” Hunter said. “We won those games already. It’s all about today, that’s it. We’re fine, man, we’re playing well. Stick with it. One last push.” Two hours later, in the top of the third inning of a scoreless game, Hunter came to bat against the Oakland Athletics with two out and a runner on third. He fell behind in the count but lashed a single to right to give the Angels their first lead. They never looked back in a 7-1 victory , completing a sweep of an Oakland team that had won nine games in a row. “We needed it bad,” said starter Dan Haren, who worked six strong innings. “We knew we had to get all three. Our will to win these last three games has been just different than it’s been the rest of the year. We were loud on our bench. The offense did the job, and the starting pitching has been better this whole time.” The rotation was supposed to be a pillar for the Angels, especially after they traded for Zack Greinke in late July. Instead, the starters sagged for weeks, dragging the team below the Texas Rangers and the A’s in the American League West standings. On Aug. 21, though, the Angels met their match in misery. As badly as they had underachieved — with a 62-60 record — the Boston Red Sox were much worse. The Angels swept their three games at Fenway Park and are 12-3 since the start of that series. In that stretch, their starters are 10-2 with a 3.18 earned run average. “If we were going to continue to struggle and not control the game on the mound the way we can, we had no chance,” Manager Mike Scioscia said after Greinke stifled the A’s here on Tuesday. “So the fact that some guys turned it around, the fact that Zack came in and is pitching to his capabilities, gives us reason to be optimistic that we’re going play at a high level and hopefully play well enough to get into the playoffs.” The Angels (74-63) are two and a half games behind Oakland for one of the two A.L. wild card spots, and they may have to get by for a bit without their ace, Jered Weaver, who took a liner off his shoulder Sunday and has not thrown since. Weaver left the team on Wednesday to have the shoulder examined. A team that spent lavishly last winter to sign first baseman Albert Pujols and starter C. J. Wilson — and that has had extraordinary performance from the rookie center fielder Mike Trout — has no time to waste. “When you start getting into the twenties of games left, there’s just a limited amount of games you can lose,” Haren said. “There’s a different sense of urgency when the games start dwindling and we have ground to gain.” The teams and the crowd put that aside for a few tense minutes in the fourth inning on Wednesday, when Erick Aybar smashed a line drive off the side of Oakland starter Brandon McCarthy’s head. McCarthy fell, the back of his head slamming the ground, and then he sat dazed by the edge of the mound. He left the game — walking off the mound on his own — and was taken to a hospital. The A’s said he did not lose consciousness. “You never want to see anything like that happen, no matter when it is,” Haren said. “It doesn’t matter if it’s the last game of the year and we’re tied.” McCarthy was the opening day starter for Oakland, a role Haren once held. He pitched three seasons for the Athletics and started their last playoff game, in 2006. He had a bobblehead of a former teammate, Scott Hatteberg, in his locker Wednesday, and his former manager with the St. Louis Cardinals, Tony La Russa, was a guest in the Angels’ clubhouse after the game. La Russa, who is retired and lives nearby, elbowed his way into Scioscia’s postgame session with reporters. “I was second-guessing you left and right,” he told Scioscia, and he might not have been joking. With one out, two on and a 3-1 lead in the seventh inning, Scioscia summoned Nick Maronde from the bullpen. Maronde had faced just one batter above Class AA, recording a strikeout in Seattle on Sunday, but he fanned Coco Crisp and Seth Smith to survive the jam. Josh Reddick also struck out to start the next inning, and Maronde left the game, preserving his perfect major league line: four batters faced, four strikeouts. Maronde turned 23 on Wednesday and said the whole experience had been surreal. He guessed that this was the first time he had ever pitched on his birthday. “That’s kind of the icing on the cake,” he said. Hunter, who drove in two more runs with a single in the ninth, said he did not know it was Maronde’s birthday and would get him something on the flight home. It figured to be a relaxing flight, a break in a desperate pennant drive. “We know we have a pretty good ball club — a really good ball club — and we want to show it,” Hunter said. “We’re doing it right now.”",

    "source": "After Ground Zero Prayer, Pope Ministers to 60,000 in Stadium <eos> Before a crowd of nearly 60,000 people at Yankee Stadium, Pope Benedict XVI on Sunday ended his first visit to the United States as leader of the Roman Catholic Church with a reminder to the faithful that “obedience” to the authority of the church, even in a country that prizes individual freedom, is the foundation of their religious faith. During a six-day visit to Washington and New York, the pope addressed world issues, visited a synagogue and voiced deep shame over the child sexual abuse scandal that has damaged the church’s standing in many American dioceses. At a morning ceremony at ground zero, the pope blessed the World Trade Center site, where more than 2,700 people were killed in the terrorist attack, and prayed for peace. But at Yankee Stadium on a cool, brilliant Sunday afternoon, with an adoring audience of people waving yellow cloths, one of the colors of the Vatican, Benedict acted chiefly as pastor to America’s 65 million Catholics, laying out in simple terms their obligations to a church that represents what he has called the “one church” established on earth by God. “Authority. Obedience. To be frank, these are not easy words to speak nowadays,” the pope said in his homily during the Mass, held on an acre-size platform built over the Yankees infield, “especially in a society which rightly places a high value on personal freedom.” Three years after the death of Pope John Paul II, his popular and charismatic predecessor, the reserved and theologically erudite Pope Benedict XVI gently but unequivocally delineated the source of authority that has since devolved to him, and that he said was integral to the church itself. Referring to himself, he said, “The presence around this altar of the successor of Peter, his brother bishops and priests, and deacons, men and women religious, and lay faithful from throughout the 50 states of the union, eloquently manifests our communion in the Catholic faith, which comes to us from the apostles.” In the Gospels, the Apostle Peter was chosen by Jesus to lead the church, and each pope is said to be the successor of Peter. In a glancing reference to the sexual abuse of children by priests, he said that praying for the kingdom of God “means not losing heart in the face of adversity, resistance and scandal. It means overcoming every separation between faith and life, and countering false gospels of freedom and happiness.” In his writings before and since becoming pope, Benedict has stressed the importance of a strict adherence to orthodoxy, and opposition to a wide array of modern cultural trends, including feminism, gay rights, and demands — especially among American Catholics — for greater democracy and administrative transparency within the church. The Mass at Yankee Stadium was the largest public event of the pope’s tour, and it was held on the same day as the most intimate meeting of his visit. In his stop at ground zero on Sunday morning, the pope spoke briefly with a small group of survivors and families of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack. Cardinal Edward M. Egan of New York stood beside him and read each one’s name and gave the pope a brief description of the family member lost by the person. Some took the pope’s hand, and many knelt and kissed his ring, the traditional protocol for Roman Catholics. For those not invited to meet personally with Benedict or able to get one of the scarce event tickets, there were the untold number of TVs tuned in to the various events of the week. There were six wide screens at Billy’s Sports Bar on River Avenue in the Bronx, where Mike Gonzale, 29, of Woodside, Queens, sat watching as the pope said Mass on Sunday at the stadium across the street. “You feel an energy; you feel a peace,” Mr. Gonzale said, speaking softly, like a golf commentator, as he watched the television. “I think most people feel a calm relief from the complicated world we’re living in.” Inside the packed stadium, the energy was palpable, the stands a solid wall of blurring yellow cloths and cheering. After the Mass, waves of excitement followed the path of the pope as he first walked, and then rode in his Popemobile, around the outside track of the field. Surrounded by black-suited Secret Service men as he walked, the 81-year-old pontiff moved somewhat haltingly, the papal scepter in his left hand. He waved gingerly with his right hand. The crowd roared with all the sustained excitement of spectators at a pennant-clinching game. The next and final stop for the pope was Kennedy Airport, where Vice President Dick Cheney led a ceremony before the pontiff’s return trip to Rome. Many of the people interviewed after Sunday’s Mass said they were deeply moved to be in the presence of Christ’s vicar on earth, as the pope is known to believers. His role as a spiritual father figure can seem to be almost personal for some Catholics. “The most amazing part was when he came in the Popemobile,” said Sylvia Rios, 45, who attended the Mass with her former husband, Jesus Matthews, 46. “I know he wasn’t waving at me, but we had good seats, and when I looked at him, he looked like he was waving specifically at me.” But more, people at the Mass said it was thrilling to be in a state of religious communion with so many others — and while in the presence of the pope, who represents the founding of the church 2,000 years ago. Christa Rivers-Caceres, 37, who drove from Bushkill, Pa., with her husband, Enrique, 32, said being at Yankee Stadium made her feel like part of the family of Catholics, who number more than one billion worldwide. “You were proud to be Catholic,” she said. “It helped reaffirm our faith.” Efrem Menghs, a phone company salesman from Columbus, Ohio, said the experience had made him a better person. “I will look back and say I’m glad I came to this event,” he said. “I did something for God.”",

    "source": "Olympus Investigation Shows Ethical Lapses and a Caterer With Clout <eos> TOKYO — Managers at an Olympus factory in southern China struggled for years to resolve a thorny dispute with local customs authorities. The problem risked incurring millions of dollars in fines and harming a crucial manufacturing hub that churned out 50 million camera lenses a year. Then Olympus found an unlikely helper: an obscure Chinese company that ran the factory’s cafeteria. The caterer had connections. In 2013, Olympus hired the company, Anyuan, to be a fixer, acting as a go-between with government officials in the customs case, according to an internal investigation into the matter. Soon after, the eight-year-old case was inexplicably dropped, and with it demands that Olympus pay at least $9 million in penalties and uncollected import duties. The activities in China, laid bare in a confidential 57-page report on the investigation, as well as internal memos and emails that were reviewed by The New York Times, exposed a series of ethical lapses and a corporate culture undermined by weak oversight. The documents said there was a nearly $700 million bookkeeping discrepancy, dubious real estate deals, “top secret” emails and a hidden “slush fund.” While Olympus found no legal violations in its investigation, the previously unreported documents detailed “sloppy due diligence,” “major problems” with corporate controls and instances where Olympus managers “concealed” payments to Anyuan. Olympus’s dealings with a shadowy middleman took place just two years after it faced a major ethical crisis, admitting in 2011 to a $1.7 billion accounting fraud . Those failings stretched to the top, and senior executives eventually pleaded guilty to hiding huge investment losses for decades. Afterward, the company overhauled the senior management team , vowing to change its ways. That pledge makes the company’s activities in China all the more glaring, since they did not involve the old guard. They were approved by its new leadership, including the president and the chairman. Senior executives signed off on millions of dollars in payments to the Chinese company, according to the internal investigation. And they did so despite the knowledge that Anyuan’s chairman was linked to prominent bribery cases that were reported by China’s state-run media. Some Olympus executives, the report said, understood that Chinese fixers “could commit bribery.” The situation in China has drawn attention from the authorities in the United States. Olympus briefed the Justice Department on the results of its internal inquiry. The Justice Department’s foreign corporate bribery unit is monitoring developments, though it has not opened a formal investigation, according to an American official with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it. Olympus is on the department’s radar for the 2011 accounting fraud, which involved financial transactions in the United States, as well as a separate investigation into accusations that Olympus paid kickbacks to doctors in order to sell medical equipment. Olympus paid $623 million to settle the medical equipment case and admitted wrongdoing in the matter. Olympus acknowledged an investigation into its Chinese operations, which was conducted by three board members and a law professor, with assistance from outside law firms. But the company declined to elaborate, saying that the inquiry had found no evidence of legal violations. A spokesman for the company, Osamu Kobayashi, said of details described in internal documents: “We don’t deny them, and we don’t confirm them.” Image The Olympus campus in Shenzhen, China, which can produce millions of camera lenses a year. Credit Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times The company, which presented the findings of the China investigation to the board late last year, has taken some action. In February, Olympus quietly disciplined five managers who were directly involved in dealings with Anyuan. Two were demoted, one received a two-day suspension and two others received written reprimands. Olympus announced the actions on an internal notice board accessible by employees, without giving reasons. The inquiry’s report recommended that the same managers be punished for violating company policies, although it said their actions fell short of legal wrongdoing. Mr. Kobayashi, the spokesman, called the actions an internal human resources matter and declined to comment further. Anyuan declined to comment. The company operates out of a building with a polished stone lobby in Shenzhen, an industrial city on the Chinese mainland a few miles from Hong Kong, where Olympus has its camera factory. In response to a visit by a reporter, a receptionist said the chairman, Chen Zuyuan was away. The company did not respond to multiple requests for interviews with Mr. Chen or other representatives. Anyuan did not cooperate with the Olympus inquiry, the investigators said in their report, beyond giving a short statement claiming it had “used only legal means” to aid Olympus with the customs issue. Fixing More Than Lunch Olympus built its first plant in Shenzhen in the early 1990s, at a time when global companies were piling into China’s rapidly developing coastal cities, looking to take advantage of the cheap labor force. It expanded a decade later, after the Chinese government set up a duty-free zone for overseas manufacturers in the city. Soon, Shenzhen became the source of most lenses that Olympus uses in its cameras. The plant, which employed several thousand workers, could produce more than 50 million lenses a year, as well as other camera components. The expansion in Shenzhen was not trouble-free. In 2011, fire inspectors found safety violations at the factory, including faults with “emergency passages, smoke ventilation, doors and windows,” two managers later wrote in a memo. Image The Olympus factory in Shenzhen, an industrial city on the Chinese mainland a few miles from Hong Kong. Credit Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times It was then that Chinese public security officials introduced Olympus to Anyuan, according to one of the memos reviewed by The Times. The officials said that Anyuan could facilitate “a smooth resolution” to the fire-safety problem, the managers wrote. In China, such middlemen have played an invaluable, if sometimes dubious, role for overseas companies. Government officials hold significant sway over the Chinese economy, requiring companies to navigate a labyrinth of bureaucratic approvals and regulations to secure access, orders and licenses, or negotiate taxes and fees. Often operating out of view, the middlemen, who have connections to government and Communist Party officials, can help lubricate the process. Managers at Olympus described Anyuan in the internal memos as an influential fixer, with vaguely defined interests in a variety of industries like construction, mining and pharmaceuticals. Most important, they said, the company could be counted on to solve problems with Chinese officials, by using what they called “strong connections with the central government, the city and the security services.” The managers agreed to let Anyuan deal with the fire inspectors on Olympus’s behalf, multiple Olympus documents show. They later reported that, as a result of Anyuan’s intervention, the factory was certified as safe “without any fines or line stoppages whatsoever.” Olympus declined to comment on the matter. Olympus turned to Anyuan for help, despite hints of impropriety. In 2007, state-controlled media reported that Anyuan’s chairman, Mr. Chen, paid a senior transportation official in Yunnan Province 32 million renminbi, or $4.9 million, to obtain roadway-related contracts — an amount one news report described as the largest bribe ever paid to a Chinese public official. The official, Hu Xing, was arrested in Singapore and extradited to China, where he was sentenced to life in prison for taking bribes. Mr. Chen has also been connected to a more recent corruption case involving Wan Qingliang, the former Communist Party chief of Guangzhou, one of China’s wealthiest and most populous cities and a close neighbor to Shenzhen. The official, who was arrested in 2014, faces charges that he took 111 million renminbi, or $17.2 million, in bribes from Mr. Chen and other businessmen, the official Xinhua news agency reported in December. (It was unclear whether Mr. Chen of Anyuan has been charged with wrongdoing in either bribery case.) For its help with the fire-safety problem, Anyuan requested an unusual form of payment. In October 2011, Olympus hired an Anyuan-affiliated company as a contractor at the factory, according to multiple Olympus documents. The affiliate’s official job was to to provide catering, cleaning and security services to the employee cafeteria. But the affiliate, called An Ping Tai, was established just three days before it took on the contract, and it listed a nonexistent office as its address, the internal inquiry found. The affiliate appeared to exist only on paper. “An Ping Tai seems to be a shell company without substantial operations,” lawyers at a Western law firm said in a confidential report prepared for Olympus in 2014, before the company decided to open a formal inquiry. According to the internal investigation, Olympus paid the affiliate at least 1.2 million renminbi, or about $180,000, in several upfront payments, followed by unspecified monthly service fees and other compensation. Some of the money was drawn from what the inquiry called a “slush fund” that was hidden from Olympus’s official accounts. Image Workers at the Olympus factory in Shenzhen, China. Credit Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times Olympus made other off-the-books payments to Anyuan, the internal inquiry found. In 2014, managers in Shenzhen diverted to An Ping Tai rent money that Olympus had collected from employees who lived in company dormitories. The managers then “covered up” the payments by describing them in financial reports as maintenance fees, the inquiry found. The $694 Million Discrepancy The customs dispute at Olympus stretched back to 2006, when inspectors in Shenzhen found discrepancies with the factory’s inventory records, according to the internal inquiry and managers’ memos reviewed by The Times. Foreign companies in the city’s special manufacturing zone are allowed to import duty-free raw materials on the condition that the products they assemble there are exported to other countries. They must not be sold in China, where they would compete unfairly with local goods. The customs inspectors discovered that the volume of materials that Olympus was importing into the zone did not match the finished components that it was shipping out. Such discrepancies can indicate that a company is violating the no-selling-in-China rule. The value of the discrepancy, $694 million, was so large that Olympus said it could only be explained by data-entry error. By way of comparison, Olympus sold only about $600 million worth of digital cameras worldwide last year. The internal inquiry blamed the problem on “simple operational mistakes” by workers logging inventory in record-keeping software. The customs authorities were unpersuaded. After years of back-and-forth with Olympus, officials threatened to levy at least 60 million renminbi, or $9.2 million, in fines and unpaid import tariffs, according the Olympus documents. In one memo, managers in Shenzhen said the fine could end up being 40 times as large, though the Western law firm’s report questioned the legal basis for that estimate in its 2014 report. Customs authorities in Shenzhen declined to comment. The General Administration of Customs in Beijing, which oversees customs affairs nationally, said it did not comment on investigations. Managers also suggested in the memo that Olympus could lose its duty-free trading privileges in Shenzhen, a blow that would add costs to the already unprofitable camera business. Global digital camera sales have plunged by half in the last decade, hurt by the spread of camera-equipped smartphones. Olympus employees had previously tried to curry favor with Chinese officials, the inquiry’s report suggested. Investigators found a proposal by a Chinese employee at the plant dated August 2011 to offer cash and cameras worth 20,000 renminbi, or about $3,000, to the head of the customs office’s antismuggling department. The report does not make clear if the plan was approved or carried out. Image The Olympus president Shuichi Takayama, left, and Nobuyuki Onishi, an accounting executive, briefed reporters on a scandal in 2011. Credit Franck Robichon/European Pressphoto Agency Anyuan proposed a more decisive intervention. The company told Olympus that it could resolve the problem quickly and relatively cheaply, the Shenzhen managers reported in mid-2013. Anyuan, they said, estimated it would cost Olympus half the amount that the customs authorities were threatening to impose in penalties. It was still a significant payment — equivalent to several million dollars. One manager in Shenzhen, the head of the accounting department at the factory, told the company inquiry that he suspected Anyuan would use part of the money to bribe Chinese officials. Discussions with Anyuan were handled by a Chinese Olympus employee, according to the inquiry. “My interpretation at the time, and still a possible interpretation now,” the accounting manager is quoted in the inquiry’s report as saying, was that the Chinese employee “was negotiating to deliver 100 million to 140 million renminbi in bribes to the government through Anyuan.” The confidential inquiry said there was no documentary evidence to prove the manager’s claim. Other managers told investigators they had no reason to think Anyuan was bribing Chinese officials. Once again, the plan involved an unorthodox form of payment. Olympus, the documents show, proposed a real estate transaction. Olympus would sell two dormitory buildings in Shenzhen to the Anyuan affiliate. The sale price would be set well below the buildings’ market value, according to the confidential report from the Western law firm. The deal would reward Anyuan, but more discreetly than a cash payment. Senior Olympus executives would have to sign off, and they were nervous. The reports and memos showed a debate ensued between Tokyo executives and the Asia-Pacific office, based in Hong Kong, over who would bear responsibility for the decision. Executives knew about the bribery accusations against Mr. Chen and were concerned about legal risks, according to the documents. At one point, the Olympus president, Hiroyuki Sasa; chairman, Yasuyuki Kimoto, who retired last year; and two other board members in Tokyo told subordinates in Hong Kong and Shenzhen to move forward with the real estate deal, according to the report by the Western law firm. Managers in Shenzhen were instructed “not to leave any written evidence of the purpose behind the transaction,” the law firm found. Email memos on the matter were labeled “top secret.” There are conflicting accounts of what happened next. According to the inquiry, Olympus balked at the dormitory sale at the last minute, judging it too risky. But managers in Shenzhen had already signed a deal, which Anyuan claimed contained clauses promising the sale. In the end, Olympus paid Anyuan 24 million renminbi, or $3.7 million, in cash, through its affiliate An Ping Tai, according the inquiry. Olympus declined to comment on details of its arrangement with Anyuan, beyond saying it was “one of many contractual relationships” it maintained in the normal course of its business. In August 2014, eight months after its managers signed the deal with Anyuan, Olympus was informed that it would not be fined or otherwise punished for the inventory-recording discrepancy, according to the inquiry. “In the end, a fine that had been estimated at least 60 million renminbi was not levied at all,” the inquiry found.",

(AP) — Circuit City Stores posted a wider quarterly loss and withdrew its fiscal 2009 outlook Monday amid sluggish sales, poor traffic and heightened competition. Circuit City, which ranks behind Best Buy among the nation’s consumer electronics retailers, said it lost $239.2 million, or $1.45 a share, compared with a loss of $62.8 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales in the period, which ended Aug. 31 and was the second quarter if Circuit City’s fiscal year, declined 10 percent, to $2.39 billion, from $2.64 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 13.3 percent. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a loss of $1.04 a share and $2.53 billion in sales. Circuit City’s stock fell 29 cents, or 21 percent, to $1.08 a share. “We realize the performance of this company is unacceptable to all of our stakeholders and that it is imperative that we take the right steps to accelerate our turnaround,” James A. Marcum, the acting chief executive, said in a conference call with investors. Mr. Marcum was named vice chairman and acting president and chief executive last week after the resignation of Philip J. Schoonover, who had been under fire for the last year as financial results weakened. “We must get back to the basics and, make no mistake, this is all about our customers,” Mr. Marcum said. The company also said it was “prudent” to withdraw its previous outlook for fiscal 2009 and suspended store openings beginning with fiscal 2010. In the second quarter, Circuit City’s video sales fell by nearly 10 percent as flat-panel televisions rose slightly, but not enough to offset a sharper decline in tube and projection televisions. Sales of camcorders and DVD hardware fell by more than 10 percent.",

    "source": "More Iraqis Said to Flee Since Troop Increase <eos> BAGHDAD, Aug. 23 — The number of Iraqis fleeing their homes has soared since the American troop increase began in February, according to data from two humanitarian groups, accelerating the partition of the country into sectarian enclaves. Despite some evidence that the troop buildup has improved security in certain areas, sectarian violence continues and American-led operations have brought new fighting, driving fearful Iraqis from their homes at much higher rates than before the tens of thousands of additional troops arrived, the studies show. The data track what are known as internally displaced Iraqis: those who have been driven from their neighborhoods and seek refuge elsewhere in the country rather than fleeing across the border. The effect of this vast migration is to drain religiously mixed areas in the center of Iraq , sending Shiite refugees toward the overwhelmingly Shiite areas to the south and Sunnis toward majority Sunni regions to the west and north. Though most displaced Iraqis say they would like to return, there is little prospect of their doing so. One Sunni Arab who had been driven out of the Baghdad neighborhood of southern Dora by Shiite snipers said she doubted that her family would ever return, buildup or no buildup. “There is no way we would go back,” said the woman, 26, who gave her name only as Aswaidi. “It is a city of ghosts. The only people left there are terrorists.” Statistics collected by one of the two humanitarian groups, the Iraqi Red Crescent Organization, indicate that the total number of internally displaced Iraqis has more than doubled, to 1.1 million from 499,000, since the buildup started in February. Those figures are broadly consistent with data compiled by an independent agency that specializes in tracking wide-scale dislocations. That agency, the International Organization for Migration, found that in recent months the rate of displacement in Baghdad, where the buildup is focused, had increased by as much as a factor of 20, although part of that rise could have stemmed from improved monitoring of displaced Iraqis by the government in Baghdad, the capital. The new findings suggest that while sectarian attacks have declined in some neighborhoods, the influx of troops and the intense fighting they have brought are at least partly responsible for what a report by the United Nations migration office calls the worst human displacement in Iraq’s modern history. The findings also indicate that the sectarian tension the troops were meant to defuse is still intense in many places in Iraq. Sixty-three percent of the Iraqis surveyed by the United Nations said they had fled their neighborhoods because of direct threats to their lives, and more than 25 percent because they had been forcibly removed from their homes. The demographic shifts could favor those who would like to see Iraq partitioned into three semi-autonomous regions: a Shiite south and a Kurdish north sandwiching a Sunni territory. Over all, the scale of this migration has put so much strain on Iraqi governmental and relief offices that some provinces have refused to register any more displaced people, or will accept only those whose families are originally from the area. But Rafiq Tschannen, chief of the Iraq mission for the migration office, said that in many cases, the ability of extended families to absorb displaced relatives was also stretched to the breaking point. “It’s a bleak picture,” Mr. Tschannen said. “It is just steadily continuing in a bad direction, from bad to worse.” He also cautioned that reports of people going back to their homes were overstated. As the buildup began, the Iraqi government said that it would take measures to evict squatters from houses that were not theirs and make special efforts to bring the rightful owners back. “They were reporting that people went back, but they didn’t report that people left again,” Mr. Tschannen said. He added that Iraqis “hear things are better, go back to collect remuneration and pick up an additional suitcase and leave again. It is not a permanent return in most cases.” American officials in Baghdad did not respond to a request for comment, but the national intelligence estimate released Thursday confirmed that Iraq continues to become more segregated through internal migration. “Population displacement resulting from sectarian violence continues,” it found, “imposing burdens on provincial governments and some neighboring states.” Dr. Said Hakki, director of the Iraqi Red Crescent Organization, said that he had been surprised when his figures revealed that roughly 100,000 people a month were fleeing their homes during the buildup. Dr. Hakki said that he did not know why the rates were so high but added that some factors were obvious. “It’s fear,” he said. “Lack of services. You see, if you have a security problem, you don’t need a lot to frighten people.” It is clear that military operations, both by American troops and the Iraqi forces working with them as part of the buildup, have something to do with the rise in displacement, said Dana Graber Ladek, Iraq displacement specialist for the migration organization’s Iraq office. “If a surge means that soldiers are on the streets patrolling to make sure there is no violence, that is one thing,” Ms. Ladek said. “If a surge means military operations where there are attacks and bombings, then obviously that is going to create displacement.” But Ms. Ladek added that, in contrast to the first years of the conflict, when major American offensives were a main cause of displacement, the primary driving force had changed. “Sectarian violence is the biggest driving factor — militias coming into a neighborhood and kicking all the Sunnis out, or insurgents driving all the Shias away,” Ms. Ladek said. Her conclusions mirrored the experiences of Iraqis who had fled their homes. Aswaidi and her family were driven out of the Dora section of Baghdad five months ago when Shiite snipers opened fire on their Sunni neighborhood from nearby tower blocks, shooting through their windows “at all hours of day and night.” Returning covertly to check on the property in mid-August, she found Sunni insurgents occupying the building and neighboring homes, walking unchallenged through the deserted streets. Nearby, she claims, the same insurgents captured one of the Shiite snipers who drove the residents away, and claimed that he was a 16-year-old Iranian. She now fears that her entire neighborhood will be taken over by Shiite militias like the Mahdi Army, which is loyal to the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr. “I don’t want them to take my town, but I think they will,” Aswaidi said. “It will change from Sunni to Shia. The Americans can’t stop it.” Shiites face similarly overwhelming odds. In Shualah, on the northern outskirts of Baghdad, 400 Shiite families now live in a makeshift refugee camp on wasteland commandeered by Mr. Sadr’s followers. In a sprawl of cinder block hovels and tin and bamboo-roofed shacks, families have stories of being expelled from their homes by Sunni insurgents. Ali Edan fled Yusifiya, a Sunni insurgent haven south of Baghdad, when his uncle was killed. He has no intention of returning, even though American commanders claim Sunni sheiks there have begun cooperating with them. “It is still an unsafe area,” said Mr. Edan. Both humanitarian groups based their conclusions on information collected from the displaced Iraqis inside the country. The Red Crescent counted only displaced Iraqis who receive relief supplies, and the United Nations relied on data from an Iraqi ministry that closely tracks Iraqis who leave their homes and register for government services elsewhere. Before the troop buildup, by far the most significant event causing the displacement of Iraqis was the bombing of a revered Shiite mosque in Samarra in February 2006. The bombing set off a spasm of sectarian killing, but the rate at which Iraqis left their homes leveled off toward the end of that year before accelerating again as the buildup began, the Red Crescent figures show. The United Nations figures also include a little over a million people it says were displaced in the decades before the Samarra bombing, including the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. The Red Crescent data does not include them. In Baghdad, the latest migration involves an enormously complex landscape in which some people flee one district even as others return to it. In Ghazaliya, a mixed but Sunni-majority district of north Baghdad, one 30-year-old Shiite said his family was driven out by Sunni insurgents a year ago with just two hours notice to leave their home. Five months ago, the troop buildup brought American soldiers and the Shiite-dominated Iraqi Army onto his street and his family returned. But even as it did, Sunni neighbors fled, knowing that the army had been infiltrated by Shiite militias. “They are afraid, because the army has good relations with the Mahdi Army,” said the 30-year-old man, who said he was too afraid to give his name. “My area used to have a lot of Sunni. Now most are Shia, because Shias expelled from other places have moved into the empty Sunni homes.”",

    "source": "AARP Orders Investigation Concerning Its Marketing <eos> WASHINGTON — After a Senate inquiry found evidence of deceptive marketing, AARP , the lobby for older Americans, has hired an outside investigator to look into sales of some of its popular health insurance products. AARP and UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation’s largest insurers, have voluntarily suspended sales of the policies, which pay fixed cash benefits — often much less than consumers had expected — for selected services. The investigation will be conducted by Elizabeth Rowe Costle, who was the insurance commissioner of Vermont from 1992 to 2003, when Howard Dean was governor. At issue are insurance plans that were sold by UnitedHealth and carry the AARP brand. More than a million people have bought the policies, which have names like AARP Medical Advantage, Essential Plus and Hospital Indemnity Plan. The senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, said marketing of the products was often misleading because it suggested that they offered comprehensive coverage. “In fact,” Mr. Grassley said, “there’s no basic protection against high medical costs. The products may leave consumers seriously in debt if they need intensive medical care.” The criticism is potentially embarrassing to AARP because the organization has long taken pride in its role as a champion of its members and consumers in general. It has criticized “hard-sell tactics” of private insurers and has accused the Bush administration of overstating the value of private health plans offered to Medicare beneficiaries. William D. Novelli, the chief executive of AARP, said he was eager to address Senator Grassley’s concerns. “Ensuring the protection and keeping the trust of our members drives all that we do at AARP,” Mr. Novelli said. Bonnie Burns, an insurance counselor at California Health Advocates, an education and advocacy group, said: “These limited-benefit policies have been a problem for many years. Uninsured people buy them thinking they are equivalent to major medical coverage, but they are not.” For example, one of AARP’s Medical Advantage plans pays a maximum of $5,000 for surgical procedures that may cost two or three times that amount. The marketing materials highlight coverage for relatively low-cost procedures. A consumer guide to AARP’s Medical Advantage plans says they “can be a real lifesaver for early retirees, part-time workers or people who just need to supplement their current health insurance.” Though known in Washington as a potent lobby, AARP is also a huge business that offers travel services, life and homeowner’s insurance, mutual funds and credit cards. Its operating revenue last year was $1.2 billion, more than 40 percent of which came from royalties, according to its 2007 financial statement. Senator Grassley said he wanted AARP to disclose the profits it had made from sales of its limited-benefit insurance products, which are managed by a taxable subsidiary of AARP Inc., the parent organization. At a hearing in June, a Texas woman, Lisa Kelly, told the Senate Finance Committee that she discovered the limits of her AARP policy when she went to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston for treatment of leukemia. The hospital demanded a check for $45,000 up front, Ms. Kelly testified. Martha Jones, a spokeswoman for UnitedHealth, said the company was cooperating with the investigation being performed for AARP. The investigation does not concern the marketing of prescription drug plans or Medicare Advantage plans offered by UnitedHealth and endorsed by AARP.",

On weekends, Dr. West travels the country delivering lectures, being, in his own words, “a bluesman in the life of the mind, a jazzman in the world of ideas, forever on the move.” HEEDING THE CALL I’ve never spent a weekend in Princeton. I would like to be at home, but my calling beckons me. I’ve got places to go, from schools to community centers to prisons to churches to mosques to universities to trade unions. There’s academic lectures, political lectures, religious lectures. It’s just my regular weekly travel. The aim is to touch minds and settle souls; so you instruct as well as delight. EARLY RISER I usually get up in a different part of the country every Sunday, usually very early, about 6:30 a.m. It’s just the habit, you know. I’m traveling, so I’ve got to get moving. I usually hit four cities in a weekend. THE PLACES HE GOES All over. This past weekend, I was in Seattle, Oakland, Sacramento and Chicago. Next weekend, I’m going to Dallas, Houston and back to Chicago. I stay in hotels. They provide for me. None of this is out of my pocket; I’m as broke as I can be. FAITH-BASED Am I religious? Am I a black man born to my parents, Irene and Clifton West? I am, indeed, indeed. I am a profoundly Jesus-loving free black man who bears witness to truth and justice until the day I die. WHICH CHURCHES? Christian and Baptist. Funky Baptist, which means you focus on the blood at the cross where you find the love and freedom to bear witness to truth and justice. And funky as in George Clinton-and-James Brown funky, as opposed to deodorized. FAVORITE HOUSES OF WORSHIP If I can, if possible, I usually go to a black Baptist church. Concord Baptist in Brooklyn. Enon Tabernacle Baptist in Philadelphia. Abyssinian in Harlem, with my dear brother Calvin Butts. I’ve spoken at his church three times. And Mother Zion Church on West 137th Street. I just spoke there. I’m not an ordained or licensed preacher, but they ask me to preach anyway. NO BREAKFAST I haven’t had breakfast on a Sunday since 1984. WHAT HAPPENED IN 1984? We won’t go into that. It was a special Sunday. But I always have water. It’s decaf coffee from Monday to Thursday. HITTING THE BOOKS Downtime is reading; I’m always reading on the plane, whatever the reading is for course work the next week. I’m also always rereading the classics, Plato, St. Augustine. EVER READ FLUFF? I might pick up Time or Newsweek and take a peek. PREPPING FOR CLASS I try to shoot to be home by 8 or 9 at night. I like to get home and wash my clothes. I have to read all night; I have to be real fresh for class. I like to read two or three hours every night. Right now I’m reading Robert Brandom , one of the great pragmatic American philosophers. I read until 2, 2:30 a.m. I don’t really need that much sleep. IN THE COMPANY OF GREATS I’ve been married three times. I’m married to my calling, but I’m not married to a particular woman. I have no pets. My apartment is full of books and records, the light of Toni Morrison and John Coltrane . And Chekhov, everywhere.",

    "source": "The Swaps Market Is Too Big to Ban <eos> Is the market for credit-default swaps in for a renaissance? George Soros, for one, reckons credit derivatives should be banned. But trading in swaps has so far survived the crisis and market reforms are on the way. Barring unexpectedly draconian regulatory changes, a comeback looks likely. In a credit-default swap, the buyer pays the seller a fee to protect against default on a notional amount of a borrower’s debt, typically in increments of $10 million. If the borrower defaults, the seller pays up. Losses on an oversize book of particularly wacky versions of these derivatives forced the American International Group to take a gigantic government bailout. Cheery forecasts for growth in swaps trading from Icap, a British broker, and the Intercontinental Exchange, the clearinghouse, are therefore a bit surprising. After all, the notional volume of outstanding contracts declined by 14 percent, to $36 trillion, in the first half of 2009, according to the Bank for International Settlements. In part, the decline reflects the efforts of dealers to cancel out offsetting contracts. But trading activity has also fallen. There’s still uncertainty over reforms being mulled by lawmakers and regulators in the United States and Europe. Sensibly, they mostly want swaps contracts to be traded through central clearinghouses rather than bilaterally, the traditional way of doing business. Done right, that ought to reduce the systemic risk of an individual market participant going bust. It should also mean collateral requirements are standardized and more uniformly enforced. Both reforms would have eased A.I.G.’s troubles. Central clearing of swaps, and maybe exchange trading of the most popular instruments, would accelerate an existing trend toward electronic trading, especially in the United States, which has lagged in that regard. Standardization could also bring in a wider range of users. Admittedly, some policy makers want to squash the swaps market much more forcefully, and the instruments do have structural imperfections that still need work. But it looks likely that reforms to improve the market’s workings will trump the idea of shutting it down. With that in mind, forecasting a return to robust market growth makes sense. Central clearinghouses and electronic trading led the energy derivatives market to bloom in recent years. The return of credit risk-taking wouldn’t please everyone, but the credit-default swaps market could emerge bigger and stronger, too. The India Option Let’s hope everyone enjoyed President Obama’s first state dinner on Tuesday night in honor of Manmohan Singh, India’s prime minister. China, America’s second-largest trade partner after Canada, usually gets the bigger reception. But United States trade with India, the world’s most populous democracy, is more balanced. The United States-China trading relationship is enormous, but one-sided. Imports are 4.5 times exports to China. That is fueled by the undervalued Chinese currency, but it also to some extent reflects Chinese protectionism that hampers American exports. Trade with India is much smaller, but growing rapidly. It is also closer to equilibrium. Indian exports to the United States are only 25 percent larger than American exports to India, less broken than American trade as a whole. Moreover, India is more open than it used to be to foreign direct investment, typically an American strength. India’s foreign direct investment was nearly a third of what China’s was in 2008, but up from less than 10 percent in 2000-2. Along with the huge and one-sided trade position, China’s holdings of $800 billion in United States Treasuries make America’s economic relationship with the country too unbalanced to be comfortable. With its huge population, nearly as large as China’s, and robust economic growth rate, India offers the United States a healthy alternative partner. India’s finances are not as solid as China’s. Moody’s warned on Tuesday, for example, that Indian banks had an excessively high level of nonperforming loans. The Indian budget deficit is also large. That, however, is a problem shared with the United States. Mr. Singh, a Social Democrat, should also be broadly in tune politically with Mr. Obama. The Obama administration can’t afford to distance itself from China. But economically and politically, India is a more congenial partner. Mr. Obama could avoid developing too much of an overriding bilateral relationship with China by dining more with Mr. Singh. NICHOLAS PAISNER and MARTIN HUTCHINSON",

    "source": "Celgene to Pay $1 Billion for Biotech Collaboration With Juno <eos> Celgene , a leading biotech company, said on Monday that it would pay about $1 billion to start a collaboration with Juno Therapeutics , a leader in the hot new area of cancer drugs that harness patients’ immune systems to attack tumors. Most of the $1 billion Celgene will pay will go toward acquiring about 9.1 million shares of Juno at $93 a share. That is about double the price at which Juno closed on Monday, before rising about 40 percent after hours. Juno, which is based in Seattle, went public in December in one of the largest initial offerings ever in the biotechnology industry. That reflected the excitement around its technology, which involves genetically engineering patients’ immune system cells so they can recognize and attack tumors. A deal with Celgene, which is one of the largest biotechnology companies, could help Juno better compete with Novartis , the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, which is developing similar treatments, which are called chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR-T. Many other companies are also in the race. No such drug is approved for sale yet, but in small clinical trials, the approach has led to some substantial remissions among patients with various blood cancers. “Celgene is the ideal partner for Juno to help us realize the full potential of our science and clinical research while maintaining the independence we, our employees, partners and investors believe is so critical for true innovation,” Hans Bishop, the chief executive of Juno, said in a statement. Celgene is a leader in drugs to treat the cancer multiple myeloma , based mainly on its blockbuster Revlimid. It is also known for entering into what some analysts see as generous deals with smaller companies for new drugs and technology, giving it access to a wide variety of potential approaches to treating cancer. But some analysts said that Celgene overpaid. CAR-T and related approaches are not yet totally validated, nor is it clear so far how applicable the techniques will be in treating so-called solid tumors like breast, lung and prostate cancers, which represent a far larger potential market than the blood cancers. “Celgene’s management are to be congratulated on the audacity of their deal-making, but we expect investors to bridle at the company’s increasingly aggressive front-end loading of their transactions,” Geoffrey Porges, a biotechnology analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said in a note on Monday. “This transaction amounts to prepaying much of the cost of a distance asset well in advance of the delivery of the asset,” a risky move given the frequent failures in drug development, he said. Celgene executives said the collaboration would help change the face of cancer care. “We consider the combined efforts will far exceed the sum of the parts,” said Dr. Thomas O. Daniel, who leads research and early development for the company. Celgene shares fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading. Celgene will pay $150 million to Juno, and also purchase 9,137,672 newly issued shares at $93 each, giving it about a 10 percent stake in Juno. By the end of the 10-year collaboration, Celgene will be able to increase its stake to as much as 30 percent under certain conditions. It will get one seat on Juno’s board. Under the terms of the agreement, Celgene has the option to be the commercialization partner for Juno’s cancer drugs and also any cell therapies it develops for autoimmune diseases. That includes the cancer drugs Juno now has in clinical trials. Juno will remain responsible for research, development and commercialization in North America. Celgene will be responsible for development and commercialization in the rest of the world and will pay Juno a royalty on sales. The companies may also collaborate globally on certain experimental Juno programs, not including its most advanced ones. And Juno has the option to codevelop and help commercialize certain Celgene drug candidates that are aimed at T cells. Some analysts have said that investors have become overly enthusiastic about engineered T cells, given that the therapies can have severe side effects. Juno has technology from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, the Seattle Children’s Research Institute and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and they could be in for a windfall if the company succeeds.",

    "source": "This Web TV Is for You, Especially if You’re a Male Aged 21 to 34 <eos> IF Anheuser-Busch has its way, it may not be long before consumers start insisting “I want my BTV.” That’s “BTV” as in Bud TV, an online entertainment network that Anheuser-Busch, the nation’s biggest brewer, is preparing to introduce the day after Super Bowl XLI is played in early February. The network, which will be on a Web site that will have the bud.tv address, accelerates a push by Anheuser-Busch into the business of providing program content. Advertisers becoming content providers, a practice known as branded entertainment, is helping reshape how Madison Avenue peddles wares. It reflects an effort by marketers to regain some of the power they wielded from the 1930’s through the 1950’s, when they owned the radio and television shows they sponsored. Anheuser-Busch is joining a lengthy list of marketers turning to branded entertainment. Others include American Honda Motor, Best Buy, Cadbury Schweppes, General Motors, Krups, Nestlé, Pepsi-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Stolichnaya and Washington Mutual. Critics complain that branded entertainment is hastening the commercialization of American popular culture. “It’s the advertisers swallowing the programming,” said Gary Ruskin, executive director at Commercial Alert in Portland, Ore., a nonprofit organization that fights what it considers to be creeping commercialism. “We live in a time of great overreaching by the advertising and marketing industry,” Mr. Ruskin said. “This is one further step toward advertiser control of media.” Marketers are embracing branded entertainment because it can serve as a counterweight to the growing ability of TV viewers to use devices like digital video recorders and remote controls to skip, flip past and otherwise avoid conventional interruptive 30-second commercials. “We still have plenty of strong, traditional national TV venues for our messages such as live sports,” said Anthony T. Ponturo, vice president for global media and sports marketing at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, part of the Anheuser-Busch Companies. Going forward, “the Internet will be equal to or better than television,” Mr. Ponturo said, particularly in reaching the company’s target audience for beers like Budweiser and Bud Light, which is men ages 21 to 34. “We’re trying to get out in front of consumers who are spending six hours a week online,” he added. “Marketers had better understand how to effectively reach them.” Mr. Ponturo and James M. Schumacker, the new leader of the Anheuser-Busch digital marketing team, discussed the company’s plans yesterday with reporters. Anheuser-Busch is scheduled to announce today the intended start of Bud TV on Feb. 5. Although it is too soon to discuss the specifics of spending on Bud TV and its complementary program offerings on cellphones, Mr. Ponturo said, Anheuser-Busch is expected to double the share of its marketing budget devoted to online advertising, to 10 percent. That would include spending on Web sites that the company already operates, he added, like budweiser.com and budlight.com , as well as spending for ads on more than 40 third-party Web sites like espn.com and yahoo.com . According to TNS Media Intelligence, Anheuser-Busch spent $919.4 million last year to advertise in all major media, ranking the company 40th among the largest American advertisers. The plans call for Bud TV to offer computer users six channels of comedy, reality, sports and talk programming created for and by Anheuser-Busch. The tentative names for the channels include Comedy, Happy Hour and Reality. Sources for the programs will include agencies that create advertising for Anheuser-Busch like @radical.media and DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group; companies owned by Hollywood stars like LivePlanet (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon), TriggerStreet.com (Kevin Spacey), and Wild West Picture Show Productions (Vince Vaughn); and production companies like Omelet and Seed. Anheuser-Busch is in discussions with Joe Buck, the sportscaster, to develop a talk show, Mr. Schumacker said, and “we may add a fashion channel” at some point. A seventh channel on Bud TV, tentatively named Bud Tube, will be styled after the popular Web site YouTube ( youtube.com ), Mr. Schumacker said, giving consumers a chance to “generate their own Anheuser-Busch ads, comedic in nature,” which can be shared with other computer users. The idea for Bud Tube, Mr. Schumacker said, came from another agency that works for Anheuser-Busch, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, also part of Omnicom. The first assignment consumers can tackle, he added, is to make their own versions of a series of Bud Light commercials featuring a character called Ted Ferguson, billed as the “Bud Light daredevil.” Anheuser-Busch will borrow another page from the YouTube playbook, Mr. Ponturo said, by setting up the programming on Bud TV so that computer users can repurpose it on other Web sites like YouTube and MySpace ( myspace.com ). “We see this as a marketing tool to talk to consumers,” Mr. Ponturo said, “rather than as a production company or a network whose goal is to make money on programming.” His reference was to efforts by some networks and producers to have content they created removed from sharing sites like MySpace and YouTube. There has been speculation that Anheuser-Busch wanted to expand its presence in the content arena beyond a unit, Bud Productions, that creates sports programs. That speculation reached a fever pitch before the Super Bowl in February, when trade publications reported that the company would offer computer users a desktop application so they could take another look at the Budweiser and Bud Light commercials that ran during the game. Instead, Anheuser-Busch chose to offer downloads of the commercials on budweiser.com and budlight.com. After 700,000 downloads, Mr. Ponturo said, “we learned a little bit” about the preferences of computer users, adding that the commercials were watched by an additional 22 million visitors to other Web sites like video.google.com and video.yahoo.com . The trade publication Advertising Age reported in its Aug. 21 issue that Anheuser-Busch would make entertainment programs available online. Mr. Schumacker said that Bud TV would also offer a desktop application that can be downloaded to deliver a program from the Happy Hour channel each day at 4:55 p.m.. Anheuser-Busch intends to monitor the use of Bud TV so that it is not watched by minors under 21, Mr. Schumacker and Mr. Ponturo said, adding that when computer users sign up and create profiles, they will be asked to provide identifying information beyond age and birth date. To critics like Mr. Ruskin of Commercial Alert, there is one small silver lining in something like Bud TV. “As advertising becomes more and more aggressive and intrusive, people will dislike it more than they do,” Mr. Ruskin said, “and we’ll do better at efforts to keep advertising in its proper place.”",

    "source": "Hockey’s Islanders Feeling Cast Away <eos> Uniondale, N.Y. In the first warm weather of spring, it’s time to think about heading toward Jones Beach . But first, like a regular Indiana Jones, I make a detour past the empty tomb of the ancient empire — Raiders of the Lost Cup. Flashback: Arriving for a Stanley Cup finals game with the May sun in my eyes, circa 1980-84. Mike Bossy stealing a pass from Harold Snepsts and killing the Canucks in overtime. Anders Kallur, wearing only an athletic supporter, displaying the Cup to his relatives from Sweden . Laughter and pride and success. No doubt, fans in other places have their memories. Chicago fans remember Jordan and Pippen. San Francisco fans remember Montana and Rice. Pittsburgh fans remember that slim young Bonds chap. On Long Island, we remember Butch Goring’s funky old helmet .  It is hard to watch the late stages of the N.H.L. playoffs these May nights because the Red Wings are the Islanders of this generation, and the Penguins remind me of the young Islanders of the late ’70s, with their best years ahead of them, maybe. It is hard to drive past the mundane Nassau Coliseum , plopped down in a parking lot, sensing that it really may be time for the Islanders to vanish. “Wherever the people are as green as the money, friend,” Professor Harold Hill in “The Music Man” said when asked where he was heading. It is never a good sign when the owner of a sports franchise expresses buyer’s remorse, but that is what Charles Wang is doing these days. “ If I had the chance, I wouldn’t do it again ,” Wang recently said on WFAN about his ownership of the Islanders — claiming a $300 million loss, and counting. The franchise of Smitty and Nystrom is in grave jeopardy because of the world economy, of course, but the Islanders seem to be an especially risky business. Wang, one of the founders of Computer Associates , now a developer, has painted the Islanders into a corner. The team stinks — worst record in the league this season — and the Coliseum is a dump. Any self-respecting member of the Sports Franchise Owners Union knows enough to hustle the locals for a snazzy new palace, or at least some sweet little extras. The Yankees got Mayor Bloomberg to plow down children’s parkland . The Mets got some “infrastructure” out of the Big Apple for their new playpen in Queens. But Wang has a better idea. He does not merely want a new arena on Nassau County land. He has blatantly tied any new arena into an agreement for him to build something called the Lighthouse — theoretically, $3.7 billion worth of housing and stores and hotels, in a county that historically does not do planning. This unlikely Shangri-La is caught up in the normal double-dip politics of Nassau County. The Republican supervisor of the town of Hempstead, Kate Murray, did not show up for a planned meeting with Wang and Democratic county leaders recently, but she had time to hire her 83-year-old father for a $40-an-hour part-time job in the town attorney’s office. With priorities like that, it is hard to imagine keeping the Islanders. Wang sounds beaten down — or devious — about the yawning lack of corporate support for a hockey team on Long Island. Fact is, the Islanders have never been a cushy operation. They won four Stanley Cups in a row because brilliant hockey minds scouted players from Sweden to Alberta, and Al Arbour goaded them to their potential. For the Stanley Cup finals, management disinfected unused party rooms at the Coliseum and hung out tattered bunting. And it was glorious, because of the product on the ice. Talk about flashbacks. The Islanders have scheduled an exhibition in Kansas City, Mo., on Sept. 22. That rings my bell with memories of the Brooklyn Dodgers playing seven regular-season games in Jersey City in 1956 and 1957 . Walter O’Malley was warning us he was moving west — and he did. The Islanders have a lease in Nassau through 2015, but you never know.  The N.H.L. is having other major tremors in its tectonic plates. The Sun Belt strategy did not really work for American television networks. The Phoenix franchise is bankrupt, and a man wants to move it to Hamilton, Ontario, halfway between Toronto and Buffalo — hockey country. My belief is that the N.H.L. needs Canadian enthusiasm and expertise more than it has acknowledged. It needs franchises where kids skate on ponds, where fans gossip about junior hockey, where people can take mass transit to urban arenas to watch a beloved sport: Hamilton. Quebec City. Winnipeg. Saskatoon. The true north strong and free. It just may be that hockey has come and gone on Long Island. The Devils have inspired leadership and play in downtown Newark — an easy train ride from most of Long Island. The Rangers, despite being run by the Dolans , are a money machine in the center of the universe. The Islanders? Well, we have our memories. Bob Bourne’s 1983 hipper-dipper move right through the Ranger defense . It is late spring again on Long Island. Time to think about the beach.",

    "source": "Consortium Rescues Bell Canada Takeover <eos> OTTAWA — A private equity and pension fund consortium said it salvaged a record $52 billion deal for Bell Canada on Friday by postponing its closing date until mid-December and renegotiating some terms of the transaction — including canceling dividend payments on the telecommunication giant’s common stock. A group of four banks, including Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, which originally agreed to provide about $34 billion in financing for the blockbuster purchase when it was first announced last year, had been demanding changes in the original terms because of the many challenges brought on by the continuing credit squeeze. The deal, the largest leveraged buyout to date, was originally scheduled to close on Monday but had gotten mired in response to bankers’ concerns and legal issues. The new closing date is Dec. 11. Because the deal is structured under a unique Canadian court procedure, repricing it to address the lenders’ concerns would have been difficult and time-consuming. But the new agreement gets around that problem — and effectively reduces the purchase price by about $1.5 billion, just under $2 a share — by postponing the closing date and halting the dividend payments. Shareholders, however, will still receive the original price of 42.75 Canadian dollars ($41.96) — for their shares, an amount that is high by current market standards. The bank group, which is lending about 85 percent of the purchase price, also extracted slightly higher interest rates from the purchasers and some changes to the lending agreements, said a person with direct knowledge of the negotiations who declined to be named because he was not an official spokesman for the group. A Bell spokesman, William J. Fox, declined to estimate how much extra cash would flow into the company’s coffers from the canceled dividend payments and general revenue. On Monday, Bell, which is based in Montreal and is Canada’s largest telecommunications company, announced that it was deferring its second-quarter common share dividend payments and estimated doing so would save it about 294 million Canadian dollars ($288 million). Although the credit crisis has not abated and banks have come under greater financial pressures as the American economy sags, participants in the Bell transaction said they were optimistic that there would be no further delays and that the deal would close in December. Another roadblock had been a legal challenge from bondholders who argued that the deal unfairly depressed the value of the company’s current debt. While a Quebec appeals court upheld that complaint and effectively struck down the deal, its ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada last month. “The signing of the financing and credit agreements and the resolution of issues involved in funding this transaction are the essential milestones to closing with both the purchaser and the lenders,” said Michael J. Sabia, the chief executive of Bell, in a statement. Deborah Allan, a spokeswoman for the lead purchaser, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, said that “everyone will see this as being positive.” The other main buyers include Providence Equity Partners, Madison Dearborn Partners and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity. Mr. Sabia, who was scheduled to leave the company when the transaction closed, will now step down on July 11. He will be replaced by George Cope, who heads the Bell telephone operations in Ontario and Quebec. Under terms announced Monday, the buyers agreed to increase the fee they would pay if the takeover was not completed to 1.2 billion Canadian dollars ($1.18 billion), from 1 billion Canadian dollars. “It speaks to the commitment of the purchase group,” Mr. Fox said.",

    "source": "Howard Carries the Phillies on His Broad Shoulders <eos> PHILADELPHIA — Each time up, Ryan Howard scratches the chalk line at the rear of the batter’s box, bends low, taps the plate twice and holds his bat in one hand as if it were a torch to be set aflame. What happens next is not so easily or consistently replicated. When Howard rushes, his weight begins to drift forward too quickly, his right shoulder leaning the way one nudges a friend who has told a ribald joke. The shoulder swings wide and Howard tends to hook the ball toward the right side. He hit .206 through May for the Phillies , trying in frustration to muscle the ball with his hands and arms, attempting to smash what Manager Charlie Manuel calls the 11-run homer. When Howard remains patient, waiting, waiting, until that moment when the ball comes so close that it seems to leave him defensive and flat-footed, a subtle but profound shift occurs. The hips pivot, the hands snap forward in a blur ahead of his shoulder, and a great kinetic unleashing comes from his rear leg. He does not stride so much as he swings the way a boxer throws a punch, feet set, his power deriving not simply from muscle but from balance, timing and rhythm. At these moments, when he sees the ball clearly, meaning when he picks up the spin and location, Howard can wait a little late and still drive the ball over the fence to the opposite field. In recounting these at-bats, Manuel marvels at the strength in Howard’s 6-foot-4, 250-pound frame, holding his hands apart to approximate Howard’s biceps, holding them so wide that he appears to be gripping an imaginary pumpkin. As the Phillies chase a second consecutive title in the National League East, Howard, 28, has become a contender to win his second Most Valuable Player award in three seasons. After Wednesday’s 10-4 loss to Atlanta, he leads the majors with 47 home runs and 142 runs batted in. Twenty-two of his home runs have gone to the opposite, or left, field — the most in the majors. Thirty-four of his R.B.I. have put the Phillies ahead in a game, tops in the league. “You couple a guy who can go the other way with a guy who’s now patient, and that’s a dangerous combination,” Will Ohman, the Atlanta left-hander, said of Howard. “He gets his front foot down early in order to read the ball, so he can see spin and location. That puts him at a great advantage. It puts the pitcher at a disadvantage, because you lose deception. No matter what I throw him, it ends up 340 feet to the opposite field.” As his hitting has heated up, though, Howard’s willingness to discuss his stroke has grown cold. Speaking of the successes of September means recalling the failures of April and May. Howard is not willing to go there. Politely but firmly. Perhaps he is afraid of jinxing himself with paralysis by analysis. “I just don’t feel like talking about it,” Howard said. “It’s not really all that big a deal.” If Howard does win a second M.V.P. award, the thinking among voters will go something like this: Albert Pujols had a great season in St. Louis, but the Cardinals faded. No one has been more valuable to a team than Manny Ramírez has been to the Dodgers, but he has been in Los Angeles only a third of a season after being traded from Boston. Carlos Delgado has had a great second half for the Mets, but Howard would trump him with a division title. “I like Delgado,” Manuel said. “He’s had a big second half. Howard got off slow. He’s gotten better and better as the season has gone on. If you want to go look and see what his batting average is from the seventh inning on, or go look and see how many big runs he knocks in and how many game-winning hits he’s got for us and how many big home runs he’s hit from the seventh inning on, he’s ahead of those guys in terms of production. “What’s the game all about? It’s about production.” Of course, there are valid reasons to vote for someone other than Howard. Pujols, for instance, is hitting more than 100 points higher than Howard’s average of .248, and he has struck out nearly 150 fewer times than Howard’s total of 195. In the modern era, no M.V.P. winner in the National League has hit lower than the .267 that Marty Marion batted for St. Louis in 1944. Some believe that Howard is not even the most valuable Phillie, with closer Brad Lidge having saved 40 games in his first 40 opportunities. “If you ask people in this town, most will tell you Lidge has been the most valuable player on this team,” said Glen Macnow, a talk-show radio host on WIP-AM. “But as they vote for M.V.P. in the league, Howard’s the stronger candidate. But you can look it up. If you stopped games after seven innings, the Mets would be something like 10 ½ games ahead of the Phillies right now. That’s about two things — the Mets’ terrible bullpen and the Phillies’ entire bullpen, especially Lidge.” Howard’s numbers seem to tumble out with the randomness of a lottery drawing. With no one on base, he is hitting .195. With runners in scoring position, it is .312. The first month of the season, he hit .172. In September, he is hitting .342. Why the traditional slow start? The theories are as voluminous as they are unproven: not enough plate appearances at spring training; too much cold weather at the start of the season; early frustration at trying to hit through the infield shift that opposing teams regularly apply, placing the shortstop behind second base and the second baseman in short right field. “He’s still trying to find out exactly where he’s at,” Manuel said. “Is he a .280 hitter, or is he a .300 hitter? Or is he a .240 hitter or a .220 hitter? I think he’s somewhere in between .280 and .300. When he does that, his strikeouts should be lower and his production will be higher.” Manuel added: “If I could tell you one thing about his swing, it’s patience. You know what Ted Williams said, ‘Get a good ball to hit.’ Ryan doesn’t get a good ball to hit at times.” That patience was evident Tuesday night in a 3-2 defeat to Atlanta. Howard punched a single to center field, tripled to the right-field corner, walked twice and scored both of Philadelphia’s runs. Late in games with men on base, late in the season, Howard seems more focused and resolute, Manuel said. “He’s so strong and quick; when he’s able to trust that — trust his eyes, his hands, trust that he is quick enough and doesn’t have to be any quicker to the ball, that’s when the real Ryan comes out,” said his teammate Greg Dobbs, who leads the majors with 22 pinch-hits. “Now, he’s trusting himself.” Lidge said he had never seen another hitter with such voluminous production in September. “In April, I remember listening to him, and he said he wasn’t seeing the ball,” Lidge said. “As he started seeing it, there’s really not a lot of pitches that can be thrown that he can’t drive out of the park. It doesn’t matter who’s throwing them, either. The tear he’s been on, basically you can’t throw him a fastball over the plate or it’s gone.”",

    "source": "BAE Systems Faces Corruption Charges in Britain <eos> LONDON — Britain ’s Serious Fraud Office said Thursday that it would file charges against BAE Systems, one of the world’s largest weapons makers, after failing to reach a settlement over bribery accusations in relation to arms deals in Africa and Eastern Europe. In a sudden turn of events in an investigation that has stretched over more than five years and tarnished the reputations of both BAE Systems and the fraud office, prosecutors said they would prepare documents to ask the attorney general for permission to take BAE Systems to court. BAE Systems has denied any involvement in bribery and said Thursday that it “acted responsibly in its dealings with the Serious Fraud Office” and was ready to face prosecutors in court if necessary. The charges relate to arms deals in South Africa, the Czech Republic, Romania and Tanzania, most of them in the 1990s. BAE Systems came under pressure to settle the case, but some investors said Thursday that without any certainty that it would face court proceedings, there was little upside for the company to agree to a settlement. A settlement and any admission of guilt could also jeopardize the ability of BAE Systems to win contracts in the future. BAE’s shares dropped 4.2 percent Thursday in London amid concern that a settlement in the case could cost the company more than the $1.6 billion that the German engineering giant Siemens agreed to pay last year to settle bribery charges. The fraud office decided to seek charges because “the investigation that commenced in July 2004 now reached a stage where it has to be taken further,” said David Jones, a spokesman for the fraud office. He did not give details on when prosecutors planned to ask for court proceedings. Christopher Grierson, a partner in the bribery and corruption task force at Lovells, a London law firm, said it could be weeks or months before the attorney general reaches a decision.",

    "source": "Chinese Soldiers Rush to Bolster Weakened Dams <eos> CHENGDU, China — China mobilized 30,000 additional soldiers to the earthquake -shattered expanses of the nation’s southwestern regions on Wednesday — not just to help victims, but also to shore up weakened dams and other elements of the infrastructure whose failure could compound the disaster. Experts said that these dams were built around the well-recognized Longmen Shan fault. They warned that such dams might have sustained damage that could cause them to fail even weeks later. Much depends on efforts to reduce the menacing pressure of water behind the dam walls. Two thousand soldiers were sent to a dam just three miles upriver from the devastated town of Dujiangyan, northwest of the provincial capital of Chengdu, to inspect a structure that has shown some cracks and is “in great danger,” according to state-controlled China National Radio. Dams and their electric generators are only the most visible aspects of the infrastructure battered by the earthquake: The region also is the site of the cities of Guangyuan and Mianyang, which are home to plants that build Chinese nuclear arms and process plutonium for the weapons. It is not clear whether the plants suffered damage. On Wednesday afternoon Chinese officials raised their estimate of the number of people killed to nearly 15,000. The latest figures put the number of people still buried at 26,000 and the missing at 14,000. The deployment of a total of 100,000 members of security forces across the disaster zone, most from the People’s Liberation Army, is one of the largest peacetime mobilizations by any country in recent memory. The soldiers marched through mud and debris to reach mountain towns at the epicenter on Wednesday while army helicopters began dropping food and medicine. On Thursday morning, high up in Beichuan, where the county seat had been flattened, workers brought rescue dogs to the ruins of a school where 1,000 children were believed buried. Bodies lay strewn throughout the town. Hundreds of thousands of people remain homeless everywhere, and all across the region people are seeking shelter wherever they can find it, sleeping beneath plastic tarps, living in stadiums and lying on sidewalks. The damage to dams and reservoirs is extensive. The People’s Daily, a state-run newspaper, reported that 51 reservoirs were “in danger” around the municipality of Chongqing, 170 miles east of Chengdu and closer to the gargantuan Three Gorges Dam. Hundreds of irrigation and water supply systems around Chongqing were damaged, amounting to an economic loss of $72 million. There have been warnings that a serious breach of the Zipingpu Reservoir, which the soldiers were to inspect, could flood Dujiangyan, where hundreds of schoolchildren have been buried in rubble and where blocks of buildings have crashed to the ground. The irrigation system there dates to the third century B.C., and Dujiangyan is close to the epicenter of the 7.9-magnitude quake that struck on Monday. According to the official Xinhua News Agency, the earthquake “caused cracks on the surface of the dam of the Zipingpu Hydropower Station. Some walls of the plant and other buildings have collapsed, and some are partly sunk.” Experts from China’s earthquake bureau raised concerns about the station’s location near a fault zone before it was built in 2000, according to Aviva Imhof, the China program director for the International Rivers Network, a group that opposed construction of the dam. She cited leaked transcripts of a September 2000 meeting about the issue. The National Development and Reform Commission released a report on Wednesday saying that 391 reservoirs in five provinces had been damaged. The nature of the damage is unclear, and so is the effect it might have on the lives of people in this mostly rural, mostly poor swath of China. Two reservoirs in the report are considered large, and 28 are midsize. On Monday, Xinhua cited an executive with the China Three Gorges Project Corporation saying that the Three Gorges Dam, 350 miles east of the quake’s epicenter, had no damage. J. David Rogers, a professor in the department of geological engineering at the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla, said the Zipingpu station was a concrete-faced rockfill dam 512 feet high. That means it is not made fully of concrete. Rather, it has a surface of concrete that covers an interior structure of rock and earth. Such a structure could be expected to have a “very noticeable” amount of settlement and cracking in a quake like this one, Dr. Rogers said. No matter what the damage is, he said, the first thing to do is to lower the level of water behind the wall, reducing the overall pressure that can cause further damage. A dam can fail in slow motion, he said. “If they do have a leak, this thing could fail two weeks from now.” One state news media report said late Wednesday that inspectors had declared the Zipingpu dam safe, while China National Radio said that soldiers would, in fact, release some water. A reporter for Caijing, a respected Chinese news magazine, wrote online Wednesday that he had seen cracks on the dam 10 centimeters wide and that workers had already drained the water to such a degree that parts of the reservoir bottom were visible. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao was shown on state television Wednesday telling survivors that 100,000 soldiers, paramilitary troops and police officers would be involved in relief efforts. For comparison, in 2005 the American federal and state governments dispatched about 50,000 members of the National Guard in eight days to areas ravaged by Hurricane Katrina . The soldiers arriving at Wenchuan County, at the quake’s epicenter, began ferrying survivors across rivers on plastic skiffs. But in Yingxiu, the first township that the soldiers reached, only 2,300 of 10,000 residents could be confirmed alive, according to Xinhua. A poor farming region that is home to a famous panda reserve, Wenchuan is one of the worst-hit areas. “There is an urgent need for medical staff, medicine, food and drinking water,” He Biao, the deputy secretary general of the prefectural government that includes Wenchuan, told Xinhua. The fact that aid was able to reach Wenchuan was a minor triumph in the aftermath of the worst natural disaster to hit China in more than 30 years. Until Wednesday, Wenchuan had been completely cut off. Half of the survivors had severe injuries, Chinese officials said. The threat of earthquakes and aftershocks remained high across the region. Tremors could be felt in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, on Wednesday and Thursday mornings. The rains that had hampered aid efforts for two days let up on Wednesday, allowing easier travel and granting reprieve to cold survivors. The weather had forced the military to cancel rescue plans that included parachuting soldiers into Wenchuan and other hard-hit areas. “Sichuan is so tremendously mountainous, it’s difficult to reach some of these areas even without an earthquake,” said Kate Janis, a program director at Mercy Corps, an aid organization that is preparing to send food, medicine and other supplies. More than 800 police officers arrived in Yingxiu soon after 200 soldiers got through. Photos taken from a helicopter flying over a town in Wenchuan County showed empty avenues and rows of deserted buildings, and what appeared to be a cluster of makeshift tents on a soccer field. Rocks and mudslides have cut off roads to the county, only a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Chengdu, and phone service has been wholly disrupted. At 4 p.m. Wednesday, in nearby Hanwang Township, some 200 young soldiers marched toward a mountain range on the eastern flank of Wenchuan. As they reached the end of an undamaged road, they descended in two rows to a riverbed, then forded the muddy river. Their destination was Qingping, a village of 5,000 deep in the mountains. It was still a 10-hour walk away. Li Zhengxin, 17, a boy whose nearby hometown had been destroyed, watched the soldiers disappear around a bend in the deep ravine. “They are like our bodhisattvas,” he said, using the word for an enlightened Buddhist who helps others attain nirvana. “Now that they are here, our hearts feel more at ease.” A photographer in Hanwang estimated that 70 to 80 percent of the structures had suffered damage, and about a tenth had been flattened. In the evening, cooking fires cast an eerie glow up and down the sidewalks. In Mianyang, where nearly 19,000 people are missing, there were reports of people waiting in line for three hours for a bowl of rice porridge. The number of confirmed dead — 14,866 on Wednesday — is expected to increase by thousands or even tens of thousands as rescue workers reach more remote areas, but some rare moments of good news emerged on Wednesday. A woman who was eight months pregnant and trapped in rubble for 50 hours was pulled to safety in Dujiangyan, The Associated Press reported. Safety officials were able to speak to the pregnant woman, Zhang Xiaoyan, while she was trapped, but rescue workers proceeded slowly for fear that the rubble above her would collapse. “It is very moving,” said Sun Guoli, the fire chief of Chengdu. “It’s a miracle brought about by us all working together.”",

    "source": "France Suggests Deal Is Near on Tapping Oil Reserve <eos> PARIS — François Fillon , the French prime minister, suggested Thursday that a deal was near among developed countries, including the United States, to tap strategic petroleum reserves to reduce gasoline prices. There are “good prospects” for a deal, Mr. Fillon told France Inter radio, adding his voice to those of other French officials who have said in recent days that the idea, which they attributed to the Obama administration, was under discussion among countries including the United States, Britain and Japan. “If we reach an accord with the other developed countries, we’ll draw on our stocks, push down the price for a limited time,” Mr. Fillon said. “It’s a way to face a crisis that is largely due to the situation today in Iran. But we shouldn’t expect any miracles. It could allow us to stabilize the price, reorient it a little lower.” The price of U.S. crude oil futures for May delivery fell nearly 2 percent Thursday. Domestic political concerns on both sides of the Atlantic may be a factor in the current discussions. President Barack Obama faces a re-election in November, with gasoline prices at $4 a gallon or more in some states. His French counterpart, President Nicolas Sarkozy , may be feeling even greater pressure to act, with gasoline prices in the Paris area at more than €2 a liter, or $10 a gallon, and a first-round election test less than one month away. Nations build oil stockpiles, like the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the United States , to insure against major shocks to supply, like those caused by wars or natural disasters. Last June, the United States and its allies agreed to release 60 million barrels of emergency oil reserves to replace lost Libyan production, helping to soften a spike in prices. Oil prices have risen for a number of reasons, including sanctions against Iran in the standoff over its nuclear ambitions, reduced exports from Syria, Yemen and South Sudan, and demand from India and China. Central banks’ quantitative easing policies, which leave more dollars, yen and euros chasing a finite quantity of the commodity, may also be contributing to the rise in prices. Ali al-Naimi, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, the largest oil producer in the world, said Wednesday in an opinion piece in The Financial Times that the kingdom would also do its utmost to hold prices down so as not to derail the global economic recovery. “The use of strategic stocks is supposed to be the last bullet,” Olivier Jakob, an oil analyst at Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland, wrote in a report Thursday. “If Western powers are seriously envisaging this, then it only shows the lack of commitment they have received from Saudi Arabia to replace the Iranian oil that is falling under the embargo.” “Looking at the way Europe has managed the Greek crisis,” he added, “we should now expect a sound bite about stock releases every day.” Mr. Fillon’s remarks followed similar comments from other French officials. Valérie Pécresse, the budget minister, sought Wednesday to temper expectations of immediate action, saying the government was waiting to see fresh data on the oil market from the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based body that analyzes oil market conditions. The I.E.A.’s executive director, Maria van der Hoeven, said last week that any move to tap reserves — something normally coordinated by the I.E.A. — would be up the countries involved. But in an apparent softening of the I.E.A.’s position, she said in a statement Thursday that the agency was concerned by the impact of high oil prices while the global economic recovery remained fragile. “The I.E.A. is closely monitoring market developments and will remain in close contact with member countries to exchange views about the oil market situation,” she said. “As we have mentioned many times, the I.E.A. was created to respond to serious physical supply disruptions, and we remain ready to act if market conditions so warrant.” An Obama administration official said Wednesday that no decision had been made about how to proceed. “While this is an option that remains on the table, no decisions have been made and no specific actions have been proposed,” Josh Earnest, the deputy White House press secretary, said at a briefing in Washington, Bloomberg News reported.",

    "source": "Hillary Clinton’s Ambitious Climate Change Plan Avoids Carbon Tax <eos> WASHINGTON — Hillary Clinton, courting young voters and the broader Democratic base, has promised to one-up President Obama on climate change, vowing to produce a third of the nation’s electricity from renewable sources by 2027, three years faster than Mr. Obama, while spending billions of dollars to transform the energy economy. A half-billion solar panels will be installed by 2020, she has promised, seven times the number today, and $60 billion will go to states and cities to develop more climate-friendly infrastructure, such as public transportation and energy-efficient buildings. She would put the United States on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050. And, she says, she could achieve all that without new legislation from Congress. But Mrs. Clinton has avoided mention of the one policy that economists widely see as the most effective way to tackle climate change — and one that would need Congress’s assent: putting a price or tax on carbon dioxide emissions. “It’s possible, theoretically, to do all this without a price on carbon,” said David Victor, the director of the Laboratory on International Law and Regulation at the University of California, San Diego. But, he added, “it’s hard to see how.” “The problem is,” he said, “she knows the politics of this are toxic.” John Podesta, a former senior counselor to Mr. Obama who is now the chairman of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, is an architect of both the Obama and Clinton climate change plans. In crafting them, Mr. Podesta, an ardent environmentalist and a seasoned political operative, sought to take substantive action to reduce emissions without turning to Congress, where climate legislation would most likely again be doomed. “Secretary Clinton believes that meeting the climate challenge is too important to wait for climate deniers in Congress to pass comprehensive climate legislation,” Mr. Podesta wrote in an emailed statement. While Mr. Podesta’s climate plan for Mr. Obama centered on using the Clean Air Act to write new regulations to limit emissions from vehicles and power plants, a Clinton administration could return to the same law to issue rules on emissions from other slices of the economy, including the airline industry, oil refineries, gas production wells and cement manufacturers. Image In the short run, a carbon price could drive up the cost of filling gas tanks and lighting homes. Credit Andrea Morales for The New York Times In that way, Mrs. Clinton could walk a difficult line. Her ambitious climate change goals should appeal to young and progressive voters, particularly supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has called for a carbon tax. But by avoiding mention of such a tax, she hopes to avoid Republican attacks on a proposal that would raise gasoline and electricity bills. “In an ideal world, the negative externalities would have a price on them,” said Scott Hennessey, the vice president of policy at the solar power company SolarCity, using an economics term for pollution. “But we know it’s not politically realistic. And we need to be realistic about what we can get.” Economists have noted that by driving up the cost of fossil fuels, a carbon price is intended to push the market toward cleaner sources of energy, such as wind and solar. In the long run, that could make those energy sources cheap and widespread. But in the short run, it could drive up the cost of filling tanks with gasoline and electricity generated by coal and gas — a nonstarter for many voters. Veterans of the Obama administration are still smarting from the president’s failed first-term effort to cap carbon emissions and to force carbon-emitting companies to purchase or trade for permits for every ton of carbon dioxide released. That “cap-and-trade” plan died in Congress in 2010, and contributed to Democrats’ loss of the House majority that year. “A lot of the people who cast those votes in the House ended up paying a big price in the 2010 election,” said David Axelrod, the former senior political adviser on Mr. Obama’s campaigns and in the White House. “If I’m in her campaign, I don’t want to hand a cudgel to the other side.” Conservative campaign operatives agree that they would immediately pounce on any mention by Mrs. Clinton of a carbon price. “Hillary Clinton surely knows the political peril of directly telling American families that she wants to tax their gasoline,” said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by the billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch. Since the political fallout from 2010, Mr. Obama has sought to circumvent Congress on climate change. He used his executive authority to release Clean Air Act regulations on vehicles and power plants, the nation’s two largest sources of carbon pollution. Under the Paris Agreement, an accord committing nearly 200 countries to lowering carbon emissions, Mr. Obama pledged to reduce the United States’ emissions 25 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, and 80 percent by 2050. Image A Wyoming coal mine. Mrs. Clinton would spend $30 billion to help redevelop coal mining communities that are suffering economically in the wake of climate change policies. Credit Kristina Barker for The New York Times Experts say that under a combination of Mr. Obama’s policies and a handful of new policies that would not require Congressional action, it would be possible to reach the 2025 Paris target, but not the 2050 target. Mrs. Clinton has pledged that her policies would put the nation on a path to meeting that 2050 target. “The overwhelming view of the people who have looked at this is that there’s no way to get to the 2050 goal, and probably the near-term goal, without a carbon price,” said Jessica Tuchman Mathews, a former president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “At the very least, it would be like attempting to climb a very steep mountain with one leg tied behind your back.” Absent a carbon price, Mrs. Clinton plans to use a mix of new regulations, grant programs and spending on new infrastructure to achieve her targets. She would also spend $30 billion on a plan to help redevelop coal mining communities that are suffering economically in the wake of climate change policies. But experts say that such a piecemeal approach, while it would feasibly reduce emissions, would probably be less efficient and more expensive than the imposition of a single carbon price. It would also probably reach a point of diminishing returns because the Obama regulations have already affected the two most polluting industries. “She can continue to put out more rules,” Mr. Victor said. “But the Obama administration showed us the high-water mark for what is possible on climate change with executive authority.” And Mrs. Clinton would need at least some action by Congress to meet her goals — legislators would need to appropriate the $60 billion she intends to spend on clean infrastructure grants to states, and the $30 billion to help coal communities. Mrs. Clinton’s advisers say she is confident that Congress would appropriate the money because it would be funneled directly to states. Experts are skeptical. “It’s hard to see how she gets this kind of money from a public budget,” Mr. Victor said. Among environmental groups and the renewable energy industry, however, there is support for Mrs. Clinton’s proposals, however difficult they might be, compared with those of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump, who denies the established science of human-caused climate change. Even economists are sounding like realists. “The clearest and most obvious way to reach the climate targets is with a nationwide carbon pricing method, whether a carbon tax or a cap and trade,” said Robert Stavins, the head of the environmental economics program at Harvard University. “But it’s not surprising, given the politics, that Secretary Clinton would not want to explicitly talk about carbon pricing.”",

    "source": "Obama Puts Syria at Arm’s Length as Carnage Drags On <eos> WASHINGTON — When Secretary of State John Kerry took the floor at the United Nations on Wednesday to deliver a searing denunciation of the airstrike on an aid convoy headed for the Syrian city of Aleppo President Obama was crosstown, at his Manhattan hotel, preparing for a day of diplomacy that included Africa, Israel and Colombia — but, conspicuously, not Syria. It was typical of the arm’s-length approach the president has taken toward the Syria conflict on the world stage in recent weeks. At a summit meeting in China this month, he studiously avoided negotiating a cease-fire with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, leaving the diplomacy to Mr. Kerry and his Russian counterpart. At the United Nations, he scarcely mentioned Syria in a wide-ranging farewell address to the General Assembly. Mr. Obama’s public distancing, White House officials insist, does not reflect a lack of concern. On the contrary, they say the president is desperate for Mr. Kerry to negotiate a viable agreement with Russia that would halt the relentless bombing of civilians in Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria — if only because he does not see a viable Plan B to stop the carnage. But as Mr. Obama’s presidency enters its final months, the negotiations with Russia have become a threadbare exercise, leaving a president who has long avoided military entanglement with Syria backing a policy that he himself believes is destined to fail. This week, his frustration boiled over publicly. The situation in Syria “haunts me constantly,” the president said in an interview with the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin , published Thursday in Vanity Fair. In a mix of candor and defensiveness, Mr. Obama said he had second-guessed himself more on Syria than any other issue during his presidency. He repeated his rejection of critics who said he should have armed the moderate rebels much earlier in the conflict or carried through on his threat to take military action against the government of President Bashar al-Assad after he fired poison gas at civilians in 2013. But he conceded that there might have been a failure of imagination in his response to the conflict. “I do ask myself, ‘Was there something that we hadn’t thought of?’” the president told Ms. Goodwin. “‘Was there some move that is beyond what was being presented to me that maybe a Churchill could have seen, or an Eisenhower might have figured out?’” While Mr. Obama has supported Mr. Kerry’s diplomacy — even over the objections of the Pentagon — he does not want to be drawn into it. When Mr. Kerry met with Russia’s foreign minister , Sergey V. Lavrov, at a Group of 20 meeting in Hangzhou, China, on Sept. 4, the two fell just short of a cease-fire agreement over what officials said were minor details. American officials suspected the Russians were stalling so the deal could be sealed in a meeting the following day between Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin. After 90 minutes, a stone-faced Mr. Obama emerged to say , “Given the gaps of trust that exist, that’s a tough negotiation, and we haven’t yet closed the gaps in a way where we think it would actually work.” He instructed Mr. Kerry to keep talking to Mr. Lavrov, and the two came to terms five days later in Geneva. Mr. Obama, his aides said, was determined not to give Mr. Putin a platform to declare Russia was working hand in hand with the United States in Syria, particularly since he did not believe the Russians would abide by the terms of the agreement. “The president wasn’t prepared to offer the Russians what they wanted most — a symbolic show of U.S. cooperation — until the Russians delivered on their end of the bargain,” said the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest. “That’s why the bargain is structured the way it is. And it’s rooted in our skepticism that they would deliver.” “The president doesn’t want U.S. credibility to be sullied by Russia’s dishonesty and willingness to sacrifice principle in the name of convenience,” Mr. Earnest added. Mr. Obama’s skepticism appeared warranted when the aid convoy was hit by a warplane that American officials believe was Russian. White House officials reacted harshly. Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, said, “The question is whether or not we just walk away from the table completely at this point, or whether or not we do some more diplomacy and consultation to determine whether or not there is some path forward.” Again, though, Mr. Obama left it to Mr. Kerry to reproach Mr. Lavrov at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. To the extent he mentioned Syria during the General Assembly, it was in broad-brush humanitarian terms. At a meeting with other world leaders on the refugee crisis, Mr. Obama read a letter by a 6-year-old boy from Scarsdale, N.Y., who wrote to him to offer a home to Omran Daqneesh, the 5-year-old Syrian boy from Aleppo who was photographed, dazed and bloodied, after being rescued from an airstrike. The White House recorded the boy reading the letter aloud, and the video went viral on social media. Mr. Obama’s struggles with Syria are most palpable when he tries to sum up his foreign-policy legacy. In his speech to the General Assembly, for example, the president cited his diplomatic overtures to Cuba and Myanmar, as well as the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord, which he said exemplified the power of global collaboration. But when he referred to Syria, Mr. Obama spoke of constraints rather than possibilities. “If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,” he said, referring to Syria’s sectarian rifts. “I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts.” Mr. Obama made no direct reference to the negotiations with the Russians, saying only, “In a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won, we’re going to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, and deliver aid to those in need.” Several former administration officials said they understood why Mr. Obama was keeping his distance from the issue. “Frankly, I doubt Obama engaging on the diplomatic side would help much,” said Robert S. Ford, a former American ambassador to Damascus who is now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. “Like Kerry, Obama wouldn’t have much leverage with the tough-nosed Putin unless Obama was also putting into play in the Syria war new elements of material — not verbal — pressure against the Assad-Russia-Iran alliance.” Dennis B. Ross, a former coordinator of Middle East policy at the National Security Council, said Mr. Obama’s dilemma went back to the earliest days of his response to the Syria conflict, when he viewed it as a sectarian quagmire similar to that in neighboring Iraq. As the war ground on and the opposition became more Islamist, Mr. Obama’s options narrowed. Now, Mr. Ross said, the president has little incentive to say anything. “He knows that anything he says either requires him to do something if it is tough — and he won’t — or makes him look weak and ineffective on an issue that will plague his legacy,” he said.",

    "source": "Turkish Premier Says European Stance on Armenian Genocide Reflects Racism <eos> ISTANBUL — Turkey ’s prime minister on Friday accused Europe of showing signs of racism after the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on his government to recognize the mass killings of Armenians in the collapsing Ottoman Empire as genocide. Although Turkey vowed to disregard the resolution, government officials have lashed out at the European Parliament, the legislature of the European Union , accusing it of contriving obstacles to relations with Turkey. But the remarks by the prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, went further. “The European Parliament should not take decisions that would result in hatred toward a certain religion or ethnic group if it wants to contribute to peace,” Mr. Davutoglu told reporters in Ankara. “This issue is now beyond the Turkish-Armenian issue. It’s a new reflection of the racism in Europe.” The tensions came a week before Armenians across the world plan to commemorate the 100th anniversary of what historians recognize as the first genocide of the 20th century. Armenians say that as many as 1.5 million Armenian Christians were systematically killed from 1915 to 1923 through mass slaughter, starvation and deportation into the Syrian desert. While Turkey acknowledges that atrocities took place, it refuses to take responsibility for the deaths, claiming that a large number of people — many of them Turks — were also killed as a result of civil war and famine. Over the past century, all Turkish governments have vehemently rejected the term genocide. The debate over the characterization of the 1915 events gained momentum after Pope Francis described them as genocide on Sunday in a Mass to commemorate the killings. The statement caused a diplomatic uproar from Turkey, which recalled its ambassador to the Vatican. The European Parliament’s resolution on Wednesday calling on Turkey to normalize relations with Armenia and recognize the genocide further enraged the Turkish government. In a call with Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, Mr. Davutoglu urged Europe to look in its own backyard by opening up its archives on events affecting native tribes. “If we open the books on European history, there will be questions about what was done in Asia and Africa,” Mr. Davutoglu said. “What happened to the original tribes there? Where are the Aborigines? Where are the Native Americans?” He continued: “We never had ghettos. Ghettos are a European product. First there is ethnic discrimination, then there is genocide.” After the European Parliament’s vote, Mr. Davutoglu’s chief adviser, Etyen Mahcupyan, an ethnic Armenian, caused a bit of an uproar by appearing to break with the government’s opposition to use of the word genocide. “If you accept the events in Bosnia and Africa as genocide, it is impossible to call what happened to the Armenians in 1915 something else,” he said. A day after his statement, the prime minister’s office announced that Mr. Mahcupyan would be stepping down because he had reached retirement age.",

    "source": "A Second Frenchman Is Identified as Appearing in ISIS Beheading Video <eos> PARIS — Both were “boys next door” who recently converted to Islam and came under the spell of Islamic jihadists through the Internet. Both were apparently self-radicalized and traveled to Syria on their own. Both turned to the web to promote the Islamic State, with one posting images of a female Kurdish soldier’s severed head on his Twitter profile. “You Kurds, tell your wives to go back home, to play dolls, otherwise they will end up like this woman,” the post reads. Now both men, Michaël Dos Santos and Maxime Hauchard, have been identified by the authorities as French recruits who appeared, unmasked, in the prologue of a gruesome Islamic State video leading to the beheading of an American aid worker, Peter Kassig. The group has often guarded its members’ identities, so the two Frenchmen’s prominent place in the video served both as a reminder of the Islamic State’s success in recruiting disenchanted young Europeans, and as an advertisement seeking even more recruits. France was consumed by soul-searching Wednesday after French authorities confirmed that Mr. Dos Santos, 22, the Roman Catholic son of Portuguese immigrants from a working-class suburb east of Paris, had been paraded in front of the world as an Islamic State foot soldier. News media reports buzzed with disturbing entries from his Twitter accounts showing Mr. Dos Santos, a onetime avid soccer fan and dance enthusiast, dressed in combat gear. One of his Twitter posts showed an excerpt from the French national anthem, La Marseillaise, describing it as a “call for jihad.” Only days earlier, Mr. Hauchard, a middle-class 22-year-old from a village in Normandy in northern France who converted to Islam at 17, was identified as being among a group of executioners, wielding a knife near the neck of one of 18 Syrian prisoners killed in the video. To some observers here, that both men were recent converts who found meaning in turning their backs on France underscored the country’s failure to offer its young people a sense of hope for the future. Romain Caillet, an expert on radical Islamist groups, said that the images of the two young converts, with shaggy beards and violent ideology, had brought home to France how everyday citizens with nothing to lose were ripe for radicalism. The Fates of 23 ISIS Hostages in Syria Kayla Mueller was one of at least 23 foreign hostages from 12 countries who were kidnapped by Syrian insurgents, sold or handed over to the Islamic State, and held underground in a prison near the Syrian city of Raqqa. He said a growing and vocal minority of recruits to the Islamic State from France were converts to Islam, including from Catholic, atheist or nonreligious families. “Those who leave are often the most determined ones, or those who have nothing to lose,” Mr. Caillet said. “Many are single, unemployed and have broken ties with their families.” He added: “The big fishes are often Muslims of North-African descent. But converts play an important role.” Not least, such converts show that the grievances that have animated radical movements like the Islamic State may be more widely shared and could be used to recruit a broader pool of the discontented. Experts said the background of Mr. Dos Santos and Mr. Hauchard appeared to fit an alarming pattern in France and across Europe of young people from non-Muslim or nonreligious backgrounds being drawn into the lethal web of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS , through a mix of powerful jihadist propaganda videos and adolescent angst. France is struggling to deal with more than 1,000 citizens who have left or plan to travel to join the ranks of jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq. The government is so concerned about the consequences of young people becoming radicalized by the Islamic State and returning to France that it approved legislation this month to prevent suspected jihadists from leaving the country. Authorities say the extent to which the law has prevented any would-be jihadists from departing France was unclear. France has joined the United States-led airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and is also waging a propaganda offensive against the group, which claims to represent a caliphate — a state governed by strict Islamic principles. Mr. Dos Santos, who also went by the name Abu Othman, is believed to have left for Syria in 2013, around the same time as Mr. Hauchard. Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Wednesday that Mr. Dos Santos was “known for being involved in terrorism in Syria” and for his “violent behavior on social networks.” France 3, the television broadcaster, said Mr. Dos Santos, who was being tracked by French intelligence services, had five Twitter accounts. Mr. Caillet, the Islamic studies expert, follows Mr. Dos Santos on Twitter and said that he had posted photographs of himself dressed as a soldier. A remaining account was working Wednesday morning but appeared to have been suspended later. It did not contain any personal details, but it did include posts with verses of the Quran and photos of bombings and dead bodies, including the head of the female Kurdish soldier. Dominique Adenot, the mayor of Champigny-sur-Marne, where Mr. Dos Santos was born and had lived in recent years, said Mr. Dos Santos was the son of Portuguese parents, who were separated. The newspaper Le Monde reported that his mother and grandmother were cleaners. Iraqi Army Retakes Government Complex in Central Ramadi Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State. “He was so kind, so kind — they must have given him drugs,” his grandmother, Maria Dos Santos, told the newspaper, referring to the Islamic State. She said he had become radicalized through a Muslim friend and had begun to grow a beard. Mr. Adenot told reporters Wednesday that Mr. Dos Santos had become a French citizen in 2009, and had lived with his mother and his younger brother in a ramshackle four-story building. He said there was no radical mosques in Champigny. But Mr. Caillet, the Islamic expert, said the area where Mr. Dos Santos had lived in Champigny was a “ghetto,” where radical Islamist groups had spread in recent years, ensnaring lost and disenfranchised youths. News reports said that Mr. Dos Santos had been spotted by French intelligence in 2013 after a police crackdown on Islamic militants. Mr. Dos Santos appeared to have had links with some of the French jihadists arrested in the crackdown, authorities said. Mr. Hauchard appears to have followed a similar path as Mr. Dos Santos. Born in 1992, Mr. Hauchard lived in Bosc-Roger-en-Roumois, in Normandy, a quiet and middle-class town. He converted to Islam and went to Mauritania twice to study Islam. This year, Mr. Hauchard described in a Skype interview with BFM television how he had traveled freely to Syria and joined the Islamic State, which “established the laws of Allah on earth.” “It’s funny because in general people think that we have a sort of guru behind us that fills your head with stuff,” Mr. Hauchard said in the interview from Raqqa, the first Syrian city that fell entirely under rebel control. “But in fact I didn’t meet anyone. I would have loved to meet a brother.” In the video, Mr. Hauchard spoke from a barracks where he was living with about 40 people, “mostly Arabs,” he said, adding that he was being trained before “leaving for an operation.” “The personal objective of everybody here is the Shahid,” he said, using the Arabic word for martyr. “It’s the biggest reward.” On Monday, news reports quoted friends describing Mr. Hauchard as gentle, joyful and a regular mosquegoer. “He was never rebellious,” Philippe Vanheule, the mayor of Bosc-Roger-en-Roumois, told Le Monde. Mr. Vanheule denied that his town was fertile ground for would-be jihadists. “We have basketball, karaoke, judo, dance,” Mr. Vanheule said. “I don’t think that we have a lost youth here.”",

    "source": "Bears’ Forte Sees a Balanced Approach Against the Seahawks <eos> The last time the Chicago Bears played Seattle, they treated their running game as an afterthought and ended up with one of their worst losses of the season. Matt Forte does not see that happening again. The Bears will meet Seattle in a divisional playoff at Soldier Field on Sunday after orchestrating a turnaround that led to the N.F.C. North championship and a first-round bye. Forte was a big part of that. He ran for 717 yards over the final nine games — averaging 4.9 yards per carry, eighth in the league in that span — and if the Bears are going to beat the Seahawks , Forte said they would need to go with the same approach that led to their first playoff appearance in four years. That means more balance. “I don’t think we have a choice,” Forte said. “We can’t go out and do what we did last time and throw the ball 40 or 50 times and run the ball 10 times. We have to have a balanced offense.” It was hard to envision any of this after the first meeting between these teams in October. The Seahawks won, 23-20, at Soldier Field, sending Chicago to its second loss in a 1-3 stretch that nearly ruined its season. Forte was fifth in the N.F.L. at 5.8 yards per carry over the final six games, and his career-high 4.5 average for the season was the best by a Bears running back with 200 attempts since Neal Anderson in 1989 (4.7). The late surge gave Forte 1,069 yards rushing to go with 547 receiving, putting him alongside Walter Payton as the only Chicago players with at least 1,000 and 500 in the same season. “In the last five games, I don’t know if there’s a back playing better,” the offensive coordinator Mike Martz said. “He has always been really good, been very impressive, but about five weeks ago something happened.” HASSELBECK RETURNING? Seattle Coach Pete Carroll said the Seahawks would like to bring quarterback Matt Hasselbeck back for the 2011 season. Asked directly about Hasselbeck’s future with the franchise during his weekly news conference, Carroll said the team would like to do “everything we can” to have Hasselbeck return for an 11th season with the franchise. “We don’t know the timelines or how that’s going to work out, and all that kind of stuff, but that’s a big issue for us that we’re looking forward to,” Carroll said. “He’s had a terrific run for us, and we want to see what we can do to keep that going.” PACKERS PENALTIES Green Bay Packers Coach Mike McCarthy would emphasize penalties in practice and talk about discipline, only to watch the yellow flags fly again the next Sunday. More than three years’ worth of Packers penalty problems hit an all-time low in Week 3 this season, a miserable 18-penalty performance in a loss at Chicago. Since then, one of the league’s most penalty-prone teams suddenly became one of its most disciplined. Green Bay ended the regular season with 78 accepted penalties, tying for third-best in the N.F.L. “We’ve taken a different path this year,” McCarthy said. “They’ve had a lot of adversity, and they’ve done really a great job of buckling down on the discipline penalties.” Now the bad news for the Packers: The team they are playing Saturday night has even better discipline. The Atlanta Falcons committed only 58 penalties this season — tops in the N.F.L. by a significant margin; second-best Miami had 72. FOX MEETS WITH ELWAY John Fox finally arrived in Denver to meet with the Broncos about their head coaching vacancy after his flight out of North Carolina was delayed three times this week by winter weather. Fox met with John Elway , who is leading the team’s second head coaching search in two seasons. Fox’s contract was not renewed by the Panthers after a 2-14 season. FAVRE’S SISTER ARRESTED The police say the 34-year-old sister of Vikings quarterback Brett Favre faces drug charges after she was arrested in a raid on a Mississippi condo where people were making crystal methamphetamine. Maj. Matt Karl of the Hancock County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday that Brandi Favre was among five people arrested in Diamondhead.",

    "source": "Health Administrators to Reimburse State $7 Million in Duplicate Billing <eos> Two companies that administered health care for New York State Medicaid recipients have agreed to return $7 million that they received through duplicate billings, the state attorney general’s office said yesterday. The recovery stems from an audit of the state Medicaid program by the state comptroller in 2004, the attorney general’s office said. That audit found that in many cases Medicaid recipients had mistakenly been assigned more than one identification number from the program administrators. A later investigation by the attorney general and the state Medicaid inspector general found that once multiple identification numbers had been entered into computer systems, more than one bill was often paid for a single patient. In a statement, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said the problem had been “costing New York State taxpayers millions of dollars.” Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the State Health Department, said the companies did not do anything improper. “They worked off information they got from the government,” she said. Officials in Mr. Cuomo’s office said that the settlement was the first of a series expected in the coming months and estimated that the total amount returned to the programs could be more than $30 million. The programs affected are Medicaid, which provides health care for the poor, and Family Health Plus, a state health insurance program for people with limited income who might not qualify for Medicaid. Mr. Cuomo said his office and the inspector general were working with local social service agencies, which frequently assign the identification numbers, and the State Health Department to correct the problems that have led to multiple billings. He also said the health care companies that bill Medicaid — known as managed care organizations — have an obligation to monitor whether they charge more than once for each patient. Medicaid payments made to the managed care organizations have increased to more than $7 billion last year from $1 billion in 1996, the attorney general’s office said. As part of the settlement announced yesterday, one company, Healthfirst PHSP, has reimbursed the state about $6 million for duplicate payments received between July 2000 and November 2006, the attorney general’s office said. The payments were for nearly 6,000 individuals who had been assigned more than one identification number. A spokesman for Healthfirst, which is owned by 39 hospitals in New York City and Long Island, said the company had been working with state officials to correct the problem. “This is something that costs us money because we have to pay providers based on the number of people that are enrolled,” said the spokesman, Thomas W. Bergdall. “We are eager for the state to correct the problem.” The attorney general said the second company, St. Barnabas Community Health Plan, which was also known as Partners in Health, agreed to reimburse the state for $902,000 in duplicate billings since 2000. The company stopped operations last year. Ms. Hutton, the Health Department spokeswoman, said that the department was trying to change its computer programs to find the duplicate identification numbers and resolve the issue, but that there was no simple solution. “This is a problem that we have been aware of and we are working on it,” she said.",

Some 27 tons of flaming brown cheese, or brunost, a Norwegian delicacy, blocked a 1.9-mile tunnel near the northern town of Narvik when it caught fire last Thursday. The fire was finally put out on Monday. Brunost is made from whey and contains up to 30 percent fat. “This high concentration of fat and sugar is almost like petrol if it gets hot enough,” said Viggo Berg, a policeman.

    "source": "Trade for Shaq Looks Like a Blockbuster, But It Could Be a Bust <eos> On the eve of the N.B.A. draft , the Phoenix Suns sent Shaquille O’Neal to the Cleveland Cavaliers . Along with the stunning news of Michael Jackson’s death, O’Neal’s trade became the talk of the day. The Diesel and King James. A 15-time All-Star center teaming with LeBron James , the league’s most valuable player. Five years ago this would have qualified as a blockbuster, oh-my-god trade. Most of us would have said, “Engrave the championship trophy and give it to the Cavs.” In 2009, this trade has all the makings of a colossal bust. Mark Jackson , the former star of St. John’s and the Knicks and now an N.B.A. analyst, shrugged. “They’ve got to do something else,” Jackson said of Cleveland. “It’s not enough by itself. “It sounds good. But I thought Ali was going to beat Holmes.” Shaq hasn’t slipped as badly as the Muhammad Ali who fought Larry Holmes , but he may be headed in that direction. And the Shaq experiment could be the final act that prompts James to flee to New York. This is great for the N.B.A., of course. Shaq-LeBron is guaranteed to be the talk of the league from now until training camps open in the fall. For the last 10 years I’ve had running dialogue with Big Mike, the superintendent at the Prince Hall Apartments at 155th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem, U.S.A., about the sports news of the day. We usually see eye to eye. Not on this one. Mike is a LeBron fan and was ecstatic about the trade. “How’s Cleveland look right now?” he said. He pointed out that the Cavaliers didn’t give up much to get Shaq — Ben Wallace, Sasha Pavlovic, $500,000 and a second-round pick. Questioned about Shaq’s conditioning, he said, “If you get an in-shape Shaq, it’s a title.” But when was the last time he’s been in shape? “Wasn’t he in shape with Miami?” Mike said. “He’s got another swingman with him now, LeBron. So he’s got a reason to be in shape and stay in shape, too. If he comes in shape, nobody in the East can deal with him.” But even Big Mike conceded that Shaq’s work ethic has changed — dramatically. That’s what Kobe Bryant questioned near the end of their marriage in Los Angeles. I’ve changed my views of Shaq since he left the Lakers . The tension was thick between Shaq and Bryant. Bryant was cast as the villain, Shaq the victim. Shaq remains one of my favorite personalities, although the more I’ve seen Bryant, the clearer it has become that he wasn’t totally the bad guy. Those championship Lakers — 2000, 2001, 2002 — were impressive, largely because of how difficult it is for two young superstars to stick it out, and build and sustain a dynasty, in an era of free agency and obscene amounts of money. Shaq had us all charmed, while Bryant never will be mistaken for a charmer. At the end of their run, Bryant was criticizing Shaq’s work ethic and openly talking about his need for Shaq to be in better shape. Shaq went off to Miami and won a fourth championship in 2006. He was traded in 2008 to Phoenix, where, at times, he began to look like the Ali who fought Holmes . Who will Shaq be in Cleveland? He fancies himself as the wise big brother. He said problems with Bryant began when Kobe stopped listening. Miami succeeded because a young Dwyane Wade listened. In Phoenix, the veteran Suns didn’t need a big brother; they needed Shaq to play the pick and roll. In Cleveland, the Cavaliers will need Shaq to be in shape, be committed and driven. Big Mike was not moved. “I just see Shaq coming in, demanding the double team,” he said earnestly. “Even a not-in-shape Shaq demands a double team. You can’t focus on LeBron anymore.” And that, ultimately, may be the rub: How will LeBron deal with sharing the limelight he has commanded for five seasons? He is known as the consummate teammate, one of the most selfless superstars ever. But Shaq is a media magnet who commands attention. By next June, James’s selflessness will have been sorely tested — especially if there’s no championship. This could indeed be that match made in heaven. There’s an enormous LeBron James billboard across from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. His eyes are closed, his arms outstretched and his head raised toward the heavens almost as if in prayer. James might have been praying for a legitimate big man. Now he has Shaq. All I’ll say to King James is this: Be careful what you pray for.",

    "source": "New York City Can Require Sodium Warnings, Judge Rules <eos> Saying “information is power,” a judge on Wednesday upheld a measure in New York City requiring some restaurants to warn consumers about high levels of sodium in foods. The measure, which the Board of Health unanimously passed in September, applies only to restaurants with 15 or more locations nationwide. The restaurants were required to have the warnings up by Dec. 1, and fines were to go into effect on March 1. It required restaurants to place small images of saltshakers next to menu items high in salt. To earn the image, an item has to contain at least 2,300 milligrams of sodium — an amount many nutritionists say is the daily limit. Some chains in the city, like Subway, T.G.I. Friday’s, Applebee’s and the Regal Entertainment Group, have already begun abiding by the sodium-warning rule, which is the first of its kind in the country. The National Restaurant Association had sought a preliminary injunction to halt the measure. It said the board’s decision, which the association’s lawyer, S. Preston Ricardo, referred to as “the sodium mandate,” lacked legislative guidance or comment from affected businesses. Image The measure will require an icon of a salt shaker next to menu items that contain at least 2,300 milligrams of sodium, the amount that experts say should be a person’s total daily intake. Credit New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Arguing before Justice Eileen Rakower of State Supreme Court on Wednesday, Mr. Ricardo said that the targets of the sodium rule were arbitrary and capricious. “It doesn’t apply in a way that is logical or rational,” he said. Furthermore, he said, the measure would cause “irreparable harm” to chain restaurants by singling out their businesses — which he said might steer consumers to other places — rather than including all restaurants in the city. Thomas Merrill, the general counsel at the city’s health department, sought to contrast the requirement with the sugary drink ban — the highly contested measure proposed by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2012 that would have halted the sale of soft drinks larger than 16 ounces. That measure was ultimately rejected in court. “Warnings can be followed,” Mr. Merrill argued, “or they cannot be followed.” The sodium measure did not regulate, or ban, the sale of products with sodium in chain restaurants, he said; thus, it did not harm the “personal autonomy” of consumers’ choices. It also did not require a significant investment by chain restaurants, he said. High levels of sodium, he added, were linked to hypertension and heart disease, and, as a result, the board had the authority to warn consumers of its consumption. After Justice Rakower’s ruling, a spokeswoman for the restaurant association said it would be exploring all of its legal options, including an appeal.",

    "source": "Fish Tale Has DNA Hook: Students Find Bad Labels <eos> Many New York sushi restaurants and seafood markets are playing a game of bait and switch, say two high school students turned high-tech sleuths. In a tale of teenagers, sushi and science, Kate Stoeckle and Louisa Strauss, who graduated this year from the Trinity School in Manhattan , took on a freelance science project in which they checked 60 samples of seafood using a simplified genetic fingerprinting technique to see whether the fish New Yorkers buy is what they think they are getting. They found that one-fourth of the fish samples with identifiable DNA were mislabeled. A piece of sushi sold as the luxury treat white tuna turned out to be Mozambique tilapia, a much cheaper fish that is often raised by farming. Roe supposedly from flying fish was actually from smelt. Seven of nine samples that were called red snapper were mislabeled, and they turned out to be anything from Atlantic cod to Acadian redfish, an endangered species. What may be most impressive about the experiment is the ease with which the students accomplished it. Although the testing technique is at the forefront of research, the fact that anyone can take advantage of it by sending samples off to a laboratory meant the kind of investigative tools once restricted to Ph.D.’s and crime labs can move into the hands of curious diners and amateur scientists everywhere. The project began, appropriately, over dinner about a year ago. Ms. Stoeckle’s father, Mark, is a scientist and early proponent of the use of DNA bar coding, a technique that greatly simplifies the process of identifying species. Instead of sequencing the entire genome, bar coders — who have been developing their field only since 2003 — examine a single gene. Dr. Stoeckle’s specialty is birds , and he admits that he tends to talk shop at the dinner table. One evening at a sushi restaurant, Ms. Stoeckle recalled asking her father, “Could you bar code sushi?” Dr. Stoeckle replied, “Yeah, I think you could — and if you did that, I think you’d be the first ones.” Ms. Stoeckle, who is now 19, was intrigued. She enlisted Ms. Strauss, who is now 18. Their field technique was simple, Ms. Stoeckle said. “We ate a lot of sushi.” Or, as Dr. Stoeckle put it, “It involved shopping and eating, in which they were already fluent.” They hit 4 restaurants and 10 grocery stores in Manhattan. Once the samples were home, whether in doggie bags or shopping bags, they cut away a small piece and preserved it in alcohol. They sent those off to the University of Guelph in Ontario , where the Barcode of Life Database project began. A graduate student there, Eugene Wong, works on the Fish Barcode of Life (dubbed, inevitably, Fish-BOL) and agreed to do the genetic analysis. He compared the teenagers’ samples with the global library of 30,562 bar codes representing nearly 5,500 fish species. (Commercial labs will also perform the analysis for a fee.) Three hundred dollars’ worth of meals later, the young researchers had their data back from Guelph: 2 of the 4 restaurants and 6 of the 10 grocery stores had sold mislabeled fish. Dr. Stoeckle said he was excited to see a technology used in a new way. “The smaller and cheaper you make something,” he said, “the more uses it has.” He compared bar coding to another high-tech wonder turned everyday gadget, GPS. Eventually, he predicted, the process will become more automatic, cheaper and smaller so that a handheld device could perform a quick analysis and connect to the database remotely. What his daughter did, he said, is like dropping film off at the supermarket for developing. The next generation could be more like a digital camera that displays the results on the spot. The results of Ms. Strauss and Ms. Stoeckle’s research are being published in Pacific Fishing magazine, a publication for commercial fishermen. The sample size is too small to serve as an indictment of all New York fishmongers and restaurateurs, but the results are unlikely to be a mere statistical fluke. The experiment does serve as a general caveat emptor for fish lovers, particularly because the students, their parents and their academic mentor all declined to give the names of the vendors, citing fear of lawsuits. Besides, they noted, mislabeling could occur at any stage of the process. Dr. Stoeckle was willing to divulge the name of one fish market whose products were accurately labeled in the test: Leonards’ Seafood and Prime Meats on Third Avenue. John Leonard, the owner, said he was not surprised to find that his products passed the bar code test. “We go down and pick the fish out ourselves,” he said. “We know what we’re doing.” As for the technology, Mr. Leonard said, “it’s good for the public,” since “it would probably keep restaurateurs and owners of markets more on their toes.” Ms. Stoeckle said the underlying message of the research was simple: “If you’re paying for white tuna and you’re eating tilapia, I think you’d want to know that.” Although the students did not present the project for a grade at school, they made sure to mention it on their college applications. Both will enroll at Johns Hopkins University this fall. Neither, however, expects to major in the sciences. “I’ve always been into art history,” Ms. Strauss said, “which is really different from this.” Ms. Stoeckle, who is the granddaughter of the entertainer and arts patron Kitty Carlisle Hart , is thinking about studying writing or psychology . But that, they said, is the point. “If we found it interesting — which we did — I think lots of people like us can do it, too,” Ms. Stoeckle said. Peter B. Marko, a professor at Clemson University who used a more detailed genetic technique in a 2004 paper to show that red snapper was commonly mislabeled, called their project “quite remarkable,” though he added that genetic analysis had been simplified to the point that high school students could now perform the task without sending samples off. Mr. Marko prefers to work with whole genomes — “more information is better,” he explained — which can be sequenced now with lightning speed. He plans to perform a broad genetic comparison of fishes that were separated millions of years ago by the rise of the Isthmus of Panama. “The technology is allowing us to ask questions that really would not have been possible in the past.” The students worked under the tutelage of Jesse H. Ausubel of Rockefeller University , a champion of the DNA bar coding technique. As for Ms. Strauss and Ms. Stoeckle, Dr. Ausubel said they “have contributed to global science” by adding to the database, built on a model similar to that of Wikipedia , in which people around the world can contribute. In a way, Dr. Ausubel said, their experiment is a return to an earlier era of scientific inquiry. “Three hundred years ago, science was less professionalized,” he said, and contributions were made by interested amateurs. “Perhaps the wheel is turning again where more people can participate.”",

The shootings took place on Tuesday after Tibetans had gathered to protest the detention the previous day of a respected village leader, known as Wangdak, who had insisted to local officials that Tibetans be allowed to hold a traditional prayer ceremony before a horse festival. The reports, citing Tibetans in exile, said the police fired tear gas and live ammunition. Wangdak’s son and brother were among those injured, Radio Free Asia reported. The violence took place in Ganzi Prefecture in Sichuan Province, known to Tibetans as Kardze.

Democrats had challenged the law, describing it as one in a long series that Republicans in several states had enacted to suppress voting by blacks and Hispanics, who are more likely than others to vote early and to vote Democratic. Republicans denied that charge, saying the law combated voter fraud. Judge Michael H. Watson, of Federal District Court in Cincinnati, wrote in his findings that voter fraud was very rare and that the law did nothing to prevent it. It is unclear what effect the ruling will have on turnout. Republicans would not say immediately whether they would appeal, but they noted that even with the provision the judge struck down, Ohio had one of the longest early voting periods in the United States, starting four weeks before an election. Early voting in Ohio grew out of the 2004 election, when people stood in line for hours to cast ballots, particularly in heavily minority and Democratic urban areas. Thousands went home without voting. George W. Bush carried the state by 2.1 percentage points. If he had lost it, John Kerry would have become president. State law was then changed to allow any voter to get an absentee ballot without offering a reason, and to open early voting — by mail or by dropping off a ballot in person — 35 days before an election. Ohio requires voters to register at least 30 days before an election, so the change created a window, known as Golden Week, when registration and voting were underway. With a single visit to a county elections office, a person could register, get an absentee ballot, fill it out and cast it. In 2014, the Republican-controlled General Assembly and Gov. John Kasich, also a Republican, enacted a law eliminating Golden Week; early voting would start after registration had closed. Judge Watson cited an expert witness called by Democrats who testified that black voters were far more likely than others to vote early and in person, and that voting during Golden Week in presidential elections was more than five times as prevalent in overwhelmingly black census blocks as in overwhelmingly white ones. Curtailing early voting and eliminating Golden Week “will disproportionately burden African-Americans,” in violation of the Voting Rights Act, wrote Judge Watson, who was appointed by Mr. Bush and served in the 1990s as counsel to a Republican governor, George Voinovich. Another federal judge made a similar ruling in 2014, but the Supreme Court blocked it , and the case was later settled. “The racial impact just sticks out like such a sore thumb,” said David A. Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, which had challenged the law. “I certainly don’t think that’s an accident.” The judge upheld other restrictions imposed by the state that Democrats had also challenged, like limiting early voting to one location per county and reducing the number of voting machines counties are required to have. Mr. Kasich’s office referred questions to Secretary of State Jon Husted, the elected official who oversees elections. Mr. Husted, a Republican, said he would consult with legislative leaders about how to proceed. Noting that “for nearly 200 years, Ohioans voted for only one day,” Mr. Husted said, “If it was constitutional for lawmakers to expand the voting period to 35 days, it must also be constitutional for the same legislative body to amend the time frame to 28 days.” In the 2012 presidential election, state officials said, about 80,000 people voted in person during Golden Week, or 1.4 percent of the total, and 14,000 of those ballots were cast by people who registered the same day. No one could say how many of them would have voted if the week were eliminated.",

    "source": "New Offshore Bank Limits for U.S. Clients, UBS Says <eos> WASHINGTON — Faced with a federal investigation into its private banking practices, the Swiss banking giant UBS said on Thursday that it would stop offering offshore banking services to clients in the United States. Mark Branson, chief financial officer of the UBS global wealth management group, told a Senate subcommittee that the company would provide banking or securities services to United States residents only through companies licensed in this country and that it would help the federal government identify American citizens engaging in tax fraud. On Wednesday, a Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations released a report saying that UBS’s offshore practices helped American citizens hide an estimated $18 billion in 19,000 accounts from the Internal Revenue Service . In his testimony, Mr. Branson apologized for any compliance failures that might have happened and said the decision to close its Switzerland-based cross-border business was intended to ensure that such failures did not happen again. Clients in the United States will still be able to access UBS’s services through wealth management units that are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But advisers based in Switzerland will not be allowed to come to the United States to meet with American clients. UBS’s decision came as a surprise even to Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, the subcommittee chairman, who said in his opening statement that UBS operated “behind a wall of secrecy” that needed to be torn down. “I thought we were ready for any possibility,” Mr. Levin said after the hearing. “It turns out we weren’t.” The committee also heard taped testimony from Heinrich Kieber, a former employee of LGT, a bank owned by the royal family of Liechtenstein. Mr. Kieber supplied details about LGT account holders to the I.R.S. and other countries. The subcommittee’s report said that both LGT and UBS helped Americans avoid taxes by setting up convoluted foreign-owned offshore accounts whose assets did not have to be reported to the I.R.S. That practice by LGT, UBS and other offshore companies costs the Treasury Department $100 billion annually in lost taxes, Mr. Levin said. Both LGT and UBS have what are known as qualified intermediary agreements with the I.R.S., which were established in 2001 to allow the revenue service to collect taxes with the help of foreign banks. But those agreements do not mandate the reporting of accounts held by non-American citizens or companies, a loophole that Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota and the ranking subcommittee member, said that LGT and UBS had exploited. Douglas H. Shulman, the I.R.S. commissioner, testified that his agency was strengthening the qualified intermediary program. He asked Congress for more time to audit offshore accounts that might have been used for tax evasion. But Mr. Levin and Mr. Coleman indicated that they would most likely seek legislative solutions. The federal tax investigation initially focused on Bradley C. Birkenfeld, an American and a former top UBS executive, who pleaded guilty in June to a single fraud charge of helping an American citizen conceal $200 million in assets from the I.R.S. In May, federal authorities detained Martin Liechti, a Swiss citizen and senior UBS official, in Miami in connection with the investigation. Mr. Liechti appeared before the subcommittee Thursday, but declined to testify, citing his Fifth Amendment rights. Mr. Levin commended UBS for changing its business practices. “We can’t reach all the banks,” he said. “We have reached yours. That represents progress.” LGT declined a request to testify before the subcommittee, though a senior official from the company did meet with subcommittee staff members last Friday. This week, the company sent a letter to the subcommittee refusing to testify, saying it had complied with its qualified intermediary agreement. The letter also said that company representatives would be severely limited in what they could say because of the principality’s strict disclosure laws. Mr. Kieber, who is in a witness protection program, is accused of breaking those laws. With his face disguised on the videotape, Mr. Kieber told the subcommittee that LGT had used sophisticated methods to avoid detection by American tax authorities. LGT customers were advised to use only public phones to contact the bank, and the company mailed correspondence from nearby Austria or Switzerland, he said. Michael Robinson, a spokesman for LGT, said in an e-mail statement to a reporter that the documents Mr. Kieber supplied dated “back to a time when the regulatory environment was completely different.” Shannon Marsh of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and William Wu of Forest Hills in Queens, whose LGT accounts were examined in the subcommittee report, declined to answer the subcommittee’s questions, invoking their Fifth Amendment rights. According to the subcommittee report, Mr. Marsh hid millions of dollars in four foundations in Liechtenstein, while LGT helped Mr. Wu orchestrate a fake sale of his house to his own offshore company. Steven Greenfield of New York refused to appear after being subpoenaed. Peter S. Lowy of Beverly Hills, Calif., will testify before the committee next Friday.",

    "source": "Alaska Lawmakers to Seek Subpoenas in Palin Inquiry <eos> ANCHORAGE — Senior lawmakers in the Alaska State Legislature said Friday that they would seek subpoenas to compel seven witnesses to answer questions in an ethics inquiry into whether Gov. Sarah Palin , the Republican nominee for vice president, improperly put pressure on state officials to dismiss her former brother-in-law, a state trooper. The lawmakers overseeing the inquiry said the investigator would deliver a final report by Oct. 10 to allow both sides ample time to respond before the presidential election. Ms. Palin, after pledging for weeks that she would cooperate with the investigation, has in recent days begun to challenge the Legislature’s jurisdiction in the inquiry. The list of people the investigator is seeking to question — including a top Palin aide, the state personnel director and the cabinet-level commissioner of administration — indicates that the inquiry is focusing on accusations that the governor’s office unlawfully breached the personnel file of the trooper, Mike Wooten. He has had a particularly contentious divorce and custody battle with Ms. Palin’s sister. Separately, the state troopers’ union lodged an ethics complaint this week against Ms. Palin and members of her administration, alleging that they had unlawfully gained access to Mr. Wooten’s personnel file. The pursuit of the subpoenas, which are scheduled for a vote before a joint hearing of the Alaska House and Senate Judiciary Committees next Friday, increased tensions in the ethics controversy embroiling Ms. Palin as she seeks to become vice president. The case seems certain to play out under the glare of the presidential campaign and amid considerable rancor between the governor’s office and the Legislature. Lawmakers said they were forced to seek subpoenas after the seven witnesses abruptly canceled appointments this week to be deposed by the Legislature’s investigator, Stephen Branchflower, a longtime Anchorage prosecutor. The lawmakers asserted that Ms. Palin’s lawyer, Thomas V. Van Flein, had forbidden members of her administration to have any contact with the investigator. “That is a misrepresentation of what is going on,” Mr. Van Flein said. “There are several witnesses who have their own lawyers, and they took their own positions.” He added, “My client is just waiting to tell her side of the story, but we’re not going to do it secretly, in a closed room.” The ethics controversy stems from Ms. Palin’s dismissal in July of Walt Monegan, the public safety commissioner, in what he has said was retaliation for his refusal to dismiss Mr. Wooten. Ms. Palin has accused Mr. Wooten of threatening her family and drinking while driving his patrol car. The governor denies that Mr. Monegan’s dismissal was related to Mr. Wooten’s case. The increasingly adversarial relationship between the lawmakers supervising the inquiry and Ms. Palin’s office stands in sharp contrast with the spirit of cooperation she had promised to bring to the inquiry, even as she questioned the need for an outside investigator. “I’m happy to comply, to cooperate,” Ms. Palin told the Anchorage television station KTUU in late July. “I have absolutely nothing to hide, no problem with an independent investigation.” In early August she said, “We are very, very open to answering any questions anybody has of me or my administrators.” But on Aug. 29, the day that Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, named Ms. Palin to his ticket, her lawyer, Mr. Van Flein, sent a letter to the state-appointed investigator asserting that, though he would cooperate with the Legislature’s inquiry, the accusations should be investigated by the state personnel board. According to the letter, obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Van Flein argued that state law made the personnel board “properly vested with primary jurisdiction.” Ms. Palin took the extraordinary step Tuesday of filing an ethics complaint against herself, making the matter fall within the bailiwick of the personnel board. Mr. Van Flein then asked the Legislature to drop its inquiry. The three members of the personnel board are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature. The proceedings of the board are conducted in secret, in contrast with the public deliberations of the Legislature. “It seems obvious that the governor’s approach to the legislative investigation changed radically after she was chosen to be the Republicans’ vice-presidential nominee,” said Mike Doogan, a Democratic state lawmaker from Anchorage. Taylor Griffin, a spokesman for the McCain-Palin campaign, said the governor had been cooperative and criticized the tenor of the investigation. “What was intended as a nonpartisan review has become a political circus,” Mr. Griffin said. On Friday, a Republican in the Legislature, John Coghill of North Pole, demanded that the Democrat overseeing the investigation, Senator Hollis French of Anchorage, give up his role, accusing him of bias. In a letter to the chairman of the legislative panel that authorized the investigation, Mr. Coghill focused on comments Mr. French had made in the press suggesting that the inquiry was “likely to be damaging to the administration” and suggesting that it could lead to impeachment. “These statements cause me to think that the report is already written even though the investigation is only just begun and the most important witnesses have not even been interviewed,” the letter says. “The investigation appears to be lacking in fairness, neutrality and due process.” In an interview in his Anchorage office on Friday, Mr. French acknowledged that he had improperly speculated about possible outcomes of the case and expressed regret. He maintained that the investigation had been insulated from political pressure, and he emphasized that he was not conducting the investigation but rather was acting as the Legislature’s liaison to Mr. Branchflower. Mr. French dismissed suggestions that partisanship and the injection of the presidential race were coloring the investigation. He noted that 8 of the 12 members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees who were to vote on the subpoenas next week were Republicans. The seven witnesses who would be subpoenaed include some of Ms. Palin’s primary aides. At the top of the list is Frank Bailey, who in February was recorded while telephoning a trooper commander to relay that the governor and her husband, Todd Palin, were unhappy that Mr. Wooten was still on the force. Ms. Palin subsequently said Mr. Bailey had acted improperly, and she placed him on unpaid leave. In an interview Friday, Jay Ramras, a Republican who is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in Alaska, said Mr. Bailey was being placed on leave to free him to cooperate with the investigation. Mr. Bailey’s decision to cancel his deposition helped prompt the pursuit of the subpoenas, Mr. Ramras said. “We took great offense that Frank Bailey bailed out of the interview at the moment he was scheduled,” Mr. Ramras said. “In elementary school terms, we feel like he started it.” The others on the list to receive subpoenas, Mr. French said, are Dianne Kiesel, the former director of the Division of Personnel and Labor Relations; Nicki Neal, the current director of the division, which oversees the personnel board; Brad Thompson, director of risk management; Annette Kreitzer, the commissioner of the Department of Administration, a cabinet position; Karen Rehfeld, the state budget chief; and Kris Perry, director of Ms. Palin’s Anchorage office. The lawmakers said they would not send the governor a subpoena, owing to her public pledge to cooperate and to her busy schedule.",

    "source": "In International Soccer, Just One Wish: Stay Healthy <eos> LONDON — A wise old soccer trainer, Liverpool’s Bob Paisley, once said that long-haul flights were like putting kerosene in a player’s gasoline tank. Paisley is gone now, and flying is a very different experience than it was 30 years ago. But some 1,100 players have just been transported around the globe to represent their countries for matches in the middle of this week. Once those games end, they will be flown straight back for their club games this weekend. Shinji Kagawa comes to mind as an especially coveted, yet vulnerable, individual. He came back, quite remarkably, from a torn ankle ligament to play 87 minutes for Borussia Dortmund against Hanover last Sunday. He then boarded a plane, together with other Japanese players based in Germany, for the 14-hour journey to Tokyo. If all goes as planned, Kagawa will represent his country for a home match Wednesday against Uzbekistan, in the Japanese city of Toyota. Then he will gather his travel bag and make the return flight, hoping to play his part for Dortmund, the German league leader, in its game against Mainz on Saturday. “I am on my way to the airport now,” Kagawa wrote on his personal Web site after the Bundesliga game. “As far as the injury goes, pain and swelling are no longer the issue. Though the time is limited, I’ll prepare to be the best of who I am, and get on to the game.” Playing a game the day after arriving, Kagawa told Nikkan Sports, is a bit worrying. But he said he would give everything he could. A matter of hours before the game Sunday, neither Kagawa nor anyone else knew if his ankle would withstand one game in a week, never mind three games separated by travel to the other side of the world and back. The tear in Kagawa’s ligament was, apparently, only partial. He was up and running, though unable to kick a ball or risk a challenge five days before the Hanover match. When Kagawa is ready, he is a sure starter for Dortmund, the most consistently creative player on the team, some say. His game, bursting forward from midfield to score or set up goals, demands energy. Fans come from Japan just to see him in the flesh, and with a smile on his face, he responds to them on and off the field. At 22, Kagawa has ambitions to go right to the very top. Why not? Manchester United was known to follow his progress until a previous injury — a broken metatarsal while representing Japan at the 2011 Asian Cup — knocked him out of the second half of the Bundesliga season last year. United likes players from Asia, and just a week ago it rewarded Park Ji-sung, its South Korean midfielder, with the captain’s armband for a Europa League match. Park, crucially, reached 100 caps for his country and then opted to retire from the national team. He figured he had done his bit living the two-way split between club and country. The rending of flesh, the breaking of bone, the sheer fatigue of up to 60 games a calendar year for club, and a dozen or more for country, can only take so much. UEFA is signing off on an agreement with Europe’s top clubs to cancel the August national team games that interrupt the vital preseason club preparations. The issue, however, will not go away. Look how many star players have been withdrawn, with one medical complaint or another, from the 10 World Cup qualifying games being played in Asia and Australasia this week for the 2014 tournament. And look at the scores of withdrawals from the dozens of money-raising friendly internationals that are scattered across all continents. National teams, of course, must have some preparatory dates, but FIFA and UEFA have pushed the demands for their ever-expanding tournaments to the breaking point. Everyone — the clubs, the nations, the sponsors — want more and more from the ever-shorter time available in a player’s career. I return to Kagawa simply because he is such a talented and willing young man, with the world at his feet, provided he can stay fit and enthusiastic. He apparently dreamed of this from the age of 5, when sports clubs around Kobe, Japan, noticed his dynamic ability. He rose ahead of his age group until a former German professional player became his agent and arranged his move in 2010 from Cerezo Osaka to Dortmund for a predetermined, cut-rate price of €350,000, or $470,000. He would be worth, conservatively, 20 times that amount on the global market today. His immediate future is in the hands of two coaches, neither of whom would knowingly be reckless with his injuries. Jürgen Klopp, his coach at Dortmund, had a full, if relatively modest playing career before taking Borussia to the very top of the Bundesliga last year. Japan’s coach, Alberto Zaccheroni, lost his playing career to injury, but that only increased his desire to coach top players. Zaccheroni has been taking care of players since 1983, and he was the Japan team coach when Kagawa was injured during the Asian Cup semifinal in Qatar in January 2011. The medical team will examine the player when he arrives in Toyota. Air travel has substantially improved, especially in the premium seats at the front of the plane, since Paisley’s time. Even so, a joint can swell and stiffen during a long-haul flight. And before Zaccheroni picks his team, he will want to consider the health of every player and the fact that the match Wednesday against Uzbekistan is hardly a make-or-break game for anyone. Both sides have already qualified for the next stage of the Asian qualifying process. Uzbekistan is traveling without half of its best players because of suspensions and injuries, and because the contest in Toyota is of relatively little consequence to it. Japan will doubtless put pride on home soil somewhat higher. But Dortmund’s message to Kagawa will be: Safe journey, and come back whole.",

The speech by the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has become known for his baldly anti-Israel and anti-Semitic remarks, came as tensions had been intensifying with Israel, which regards Iran’s nuclear program as an existential threat. Speculation has raged in the Israeli press about whether the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to order a military strike on uranium enrichment sites in Iran that Israel suspects are part of a clandestine effort to build nuclear weapons . Iran contends that its uranium enrichment is peaceful. Mr. Ahmadinejad’s speech, as reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency, added some new and incendiary flourishes to a theme he had pushed for his entire presidency. “The very existence of the Zionist regime is an insult to humankind and an affront to all world nations,” the news agency’s English-language report on the speech quoted him as saying. “Confronting Zionists will also pave the way for saving the whole humankind from exploitation, depravity and misery.” In another passage, Mr. Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying that Jerusalem Day, which the Iranians call Quds Day after the city’s Arabic name, was “an occasion for all human communities to wipe out this scarlet letter, meaning the Zionist regime, from the forehead of humanity.” A violently anti-Israel message was also the theme of Jerusalem Day commemorations in Beirut, Lebanon, the home base of Hezbollah, the militant political organization that fought a war with Israel in 2006 and is aligned with the governments of Iran and Syria in what they call the axis of resistance. Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah secretary general, said in a televised speech that its arsenal of missiles trained on Israel included precision-guided rockets that could transform “the lives of hundreds of thousands of Zionists into hell.” Israel considers Iran its most dangerous adversary because of Iran’s suspect nuclear program, missiles capable of hitting Israeli targets, and support for militant Palestinian groups on Israel’s borders. Conversely, Iran’s clerical rulers have considered Israel one of the world’s most arrogant and dangerous powers since they came to power in the Islamic revolution of 1979. Iranian officials constantly point out that even though they repudiate nuclear weapons, Israel has an arsenal of them. Both Mr. Ahmadinejad and Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have regularly excoriated Israel’s existence, but Israel harbors particular antipathy toward Mr. Ahmadinejad, who has denied the Holocaust and predicted in a speech early in his tenure that Israel would one day be “wiped off the map.”",

    "source": "Yonkers Police Officer Acquitted in Body-Slamming Case <eos> WHITE PLAINS (AP) — A Yonkers police officer who was caught on video apparently body-slamming a woman to a restaurant’s tile floor was acquitted on Wednesday of violating her civil rights. Jurors in federal court in White Plains found the officer, Wayne Simoes, 39, not guilty after a five-day trial and five hours of deliberation. Several times during the trial, jurors were shown a recording from a restaurant surveillance camera that seemed to show the officer lifting the woman, Irma Marquez, 44, by her waist and throwing her face-first to the floor. The takedown knocked her unconscious and broke her jaw. Officer Simoes seemed stunned when the verdict was read. He expelled his breath loudly several times, then wiped his eyes with a tissue and hugged his lawyers and his wife. Several of the two dozen off-duty Yonkers police officers in the gallery clapped each other on their backs. The officers then assembled outside the courtroom and applauded Officer Simoes, the jurors and the defense lawyer, Andrew Quinn, as they walked out. Mr. Quinn said that by showing the jurors stills from the video of the night in question — March 3, 2007 — he was able to prove that the takedown of Ms. Marquez was an accident and that Officer Simoes had “no intent or desire to hurt Ms. Marquez or violate her civil rights.” Officer Simoes said that he felt bad for Ms. Marquez. He thanked his lawyers, his wife, his colleagues and everyone who “saw through all the garbage.” Mr. Quinn had claimed during the trial that the soundless, dimly lighted video was misleading because it caught only 15 frames per second. He said Officer Simoes was simply trying to keep Ms. Marquez from interfering with medical technicians who were treating her niece after a bar fight. He said Ms. Marquez was “stumbling drunk.” Ms. Marquez, of Yonkers, was arrested at the scene but acquitted of obstruction charges. She is suing the city’s Police Department for $11 million. The police captain at the scene, Edward Geiss, testified that at the time, he thought Officer Simoes’s action “probably involved excessive force.” On the other hand, he said, he did not think the officer intended to hurt Ms. Marquez “the way he did.” Officer Simoes was acquitted of violating Ms. Marquez’s constitutional protection from excessive police force. Had he been convicted, he could have faced up to 10 years in prison. The Justice Department has been investigating charges of brutality against the Yonkers force since long before the body-slam incident.",

    "source": "Favorite Concedes Presidency in Romania <eos> BUCHAREST, Romania — In a surprising turnaround, Prime Minister Victor Ponta conceded Romania’s presidential runoff election late Sunday night to the center-right candidate, Klaus Iohannis, the mayor of the Transylvanian city of Sibiu. When the last votes were cast at 9 p.m., exit polls had the election too close to call, but soon after 11, Mr. Ponta told reporters, “I called Klaus Iohannis to congratulate him for his victory.” He added, “The people are always right.” Official results were not expected before Monday morning. Mr. Ponta, 42, had long been the favorite. He led Mr. Iohannis, 40 percent to 30 percent, in the first round, but with no one winning a majority in a field of 14 candidates the race went into a runoff. The outcome of the runoff seems to have hinged on the large Romanian diaspora, estimated to number four million. In the first round of the election, which took place on Nov. 2, a large number of Romanians living abroad were unable to vote despite waiting in line for hours. Protests followed, and last Monday the foreign minister, Titus Corlatean, was forced to resign. Yet starting early Sunday morning, long lines formed outside embassies and consulates across Europe. The number of people voting abroad doubled between the two rounds, and some were left waiting for hours and were still unable to vote. “After nine hours and 10 minutes of waiting I gave up,” Ancuta Iordachescu, a photographer who tried to vote at the embassy in Paris, wrote in an email. In reaction, thousands of Romanians took to the streets of Bucharest and other cities in protest, blaming Mr. Ponta for the delays and waving banners that read “Let them vote” and shouting “Ponta resign!” “Ponta is breaking the rules — Romanians outside the country must be allowed to vote,” said Andrea Beltic, who stood outside the main government building. Mr. Iohannis, 55, an ethnic German, ran what many considered a lackluster campaign. Yet voters seem to have decided that he was the better option. “Ponta tried to present himself as a progressive leader, but he failed to convince people,” said Cristian Ghinea, director of the Romanian Center for European Policies, a research group. Mr. Ponta tried to make an issue of his opponent’s religion — Mr. Iohannis is an Evangelical Lutheran in a country that is largely Orthodox — and that he and his wife had decided not to have children. “Iohannis did a poor job in the two debates, but Ponta mobilized the people against himself,” Mr. Ghinea said. “He ran a dirty campaign which blew up in his face.” In the first round, 52 percent of the 18 million eligible voters voted. It was estimated that around 62 percent voted this time, which according to Mr. Ghinea was the highest turnout in the last three presidential elections. Romania’s president is responsible for foreign policy, defense and the naming of key prosecutors. Mr. Iohannis has vowed to make corruption a priority. The current president, Traian Basescu, appointed Laura Codruta Kovesi to lead Romania’s National Anticorruption Directorate, and her office has successfully prosecuted many luminaries of Romania’s political class, including a former prime minister who had been considered Mr. Ponta’s mentor. Some had feared those efforts would be hindered if Mr. Ponta won. Mr. Ponta’s party, the Social Democrats, has a working majority in Parliament, and he remains prime minister, so he and Mr. Iohannis will have to try to find a way to work together, probably until the next parliamentary elections in 2016. “I see a difficult cohabitation between Ponta and Iohannis going forward,” Mr. Ghinea said.",

    "source": "Texas Trial Lawyers’ Support of Republicans Yields Mixed Results <eos> Trial-lawyer-backed is a label ready-made for Republicans’ attack ads in tort-reform-happy Texas. But if the 2012 primaries are any guide, the plaintiffs’ bar is becoming less shy about investing in the Republican side of the ballot — and Republican candidates are not being bashful about accepting the money. The jury is still out on whether the stigma about trial lawyers is fading for Republican voters. Steve Mostyn, the immediate past president of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association, who has contributed millions to largely Democratic causes, gave hundreds of thousands to three Republican State Senate contests this election cycle. Texans for Insurance Reform — a political action committee to which Mr. Mostyn, a Houston personal injury lawyer, is the largest donor — followed suit. (Mr. Mostyn and his wife, Amber, are donors to The Texas Tribune. The Texas Trial Lawyers Association is a corporate sponsor of The Tribune.) The effort is trial lawyers’ largest foray into Republican primary races in the past decade, and results have been mixed. Two of the State Senate candidates whom Mr. Mostyn and T.I.R. backed heavily, Representative Todd Smith of Euless and Dave Norman of Seabrook, lost handily to opponents who had received money from Texans for Lawsuit Reform, the state’s largest and richest tort-reform group. “For every vote you might get by spending the money, you lose one as well,” because of its source, said Representative Kelly Hancock of North Richland Hills, who defeated Mr. Smith by 30 percentage points. Mr. Smith, a Fort Worth personal injury lawyer, had received nearly $450,000 from T.I.R. by May 20. Mr. Hancock had taken in a similar amount from tort reform advocates. In Mr. Norman’s matchup against Representative Larry Taylor of Friendswood, Mr. Mostyn spent $275,000 of his own money on behalf of Mr. Norman, an insurance agent; T.I.R. gave $368,000. A third group backed by trial lawyers, the Conservative Voters of Texas, run by Mark McCaig, a former State Republican Executive Committee member and an associate in Mr. Mostyn’s law firm, invested another $228,000. T.L.R. and two supporters, Bob and Doylene Perry, gave more than $900,000 to Mr. Taylor’s campaign. (Bob Perry is a donor to The Tribune). Mr. McCaig — who is also behind Texans for Individual Rights — said that to begin with, both of those races were “uphill battles.” Much of the trial lawyers’ investment, he said, came as an attempt to give the candidates “a fighting chance.” “Being able to decrease the influence of a powerful group like T.L.R. is not going to happen overnight,” he said. Sherry Sylvester, a T.L.R. spokeswoman, said that Mr. McCaig’s group was deceptive and that the losses by candidates backed by trial lawyers sent a clear signal. “A message that’s paid for by trial lawyers, no matter how much money is behind it, is not going to persuade conservative Republican voters,” Ms. Sylvester said. But trial lawyers did have one bright spot on Tuesday. That came in a third senate race, with the dispatch of the former Railroad Commissioner Elizabeth Ames Jones, who as of April 30 had received more than $700,000 from T.L.R. since December, plus an additional $100,000 from Bob and Doylene Perry. Ms. Jones’s opponent, Senator Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio got more than $640,000 from the T.I.R. PAC and will face a runoff with Donna Campbell, once considered the long-shot candidate, in July. Mr. Wentworth shrugged off the notion that trial lawyer money might be a liability in a Republican primary, saying the outcome of his race “speaks for itself.” He said he supported lawsuit reform but that he had opposed the tort-reform group when he thought it had behaved dishonestly in negotiations. “That kind of independence really aggravates them,” he said. “When they say jump, they want me and every other member of the Legislature to say how high.”",

    "source": "Soup Burg Closes on Upper East Side <eos> Halfway around the world, my 6-year-old son could feel the pull of the Soup Burg’s eggs and sausage, the meal he would have ordered every time, in every restaurant, if he could. So when we arrived home after more than a year away, we headed straight to East 77th Street and Lexington Avenue, where we were confronted with terrible news: The Soup Burg was closing down. Behind the counter last Sunday night, the restaurant’s last, Jimmy Gouvakis’s face drooped, like the ends of his mustache, beneath his faded Soup Burg ball cap. The landlord had not even named a price, he said: “It was just, ‘Get out.’ He’s putting in a TD Bank.” Epicures may have shuddered last month when soaring commercial real estate prices cost the celebrity restaurateur Danny Meyer the lease on his famed Union Square Cafe, but Soup Burg is a workingman’s version, and Mr. Gouvakis, 54, doesn’t have Mr. Meyer’s Shake Shack empire to fall back on. His predicament represents a broader challenge to the fabric of New York: the loss of affordable mom-and-pop shops in Manhattan neighborhoods that once, not so long ago, were not solely for the extraordinarily wealthy. On the Upper East Side, it is hard to say who is disappearing faster, rent-stabilized tenants (like me and my parents before me) or the small-business owners who long catered to them. “It’s going from a family neighborhood to a corporate neighborhood,” Mr. Gouvakis said, though most would probably say it has already gone. The Soup Burg is — was — the archetype of what in today’s homogenized, all-American city is usually called a diner. Premillennial, pre-Starbucks New Yorkers would call it a coffee shop. Not the kind where you get a latte, though that item was grudgingly added to the menu. The kind where you get a burger bigger than its bun, or home fries with sweet peppers and onions, or a chicken orzo soup with saltines. Where you can sit down and eat for $10, with a bottomless, not distractingly good $1.50 coffee, and where they know your face, your order and sometimes even your name. On that final Sunday, nothing looked different. The pink faces of halved grapefruits stared from a glass case. The stainless-steel counters gleamed. The grill cooks flattened sandwiches with a device that resembled an 18th-century iron. The phone rang, with orders for banana pancakes. A stack of menus listed coffee-shop standbys, including “Diet Delights”: a breadless burger with cottage cheese, or tuna over lettuce (Individual Can). The owners, Mr. Gouvakis, his brother, John, and their brother-in-law Timmy Vlachos, did not observe any special ritual. But their regulars had other ideas. They came to pay homage. Image Mr. Gouvakis on closing night on Lexington Avenue. Credit Brian Harkin for The New York Times Mr. Gouvakis was struggling to think of an old-school coffee shop still clinging to Lexington Avenue between 72nd and 96th Streets when a gangly teenager bellied up to the register. “Hi, Shorty,” Mr. Gouvakis said. “Shorty? I’m taller than you,” said the customer, Mark Hollman, 15. He added simply, “I heard.” His sister Lauren, 17, had found out that morning, when she stopped by to offer condolences to the grill cooks, who are Mexican, at their World Cup loss. A bit later, the siblings’ parents, Stella and Juan, walked in for a last round of their usuals: a cheeseburger deluxe (his) and a gyro (hers). The Hollmans live on East 73rd and Madison, above an Italian cashmere boutique that was the original Soup Burg until 2006, when the rent increased to $65,000 from $21,000 a month. Mr. Gouvakis lived in the building for years, to the chagrin of his father, who complained that he was arriving to work later than when he lived at home in Jackson Heights, Queens. At any rate, when the Hollmans pulled up in a taxi with their newborns, fresh from the hospital, Mr. Gouvakis was standing there. He had even helped carry the infant Mark upstairs. “They’re his babies,” Mrs. Hollman said. The elegiac visits continued. Mr. Gouvakis stuffed business cards and phone numbers into a blue “We Are Happy to Serve You” coffee cup, promising to alert patrons when, or if, he finds a new location. Walking up First Avenue from East 50th Street — forget Second — he had found 12 empty storefronts, but no landlords who wanted a coffee shop for a tenant. When he saw Nikki Henkin outside, he excused himself. It was time to bring her dog, Tigger, his daily snack. “Tigger doesn’t know it’s the last time,” said Ms. Henkin, who lives upstairs. Tigger, 13, gazed worshipfully up at Mr. Gouvakis, who dangled a slice of ham. “It used to be bacon, but then the vet put him on a diet,” Ms. Henkin explained. She mentioned that her hairdresser on the next block had been priced out, too. “Gus?” Mr. Gouvakis said. “He’s gone?” “Went somewhere on Second Avenue,” Ms. Henkin said vaguely, waving a hand eastward. “I really need a haircut.” Image Mr. Gouvakis at the cash register. Credit Brian Harkin for The New York Times It is fair to ask if changing gustatory tastes played a role. New Yorkers will not always claim their local coffee shop’s food is great, but the Soup Burg stood out in at least one respect. In 2004, Time Out New York rated its burger third citywide, behind that of the famed Donovan’s Pub and P. J. Clarke’s but ahead of the serious contenders J. G. Melon and Pastis. If Edward Hopper’s “Nighthawks” patrons ate burgers, the magazine said, the burgers would “probably taste like this.” “There’s no secret,” Mr. Gouvakis said. “I use my father’s ratio, 75 percent meat, 25 percent fat.” No pre-made patties, he added, “and the grill has to be hot.” The original Soup Burg, which opened in 1948, was a dark hole-in-the-wall thick with burger smoke. Sometime in the 1970s, I sat on a stool at its L-shape counter, feeling very grown up, on one of my first lunch dates alone with my mother. Not much later, Mr. Gouvakis quit school and came to work for his father, Peter, an immigrant from Chios, Greece, who had taken a job there in 1958 and bought Soup Burg in 1964. At the peak of the empire, in 2005, the neighborhood had three. In my childhood of plentiful coffee shops, the Soup Burg, three blocks away, was a bit far. For family breakfasts, we walked the block to the Skyline, where an elderly neighbor could often be found eating a grape jelly omelet. Cabdrivers idled outside for the 24-hour service; later, in our 20s, my friends and I nursed hangovers there. The Skyline closed a decade ago, replaced by a succession of forgettable yuppie eateries. Longer gone are Bonté Patisserie, where Madame Bonté slipped extra cookies to small customers; most of the Czech, Hungarian and German restaurants of old Yorkville; pretty much any hardware shop west of First; and Henry Hudela’s clock repair. Whenever my mother pushed her temperamental mantel clock to his shop in a baby carriage, Mr. Hudela, if begged, would set off all his cuckoos at once. However, if you are looking for a Duane Reade, a bank or a $400 cocktail dress, you are in luck. And my children? I guess they have Shake Shack. As for Mr. Gouvakis, he tries not to take it personally. It is not his father’s era, when landlords negotiated $500 rent hikes over burgers. Single and healthy, he considers himself a rich man, worried only about his partners’ three children. But he admitted on that final Sunday that one thing made him anxious. “Tomorrow when I wake up,” he said, “it’ll be the first day in my life that I don’t have a job.”",

    "source": "‘Meet the Press’ Changes, and Hopes Its Rank Won’t <eos> NBC News used the occasion of an appearance by President-elect Barack Obama on “Meet the Press” on Sunday to make official its appointment of David Gregory as the next permanent moderator of that venerable political discussion program. The news of Mr. Gregory’s selection had leaked out in reports last week. On Sunday, Tom Brokaw, who became interim host in June after the sudden death of Tim Russert, said that he would step down. Mr. Gregory’s first program will be next week. Mr. Russert had lifted “Meet the Press” to a long period of dominance among the Sunday morning shows, establishing himself in the process as perhaps the most formidable interviewer on television. In a telephone interview, Mr. Gregory, who is 38, acknowledged that the task before him was challenging. “I’m honored,” he said. “I feel humbled and very excited. I’m not nervous or apprehensive about it, but it is daunting.” The change comes as the Washington power-broker lineup is about to be recast with the arrival of the Obama administration. Calling this “a critically important time for the country,” Mr. Brokaw said on Sunday’s program that “more people are paying attention” to the weekly network Sunday programs than at any time since 1968. That combination of factors has NBC’s competitors anticipating an opportunity to alter the dynamics of Sunday morning talk. George Stephanopoulos, the face of ABC’s program “This Week,” said he saw genuine opportunity in the changeover, though he said, “There’s no question that ‘Meet the Press’ is a powerful brand.” It is the oldest program on television, and like other programs started by NBC in the medium’s early days — “Today” and “The Tonight Show” — “Meet the Press” is a television institution. Still, it is hardly invulnerable. In the 1980s, ABC’s “This Week” dominated for a decade. Mr. Russert reversed that, first by persuading NBC to expand “Meet the Press” to an hour to match “This Week,” then by ratcheting up the intensity of the interviews. But now NBC’s competitors see an opening. “I think the post-Russert era begins now,” said Chris Wallace, the host of “Fox News Sunday.” This year, NBC has averaged about 4.5 million viewers on its Sunday morning show, “This Week” about 3.4 million, and CBS’s “Face the Nation,” hosted by Bob Schieffer, about 3.1 million. “Fox News Sunday” on the Fox network has about 1.6 million viewers, but that number jumps to about 3 million when the program is repeated in the evening on the Fox News Channel. The other cable entrant in the competition, CNN, is also about to make a change, with John King set to take over its “Late Edition” Sunday morning program soon from its host, Wolf Blitzer. Maintaining the dominant position Mr. Russert established is clearly an important consideration. Steve Capus, the president of NBC News, said that he was most interested in the program sustaining a reputation for “tough but fair” interviews. Mr. Gregory said that he felt “the great sense of purpose in the program.” Under his new contract, he will continue to have a presence on “Today,” serving as the regular substitute host for Matt Lauer. But he will give up his interview program on NBC’s all-news cable channel, MSNBC. NBC also extended the contract of Betsy Fischer, the executive producer of “Meet the Press,” who attended American University in Washington at the same time as Mr. Gregory. None of the programs have ambitious plans to shake up the format. Ms. Fischer said any changes under Mr. Gregory would be “gradual and seamless.” There isn’t much you can do differently with a program based on a face-to-face interview. The competition is generally not over how the programs are put together but who the guests are. Some competitors suggest that Mr. Stephanopoulos may have an advantage because he worked in a Democratic administration populated by many names that are making a comeback. “George obviously does have close relationships with people from the Clinton White House,” Mr. Wallace said. Mr. Stephanopoulos said, “I’m going to draw on every relationship I have.” Mr. Schieffer, host of “Face the Nation,” recalled that Mr. Russert considered himself “the curator of a national treasure” and added that he had always been impressed with Mr. Gregory’s talents. “Tim is irreplaceable,” Mr. Schieffer said, “but somebody has to do it.” Mr. Gregory, the new curator, will be under considerable pressure — and scrutiny. Mr. Stephanopoulos pointed out that “Brokaw is handing David about a one-million-viewer lead.” Mr. Schieffer said, “It’s going to be tough competition. I wish David the best — and I’m going to try to beat his brains out.”",

    "source": "Kremlin Statements Move Farther Away From Assad <eos> MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin said Friday that Russia ’s main goal in the Syrian conflict was to avoid chaos, the latest in a series of remarks that have served to distance Moscow from the government of President Bashar al-Assad and shift the focus to a controlled political transition. “We will do what we can so that there will be order in Syria , so that it will be a democratic regime based on the will of the Syrian people,” he said at a news conference after the European Union-Russia summit meeting in Brussels. “Whatever changes are occurring in Syria, we would not like to see the same chaos there which we are seeing in other countries in the region.” His comments expanded on those he made on Thursday, at a televised year-end news conference in Moscow. Speaking in response to a question about Russia’s position toward Syria, Mr. Putin said Russian leaders “are not preoccupied by the fate of Assad’s regime.” “We understand what is going on there and that the family has held power for 40 years,” he said. “Undoubtedly, there is a call for change.” Russia has been the most important foreign supporter of Mr. Assad’s government in the conflict, which began as an uprising against him nearly two years ago and grew into an armed rebellion that has left the Syrian leader’s grip on power increasingly in doubt. While Russian leaders have acknowledged rebel gains in Syria, they still adamantly resist taking part in any international effort aimed at pressuring Mr. Assad to resign. Russia’s foreign minister said in an interview with Russia Today, a government news organization, that Moscow was still rejecting appeals from other countries to help persuade the Syrian leader to flee. “We are not in the business of regime change,” Mr. Lavrov told Russia Today in the interview, which was broadcast on Friday. “Some of the regional players were suggesting, ‘Why don’t you tell President Assad to leave — we will arrange some safe haven for him.’ My answer is very simple. If indeed those people have this in mind, why not bring it to President Assad? Why use us as a postman? If President Assad is interested, this must be discussed directly with him.”",

    "source": "Consumer Debt Suggests Growing Confidence <eos> CONSUMERS appear to be growing more confident and are less likely to be behind on their bills, according to figures released this week by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Using figures from Equifax, one of the major credit reporting companies, the New York Fed estimated that consumers owed $8.69 trillion in mortgage debt at the end of the first quarter, 2 percent more than they owed a year earlier. That figure includes both first mortgages and home equity loans. It was the first year-over-year increase since 2008. That amount remains 13 percent below the $9.99 trillion peak that Equifax estimated consumers owed at the end of the third quarter of 2008. As many Americans defaulted on mortgages and lost their homes during the financial crisis, the amount of outstanding mortgage debt declined. There was also a sharp decline in new mortgages as fewer homes were sold. The New York Fed report also indicated that the proportion of all four major categories of consumer debt that was seriously delinquent — behind by at least 90 days in payment — declined during the quarter. Only 8.5 percent of credit card loans were in that category at the end of the first quarter, a figure that was lower than at any point previously recorded in the data, which goes back to 2003. The serious delinquency rate on student loans fell to 11 percent from 11.5 percent, but remained higher than the rate for any other category. Despite the small increase in overall mortgages outstanding, the New York Fed reported that young adults “continued to retreat from the housing market,” as three Fed researchers, Meta Brown, Sydnee Caldwell and Sarah Sutherland, put it in a blog post as the report was released. The data indicated that in 2013, the proportion of adults age 27 to 30 with home mortgage debt continued to decline, falling to 21.6 percent among those with student loans outstanding, and 22.3 percent of those with no such loans. Before 2012, young adults with student loans were more likely to have purchased homes than were those without such debt. That was taken as an indication that such people were more likely to be college graduates, with better-paying jobs. The change, the Fed researchers said, may reflect that people with student loans are now more burdened by them. And, they added, it may reflect that 30-year-olds with student loans on average have lower credit scores than those without such loans, and thus have a harder time getting mortgages to buy homes. Another indication of improving confidence is that younger people now seem more willing to take on debt to buy cars. As can be seen in the accompanying charts, the proportion of people 22 to 25 years of age with auto loans rose in 2013 for the first time since the recession began. That was true for both those with student loans and those without. As can be seen from the charts, the recession caused substantial declines in the amount outstanding of three of the four major categories of consumer debt — mortgages, credit cards and auto loans. Auto loan volume was the first to begin growing again. Credit card debts outstanding appear to have leveled out but have yet to rise significantly. By contrast, the amount of student loans outstanding never fell during the recession, although the rate of growth did slow in 2011 and 2012 before accelerating in 2013. In 2012, student loans replaced credit card debt as the category with the highest proportion of delinquent accounts.",

    "source": "Oudin a Fan Favorite in Native Georgia, Before Winning Hearts at Open <eos> NORCROSS, Ga. — On sun-soaked tennis courts Tuesday afternoon, tweens and young teens thwacked balls as their coaches sporadically name-dropped to emphasize an instructional point. Melanie, they would say, as in Oudin — no surname necessary. Melanie Oudin, the 17-year-old who has taken United States Open hearts hostage, is one of them, a student of her coach Brian de Villiers’s tennis institute at the Racquet Club of the South, and any lesson that references her is most likely absorbed. Even after her first big brush with fame, advancing to the fourth round at Wimbledon this summer, Oudin eagerly stood before them to demonstrate a technique for de Villiers. The audience, some of them restless, became laser-focused, observers say. When a water leak flooded the courts, Oudin fetched a squeegee and mopped up alongside the rank and file. She is known to pick up litter on the grounds. “She’s a prodigy, but not a prima donna,” said John Hoback, a middle-age club member whom she addresses as Mr. Hoback. Though Oudin made her career choice at age 9, she has maintained some normalcy in a profession that can oppress players with a sense of entitlement. Eschewing the live-in tennis academies that draw racket-wielding whiz kids, she stayed at home in Marietta. She would occasionally defer practice, with de Villiers’s consent, to shop or watch movies with friends. Oudin did opt for home-schooling — her idea, not her parents’ — but that has become the norm for top-shelf Generation Z players who require four hours minimum of training daily and crisscross the nation to tournaments. One of Oudin’s weapons is an even-keeled nature that has impressed coaches for years. “If she’d miss a shot, she’d move on,” said Richard Ashby, a national coach with the United States Tennis Association, who has watched her for four years. “If you hadn’t seen the shot, you’d look at her and wouldn’t know she’s made a mistake.” The trait has served Oudin well at the Open, where she tends to spot her foe a set before fighting back. “I don’t teach her competitiveness,” de Villiers said. “That’s what comes from within her, and that’s what’s pulling her through.” Yet, he does not coddle her. They may delay practice until evening, but it is not cut short or ever made easy. “I think when you go through the pain barrier a couple times in training, and you feel like you’ve earned something, then you’re less likely to want to throw it away,” de Villiers said. De Villiers credits her parents, Leslie and John, with a hands-off approach, allowing him to call the shots, in more ways than one. “I think that’s why it’s worked,” he said. “The parents have been great in that they’ve given her the opportunity to pursue it and have supported her, and they haven’t fussed with me.” Oudin’s family tree is flecked with tennis. Frank Willett, a great uncle known as Buckshot, was a national boys indoor champion in the 1930s and a ’61 inductee to the Athletics Hall of Fame at Georgia Tech, his alma mater. “He was good at every phase of the game,” Dan Magill, a retired coach and Georgia tennis historian, said of Willett. “Very talented.” Joan Robertson of Marietta, Melanie’s grandmother, is a lifelong player who still rallies at age 77. It was Robertson who introduced Oudin, then 9, to de Villiers, who promptly became her tennis mentor. One feature her ancestors could not pass down was height. Oudin is 5 feet 6 inches, a munchkin among the sport’s towering figures. “I’m praying for another inch,” de Villiers said, “but I don’t think I’m going to get it.” To her fellow club members, young and old, many of whom who will gather again Wednesday night in the club restaurant to cheer long distance when she plays Caroline Wozniacki in the quarterfinals, Oudin stands tall. Even when she is bent over a squeegee or a piece of trash.",

    "source": "Zuma Has Yet to Fulfill Promises to South Africans <eos> SIYATHEMBA, South Africa — President Jacob Zuma , the son of a widowed maid, tried to reason with the rowdy crowd in this restive township. He had come to fix their broken public services, he assured them, but their angry heckling kept drowning him out. Finally, like a glowering patriarch, he lectured and scolded them, threatening to leave. “This means you will live forever in poverty!” he exclaimed. “If we do not listen to each other, how can we fix anything?” Suddenly, the rage of the throng dissipated. There was a chorus of apologies. A voice shouted, “Sorry, Baba!” Then a cry arose for the president to sing his trademark song from the anti-apartheid struggle, “Bring Me My Machine Gun.” “You want it?” he asked. “Yes!” they shouted. And like an aging entertainer obliging with a golden oldie, Mr. Zuma, 68, crooned and boogied onstage. It was a moment that encapsulated both the promise and the unfulfilled potential of Mr. Zuma, who has raised the hopes of the dispossessed but not yet delivered the better life they are demanding. Despite persistent corruption charges and the taint of extramarital affairs, he is a political survivor who has risen to lead the continent’s powerhouse nation and will soon step onto the international stage as South Africa holds Africa’s first World Cup. With his rumbling laugh and habit of dancing onstage , Mr. Zuma has a gift for connecting with the country’s impoverished black majority, who are impatient for the better life promised by the dawning of democratic rule 16 years ago. “I’ve never seen a president in Africa in direct dialogue with his citizens like Jacob Zuma,” said Zakhele Maya, 26, an activist in Siyathemba who, like most in the township, is jobless. But that connection has not quelled the discontent. After an earlier visit, last year , Mr. Zuma ordered the government to improve the township’s health and housing services, yet frustrations continued to rise. In February, residents burned down the library. The books are now charred scraps, the library a pile of blackened rubble. A year into his five-year term, Mr. Zuma recently signed performance contracts with his ministers, setting out specific results for them to achieve. But analysts are urging action, not aspirations, on South Africa’s core challenges: a failing education system , staggering levels of joblessness and the widening chasm between rich and poor. There is already open speculation about whether his party, the African National Congress, in power since the end of apartheid, will pick him for a second term. “By 2013, the questions arise: Who will govern beyond 2014?” asked Trevor Manuel, who heads the National Planning Commission in Mr. Zuma’s office and was finance minister for the previous 13 years. “And the intense period has to be 2011, 2012, into 2013. Those are the middle years of the term of government, and I think the foundation is now well laid. Now you’ve got to drive the change.” Mr. Zuma’s highly personal, consensus-building style has helped him lead a sweeping new attack on AIDS after almost a decade of failed leadership under his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki. But even some in his party say that tackling the nation’s deep economic problems will probably require angering allies who put him in office, especially Cosatu — the powerful trade union federation that is part of the governing alliance — and the A.N.C.’s youth wing. It is led by the incendiary Julius Malema , 29, regarded by many here as a demagogue who plays on racial antagonisms and who was recently sent to anger management classes by the party. The dry kindling of resentment is here to be ignited. The ranks of the jobless have grown by more than a million in the past year and a half, and South Africa, population 49 million, already had among the highest rates of chronic unemployment in the world. More than a third of the work force, including those too discouraged to seek work, is jobless. Studies have found that most of the unemployed have never held a job. Mr. Zuma announced in February that proposals would be put forward to subsidize the wages of inexperienced workers, to help them get a foot in the door. But Cosatu, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, which represents those who already have jobs, opposes the idea — and debate within the government continues. Another point of tension is education. Last year, Mr. Zuma said teachers and principals — whose union is also part of Cosatu — must be held accountable for whether they show up and do their jobs. In an interview, Mr. Zuma reiterated the need for such a step and said it would be taken by the end of his second year in office. “There’s no teacher who’s going to hide behind the school,” he said. But critics question whether Mr. Zuma has the support to follow through on these difficult decisions, the vision to address the country’s daunting challenges or the standing to root out corruption. Worries deepened when it surfaced that Mr. Zuma, who already had three wives and a fiancée, had fathered a child, his 20th, out of wedlock with the daughter of a family friend. “The biggest danger we face as a country is the use of office for personal gain, and it is becoming so, so normal, and nobody’s arresting that,” said Mondli Makhanya, a newspaper editor whose reporter broke the story about Mr. Zuma’s child in The Sunday Times. “He lacks the leadership strength at this point to turn against people who supported him, and he lacks the moral authority to say, ‘No, you can’t do that.’ ” More fundamentally, making choices that would divide the governing alliance goes against Mr. Zuma’s instincts as an African traditionalist who seeks to settle conflicts by gathering his coalition under a metaphoric marula tree to talk for days or weeks until they reach a consensus, said Allister Sparks, a veteran commentator here. “Action dies in the process of eternal, everlasting debate,” Mr. Sparks said. Mr. Manuel, the former finance minister, says the president’s style is to keep everyone in the tent, recalling Mr. Zuma’s efforts to mediate Burundi’s complex civil war. “He’d sit in Dar es Salaam for tens of days, and he has the most remarkable patience to do that kind of thing,” Mr. Manuel said. “So perhaps he needs the support of ministers who are going to push and shove and try to get things done.” On issues including teacher accountability, Mr. Manuel said, “Instinctively, I would take a much harder line on some of these things.” Mr. Zuma’s political resilience should not be underestimated. After a decade as a political prisoner, he rose to lead the A.N.C.’s underground intelligence operation during the anti-apartheid struggle. As president, he has filled important police and prosecutorial posts with loyalists, making it unlikely he will face further corruption charges. In an interview, he told a story that suggested the roots of the cool calculation beneath his warm, amiable style. “If you are angry, you can’t think properly, and the other boys will really beat you up,” he said of his days learning stick fighting with other Zulu boys. “You’ve got to be sober so that you can be able to defend yourself and also hit the other boy.” As the debate over Mr. Zuma swirls, the man himself has fun on the hustings. He recently basked in the adulation of a vast crowd at a township stadium in the Free State for a World Cup prayer service sponsored by the A.N.C. The event was an ecstatic, incantatory fusion of sports, religion and politics that would not have seemed out of place in Texas. Thousands of churchwomen ululated for him and the South African soccer team, Bafana Bafana. “Long live Jacob Zuma!” one cried. “Long live!” the crowd responded. A small smile flickered across Mr. Zuma’s face as the premier of the Free State said: “We are not talking succession. We are just saying the president should be president again and again and again!” White dignitaries mounted the stage. A blanket imprinted with the South African flag was laid on the floor; Mr. Zuma knelt on it as preachers placed their hands on his head. People gathered around and raised their hands to God, a tableau of racial harmony. “Let us receive our visitors warmly with love,” Mr. Zuma said of the coming games. “Let us embrace them.” And with a mischievous glint, he added, “Those who at times are not good, let them for just four weeks be good.”",

    "source": "Mets Closer on Sale Talks With Einhorn, Also May Be Speaking With Others <eos> Even amid assertions that negotiations with David Einhorn were moving toward a positive conclusion next month, the Mets reopened discussions recently with at least one other serious bidder for a minority share of the team, according to two people with knowledge of the talks. The Mets have reached out to Ray Bartoszek, the billionaire former oil trader for Glencore International, and asked him to re-enter the bidding, the two people said. Fred Wilpon , the Mets’ principal owner, met with Bartoszek on Wednesday at Wilpon’s Long Island estate, and the sides had been expected to continue negotiations over the next few days. But later in the day Wilpon and his son Jeff, the chief operating officer of the team, met with Einhorn, said another person with knowledge of those talks, and apparently concluded a new exclusive negotiating agreement with him that is expected to lead to a final deal next month, on better terms for the Mets. Just hours after meeting with Bartoszek, the Mets released a statement at 7:05 p.m. that said they were negotiating only with Einhorn, raising questions about the purpose of the meeting with Bartoszek. “We are in exclusive negotiations with David Einhorn and continue to have positive and productive discussions regarding David’s ongoing interest in an investment in the Mets,” the statement said. Other parties who were involved in the original bidding were also contacted and invited to renew their efforts after the Mets and Einhorn failed to reach a final agreement within the initial exclusivity period that ended last month. Based on the sequence of events, it is not inconceivable that the Mets could have used the negotiations with Bartoszek, and others, to compel more favorable terms from Einhorn. That certainly appears to be reflected in an agreement on a new period of exclusivity. Bartoszek, a former college infielder who grew up a devout Mets fan, was involved in the original bidding process and was said to have come in second to Einhorn. The Mets chose Einhorn in an unusual deal that would provide them with much-needed capital — $200 million — at a time when they were facing severe financial distress. That included the specter of a billion-dollar lawsuit filed by Irving H. Picard, the trustee for the victims of Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme . Since then, the Mets’ owners, who were heavy investors with Madoff, won a favorable ruling that shifted the case out of bankruptcy court. That may have emboldened them to seek a deal better than the one initially reached with Einhorn in May. Although the framework of the original deal has not been made public, most agree that it provided Einhorn with a clear path to majority ownership if the Mets could not repay him the $200 million within a time frame said to be between three and five years. The number of years depends on the outcome of the Madoff litigation and would be negotiated once the result of the lawsuit is determined. Commissioner Bud Selig has spoken favorably about Einhorn, whom he has known since Einhorn was a child in Milwaukee and played baseball on the lawn of one of Selig’s neighbors. Selig is thought to favor Einhorn’s candidacy, especially because he could end up controlling the Mets within a few years. But at a recent news media conference at Sun Valley, Idaho, Wilpon told people that he was not happy with the deal he cut with Einhorn and was willing to accept new bids. Regardless of the Madoff lawsuit, the Mets still need an infusion of cash to pay off their loans and meet payroll demands.",

    "source": "Protest Over Schools’ Military Recruiting Policy <eos> A new Department of Education policy that gives military recruiters centralized access to high school student data is drawing fire from the New York Civil Liberties Union , as well as some parents and students. In the past, military recruiters were required to go from school to school to obtain student names, addresses and telephone numbers, sometimes encountering resistance from school employees and students. Now, under an order signed last month by Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein, recruiters can access data from each high school simply by going to the Department of Education’s headquarters. At a news conference on Wednesday afternoon, the civil liberties group criticized the change in policy, saying it opened the door to aggressive concentration on certain students. “The D.O.E. is giving military recruiters a direct line to New York City’s children,” said Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the civil liberties group. In a letter to Ms. Lieberman on Wednesday, the Department of Education said it had revised the recruiting procedures to add another layer of oversight. Under the new system, the letter said, department officials can scrutinize the number of students choosing to opt out and check to make sure no school has failed to distribute opt-out forms. Centralizing the data also prevents military recruiters from holding impromptu recruitment sessions while on campuses to get student data, the letter said, and it reduces the flow of communication between military branches and schools that “often proved disruptive.” Ms. Lieberman called on the city to delay implementing the new policy. She said the Department of Education had shown a “startling disregard for open government” by not asking for public input on the new measure, and she suggested that it solicit feedback for 30 days. Under the federal No Child Left Behind law, schools are required to provide military recruiters the same access to students granted to colleges and prospective employers. Parents are allowed to block access to a child’s data by signing a form. But Ms. Lieberman said the city had not made an adequate effort to inform parents of that choice, even though the Department of Education has been telling principals to send letters to parents and students about the opt-out option. The department’s Web site also includes the form, in eight languages.",

    "source": "Trained in Manhattan, Graduating to the World <eos> TO swim to the top ranks of commercial real estate brokers in New York City, Barry M. Gosin perfected an elegant crawl. But now, as the chief executive of Newmark Knight Frank, he has to maneuver the waters of a much larger pond. Mr. Gosin's company -- formerly known as Newmark & Company, which expanded nationally only about five years ago -- sealed a partnership in January with Knight Frank of London, one of the world's largest privately owned property consulting firms. Last year, the firms handled transactions that, combined, were valued at more than $41 billion, with annual revenue of more than $545 million. Mr. Gosin will oversee the operations in North and South America, while Knight Frank's chairman and senior partner, Nick Thomlinson, will oversee the rest of the offices throughout the world. Besides supervising Newmark's 26 offices in the United States, Mr. Gosin will have under his auspices five existing Knight Frank offices in Brazil and three that will open later this year in Lima, Peru; Santiago, Chile; and Buenos Aires. Mr. Gosin, 55, who grew up in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, seems eager to take on the global arena. \"Someone told me a long time ago, if you don't grow, you die,\" he said. \"Every business has to be dynamic.\" Mr. Gosin and a business partner, Jeffrey Gural, bought Newmark in 1978 from Mr. Gural's father, Aaron Gural, who had taken over the company from Dave Newmark, its founder. At the time, Mr. Gosin was a fledgling real estate entrepreneur who had joined the firm to learn how to buy real estate. And that he did. Mr. Gosin and several Newmark principals have an eight-million-square-foot commercial real estate portfolio that includes the landmark Flatiron Building in Manhattan. \"Aaron Gural came out of the Helmsley-Spear school of real estate,\" Mr. Gosin said, referring to the real estate company. \"He taught us how to buy property, and it was a great platform for us.\" Newmark also expanded into development, forming a construction division several years ago that specialized in converting office buildings into apartments. Until recently, Mr. Gosin and his partners, along with the developer David Walentas, owned about 10 buildings in the Dumbo area of Brooklyn, and worked to transform Dumbo from an obscure industrial area into a trendy residential neighborhood. Mr. Gosin, a history buff, is enthusiastic about a purchase in 2004: for about $4 million his company acquired the former headquarters of Bethlehem Steel in Bethlehem, Pa., and the surrounding 125 acres. The deal includes the headquarters building, designed by Sanford White, and three million square feet of structures. Mr. Gosin and his partners envision a development worth more than $400 million that is to include a casino with 5,000 slot machines -- state license permitting -- a hotel, theater, retail stores, residential buildings and a museum commemorating the country's industrial history. \"The steel for most of the large buildings in New York City was forged here,\" he said. \"This is where the 20th century was built.\" But the allure of ownership aside, Mr. Gosin's first love is brokering deals. As he points out, Harry Helmsley, the legendary New York City real estate magnate, also worked as a broker until the day he died in 1997. \"It's an exciting business, and a great way of being a part of what happens in the city,\" said Mr. Gosin, who began cultivating Newmark's brokerage and advisory division when he sensed a lull in the city's real estate market in the late 80's. \"I saw a disconnect between the fundamentals and the values, so the underlying demand was not there,\" Mr. Gosin said. \"The prices were continuing to go up in the late 80's. Rents didn't go up. It just didn't appear to be right, so we needed to find an alternative to keep us busy.\" During Mr. Gosin's tenure, Newmark's brokerage business has flourished. \"We have a unique perspective on the advisory business in that we're one of the few brokerage firms that has a significant investment portfolio,\" Mr. Gosin said. \"And we think that the fact that we own property and the fact that we run property gives us a unique vantage point from which to represent companies who rent space and properties.\" Mr. Gosin represents mostly big tenants and has handled some of New York City's largest and most intricate leasing deals, including the consolidation of the new Manhattan headquarters of Bloomberg L.P. at 731 Lexington Avenue, between 58th and 59th Streets, in the One Beacon Court building. (Construction on the Bloomberg Tower was completed last year.) Mr. Gosin said his team first had to sell the move to Michael R. Bloomberg, the company founder, who was not yet mayor of New York. \"My first conversation with Mike went like, 'You're on so many floors, you're in so many buildings, it would be a good opportunity for you when your lease expires to consolidate,' \" Mr. Gosin said. \"And Mike is fairly glib. He said, 'If you can prove that it makes economic sense, go talk to my head of real estate, and we'll do it.' \" \"The exchange probably lasted 15 minutes, because that's about as long as, I guess, Mike would give somebody for the first time,\" he said. Mr. Gosin said Newmark then had to persuade the principals at Vornado Realty Trust, the developer, to let Bloomberg lease a portion of One Beacon Court tower, which had not yet been built. It had been largely slated for residential use. \"We went to Steve Roth and suggested that we be the anchor tenant in the base of the building,\" Mr. Gosin said, referring to the chief executive of Vornado. \"At the time, they had a preference for more residential, and had they known the market would have shot up the way it did, they probably would have done even more residential.\" Still, the Newmark team pulled off the deal, leasing 700,000 square feet in a building that didn't yet exist, and ensuring that its client, as an anchor tenant, would be able to design the building according to its needs. \"We spent 18 months torturously negotiating a lease for Bloomberg so they'd build a new building\" for the company, Mr. Gosin said. \"The building, which is beautiful, is designed with Bloomberg specs.\" Mr. Gosin said jokingly that he should have been paid by the hour on that transaction. But Jeffrey Gural, the chairman of Newmark Knight Frank, said, \"As a broker, Barry's real strength is he really and truly tries to do a good job for his client -- even if it means not making a commission.\" Mark Weiss, an executive vice president at Newmark who joined from a competing brokerage firm, Studley, almost four years ago, described Mr. Gosin as a caring boss. Shortly after arriving at Newmark, Mr. Weiss said, he discovered that his wife had breast cancer. Mr. Gosin \"walked into my office, put his arm around me -- and I didn't really know this guy, it was a new relationship -- said, 'Anything you need, we're here for you,' \" Mr. Weiss said. \"He had promised a pretty big bill of goods, and he has delivered on all fronts.\" BUT does Mr. Gosin also have that toughness to lead a company on a large and impersonal global front, against giant competitors like CB Richard Ellis, Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle? Perhaps a clue lies in his tennis game. When osteoarthritis was diagnosed in his left shoulder several years ago, Mr. Gosin, a southpaw, learned to serve \"righty\" and continued todominate his competitors. Mr. Gosin will need to be just as adaptable to succeed in the global commercial real estate market. \"Barry's as good as they come,\" said Robert J. Alexander, chairman of the New York regional practice at CB Richard Ellis. \"But I think his company's got a lot of challenges ahead, and the results will speak for themselves over the next few years. Clearly, this is no slam-dunk.\"",

    "source": "Unflattering Portrait of Virginia’s Former First Lady Is Offered by Her Lawyers <eos> RICHMOND, Va. — Lawyers defending Maureen McDonnell at her and her husband’s corruption trial presented a portrait of the former first lady of Virginia that was embarrassing and at times even humiliating. Ms. McDonnell, whose defense began and rested on Wednesday, was described as hiding purchases from her husband, former Gov. Bob McDonnell, when the family was financially stressed early in his career; exploding in anger at her husband while he sought in vain to mollify her; and, ultimately, turning to a wealthy nutritional supplement executive to fill an emotional void in her life. The oldest of the McDonnells’ five children, Jeanine McDonnell Zubowsky, testified that her father once confided about his troubled marriage: “I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t make her happy. She’s always angry.” The unusual defense presented by Mr. McDonnell’s lawyers from opening arguments has been criticized by some observers as callous. But, legal experts say, it is more likely a tactic that both defense teams have agreed on to rebut the government’s case. As presented throughout the trial, exposing Ms. McDonnell’s weaknesses seemed intended to win sympathy for her with the jury. Equally, it bolsters defense lawyers’ claims that the couple were so estranged they could not have worked together to trade the governor’s office for $177,000 in loans and luxury gifts from the business executive, Jonnie R. Williams Sr. Showing Ms. McDonnell to be infatuated with Mr. Williams also helps the defense counter the government’s case of a strict business deal between Mr. Williams and the McDonnells. “I think she had a mild obsession with Jonnie,” Ms. Zubowsky testified. “I’ve never heard her talk about anyone in this manner.” Mr. Williams has testified that he wanted the governor’s office to promote a nutritional supplement that he believed to be a kind of miracle cure, and that his relationship with the McDonnells was all business, not a friendship. Ms. Zubowsky, who last year married a former aide to her father, described following his footsteps to Notre Dame and into the Army out of admiration for him. She deployed to Iraq as a signal officer. She recalled growing up in Virginia Beach with her mother working as a waitress to support the family while her father attended law school, and then the financial stresses as he began a career as a prosecutor and member of the state’s House of Delegates. “My mom would go shopping while my dad was working,” Ms. Zubowsky said. “There would be arguments later that so much money was spent.” While her mother frequently raised her voice, she said, her father never did. “He was trying to not have it escalate,” she said. “He was trying to end the conversation as quickly as possible.” Even back then, she recalled, her parents seemed to communicate little. “It was never more than just the logistics about children,” she said. Once her father became governor in 2010, her parents projected intimacy in public, but it was a sham, their daughter testified. “It was like a switch, they could turn it on,” she said of public hand-holding. Another defense witness, April Niamtu, a friend of the former first lady, described Ms. McDonnell as frequently out of her depth in her role. Ms. Niamtu helped Ms. McDonnell put together her wardrobe for the inauguration ceremonies. “She was so nervous she wasn’t going to look the part,” Ms. Niamtu testified. When Mr. Williams offered to fly Ms. McDonnell on his jet to a convention in Utah for NuSkin, a nutritional supplement that Ms. McDonnell had long sold, the first lady asked Ms. Niamtu to go along. “She was exhausted,” Ms. Niamtu recalled. “She said: ‘I just need my girlfriend time. Will you please go with me?’ ” Ms. Niamtu, who called Ms. McDonnell “very gullible,” said she had formed an impression of Mr. Williams on the flight as a slick salesman. “He pulled out his little Tic Tac bottle and started passing it around,” she said of his eagerness to share his supplement pills, known as Anatabloc. Mr. Williams, she said, told how the product, an anti-inflammatory derived from tobacco, saved his wife from thyroid surgery, and he said that a cream he had made from the active ingredient reduced a swelling on his head in minutes. The defense also called an investigator working for Mr. McDonnell’s lawyers, a former F.B.I. agent, to testify about the details of a flood of phone and text messages between Ms. McDonnell and Mr. Williams. The investigator, Robert Ross, exposed a possible contradiction in Mr. Williams’s earlier testimony, when he said he had called Ms. McDonnell from a jewelry store in California to ask her what she wanted engraved on a Rolex she had asked him to buy for her husband. There was apparently no record of a call between the two on the date, Aug. 14, 2011. With Ms. McDonnell’s defense resting, Judge James R. Spencer told the jury that closing arguments were likely to begin Friday. With the jury out of the room, the judge asked Ms. McDonnell to rise. He asked her whether she had been informed that she had a right to testify, and he sought assurance that she voluntarily waived that right. “Yes, your honor,” Ms. McDonnell replied softly, the only time her voice has been heard at trial.",

    "source": "U.S. Open: Roddick Happily Accepts a Home-Court Edge <eos> Late in the match, Andy Roddick heard a team-sport cheer, the kind the Yankees hear from their Bleacher Creatures, the kind the Rangers hear from the upper rows of the Garden. “An-dy Rod-dick!” followed by a staccato clap-clap-clap. As soon as he had disposed of Julien Benneteau in straight sets, Roddick acknowledged the support in his on-court interview. “Man, I had a blast, I really did,” he told the crowd. “You come out here and hear people cheering for you. Thank you. You made it fun for me.” Roddick was not showboating, not playing to the public. The crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium sensed that Roddick was raising his game, in his third match of the United States Open , so the crowd raised its game, too. If this is a home-court advantage, if this is why CBS and the Open officials make sure Roddick plays in tennis prime time on the major court of the American championship, so be it. Whether or not there is much of a home-court advantage, the United States has four male players through to the Round of 16 for the first time since, get this, 2003. For much of that time, as Andre Agassi wore down and nobody quite replaced him, Roddick has had to apologize for his one Open championship in 2003, when he was 21 , and it was a very good year. It was such a good year for American tennis that Agassi, Taylor Dent and Todd Martin reached the Round of 16 in 2003, along with Roddick, who won it all. Since then, the United States has produced two, three, two, two, three, one and two players in the Round of 16. Once again, there are four: Roddick, Donald Young, Mardy Fish and John Isner. Been down so long, four seems like up to the United States Tennis Association. “It’s a great thing to see,” Roddick said in his postmatch news conference. “You just feel there’s a little bit of momentum. There is a bit of a snowball effect at times if it goes the right way. Seems like there’s some of that right now.” Roddick said he detected “a healthy jealousy going on right now,” in which Young might notice Ryan Harrison having a good summer and step up his own game. And there was Roddick, blasting serves and even moving friskily around the court in his 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (5) victory over Benneteau, of France. Roddick’s next opponent, David Ferrer of Spain, beat him in a Davis Cup match in July in Austin, Tex., Roddick’s home turf. The other day, Roddick noted that every match of his since 2002 has been played in Ashe Stadium. The U.S.T.A verified that his Ashe streak began with the quarterfinals of the 2002 Open and included 37 straight matches as of Sunday. His overall record at Ashe is 35-9 after Sunday’s victory. (The U.S.T.A. gave him an extra victory in its Open media guide but discovered it had counted one midnight match twice.) Roddick has played the third-most matches there, 44, of any male player, behind Roger Federer, the leader in victories (47) and matches (51). Agassi, now retired, is second among the men with 49 matches and 41 victories. The reason all three have played so much in the main stadium is that they are great players, and extremely popular. Which makes sense. Roddick works hard at maintaining a grumpy facade, but he would not hold back his delight with the crowd Sunday. “I think this year, more than any, I’ve looked around a couple times in the stadium and just realized how cool it really is, how special it is,” he said. “Yeah, afterwards, I was happy. I mean, I went from four weeks ago I wasn’t even playing tennis to now I’m in the second week of a major again. So it turns quickly sometimes. I was humbled at the end. I was happy. I was happy.” Seeded 21st in this tournament, Roddick was given star billing by the network and the Open, as opposed to the defending champion, Rafael Nadal, who is seeded second and was told to play at 11 a.m. Sunday. Asked in the prematch courtside interview how he felt as the opening act, Nadal characteristically said a player had to do what he had to do, or words to that effect. Besides, what was he going to do, stage a protest? There was one protest, back in 1987, when rain loomed for the long tripleheader of the second Saturday, and the Open officials moved up the start of the first men’s semifinal to 10 a.m. from 11 a.m. This rankled the two players, Stefan Edberg and Mats Wilander, so much that they staged a protest, Swedish-style, and did not take the court until the strident hour of 10:15 a.m. (For the record, Wilander won that match and Ivan Lendl beat him on Sunday.) One could only imagine what Jimbo and Junior would have done if their match had been moved up to 10 a.m. The point, though, was that their match would not have been stuck at 10 a.m. Everybody knows the pecking order. But the main thing is to advance at the Open. This time, Roddick has plenty of company.",

    "source": "Brazilian Companies Are Finding Willing Investors Again <eos> SÃO PAULO, Brazil — Six months ago, stocks and bonds in Brazilian companies were practically left for dead. Brazil was sinking deeper into a recession. Its currency, the real, was reeling. And the country’s largest company, the government-controlled energy giant Petrobras , was embroiled in a corruption scandal that drew in politicians and weakened the government of President Dilma Rousseff . Things have changed in six months. Although Brazil is still recovering from its economic malaise, the nation’s major companies are attracting investors again. In recent months, President Rousseff has taken steps to cut the budget deficit. And in an unlikely twist, Petrobras itself is emblematic of the turnaround after it sold $2.5 billion in bonds with a 100-year maturity. Brazil, the world’s seventh-largest economy, still faces hurdles. Investors have lost billions in Brazilian companies that are under investigation in possible securities law violations. The real has dropped nearly 40 percent against the dollar in the last year, adding to losses for foreign investors. Inflation is still more than 8 percent. And should the government’s current progress in stabilizing the national debt falter, fears of a ratings downgrade could again send the currency plunging. But, cautiously, some companies are tapping the public markets. Once new management took over in February, Petrobras — the world’s most indebted energy company, with about $130 billion in debt — moved quickly to build cash reserves. In the last two months, it raised more than $11 billion from the China Development Bank, the Standard Chartered Bank and three Brazilian banks. Petrobras also finally restated its third- and fourth-quarter balance sheets. Those updated books allowed the company to again tap the global bond markets, which it did with the offering Monday. In a reflection of its weakened financial position, Petrobras paid a high price: a yield of 8.45 percent. But the offering was successful, even though analysts had modest expectations. The strong demand for Petrobras’s so-called century bond may confirm that investors are willing to lend to and invest in Brazilian companies. In early May, the Brazilian subsidiary of the Spanish telecom giant Telefónica issued new shares and raised $1.4 billion to help finance its acquisition of Vivendi’s Brazilian telecom unit . In other signs of a turnaround, a local insurance brokerage firm, Par Corretora, held an initial public offering on Tuesday, the first Brazilian company to do so in almost eight months. It raised a modest $190 million, but that exceeded the high end of its target range, as a surge in demand led it to raise its share price. “The success of recent offerings shows that there is a demand for quality names,” said Jean-Marc Etlin, chief executive of the Brazilian investment bank Itaú BBA. More transactions are considered likely soon. The reinsurance company IRB-Brasil is expected to file for an initial public offering, seeking to raise $1.3 billion. Another large bank, Caixa Econômica Federal, said in April that it was looking to hire investment banks to spin off its insurance division this year in an I.P.O. that could raise $3 billion. The government of Brazil has an interest in helping to elevate the capital markets. IRB and Caixa Econômica Federal’s insurance division are partly owned by the government, which is eager to raise new money to close a gaping budget deficit. Brazil’s deficit is 7.5 percent of its gross domestic product. The deficit of crisis-ridden Greece was 3.5 percent of G.D.P. last year. “The government, given its need for money, will probably be aggressive about opening capital in the companies it owns,” said Eliana Chimenti, senior partner for capital markets at the São Paulo law firm Machado Meyer. Stock offerings by privately run companies will probably still take time, because most are waiting to see more improvements in the economy and stock prices. Murilo Ferreira, chief executive of the mining company Vale, said in April that the firm was “working to have everything ready” to sell a stake in its $30 billion base metals division through a listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange. But, he said, a decision had not yet been made. But local bankers still say several deals that were filed, then pulled, might return. For instance, Azul Brazilian Airlines, controlled by the JetBlue founder David Neeleman, is expected to again file for an I.P.O., after it withdrew such plans three times. Petrobras, too, is not done fund-raising. It announced in March that it intended to raise $13.7 billion through asset sales. Some $4 billion is expected to come from selling offshore petroleum reserves. Petrobras’s chief financial officer suggested in April that it might spin off its fuel distribution subsidiary, BR Petrobras Distribuidora. “Uncertainties have lifted enough that investors can see opportunities,” said Renato Ejnisman, head of Banco Bradesco BBI. “There are good names available at good prices.”",

    "source": "A Man Fired for Playing With Kings and Queens Has a Name Fit for Royalty <eos> In the beginning there was Édouard-Etienne de Nevers, sieur de Brantigny, later known as Édouard Boisvert. He immigrated to Quebec from France and in 1654 settled along the St. Lawrence on a prime plot he bought for a cow and two barrels of pickled eel. In the middle was Édouard Antoine Boisvert V, who moved down to Massachusetts and Anglicized the family name to Greenwood. Today, history lives on near Albany, N.Y., where Edward Anthony Greenwood IX, late of the New York City Office of State Legislative Affairs, became nationally famous two days ago as the man who was fired after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg spotted a game of solitaire on his computer screen. To some, Mr. Greenwood has become a symbol of arbitrary injustice, dismissed for doing what millions do every day. Others who are less charitable have called him the living embodiment of the public employee work ethic. But enough about the solitaire incident. What's with that IX? What man who does not rule a large country has a number like that after his name? The executive director of the National Genealogical Society, Diane O'Connor, said she had never run across anyone higher than a V. \"Off the top of my head,\" she said, \"I would say that it is unusual.\" She did not, however, rule it out, and researchers at the University of Montreal said that many French Canadians can trace their roots back a dozen generations, thanks to excellent record-keeping by the early settlers. Edward IX said he had never doubted his bloodline. His half sister, Denise Reneau, who researched the family's history, said she was sure the numerical claim is legitimate. Their father, Edward VIII, said carrying on the family name had been a passion of Edward VII, an uncle who had no children of his own. So assuming that the Edward Greenwood/Boisverts are indeed that rare family that has kept a name alive for centuries, and across an ocean, what have they been up to all these years? And what is it like being a IX? Edward IX said that for most of his life, it has not been a big deal. \"A lot of times people see IX and just put IV because they think it's a V, not an X, or that I wrote it wrong,\" he said. As for the family history, the Greenwood/Boisverts turn out to be your average American family. In 1888, Ms. Reneau said, Edward V's estranged wife had him over for tea and forgot to rinse out the lye she had used to clean the kettle. \"Supposedly she killed him,\" she said. A relative, Chester Greenwood of Maine, invented earmuffs. Edward VI had nine children. Edward VII was a chief petty officer in World War II who, Ms. Reneau said, survived the sinking of an aircraft carrier thanks in part to the fishing skills he inherited from his great-great-great-great grandfather the eeler. Edward VII's brother Arthur was the first chiropractor in Pittsfield, Mass., to have an X-ray machine. \"He loved to stand in front of it to show his patients how you could see your ribs and all that,\" Edward VIII said. \"Needless to say he died from overexposure.\" Edward VIII, 66, himself was a railroad conductor for 30 years and an accomplished bluegrass musician. Which brings us to Edward IX, 39, of Ravena, N.Y., who is also a gifted bluegrass guitarist and singer, but that's not all. He is a trained operating-room technician, a certified airplane mechanic and a former Greyhound bus driver. He is a member of a single-malt Scotch society. He knows quite a bit about cheese. \"I've been referred to as a renaissance man,\" he said. As of yesterday, though, he was the former sole breadwinner for a family of three, freshly unemployed and uninsured. His son, Edward X, age 3 1/2, sat in the next room, watching an old Superman episode on TV. Edward IX said he hoped that out of all this publicity he might get a job. He was asked if the illustrious numeral might help his résumé. \"Maybe that'll be a bolster to my cachet,\" he said.",

The city opened cooling centers for residents while firefighters were on alert for wildfires, but there was little wind amid the onslaught of dry heat. Downtown hit 113 degrees for a few minutes about 12:15 p.m., breaking the former record of 112 set on June 26, 1990, said Stuart Seto of the National Weather Service office in Oxnard. Temperature records for downtown date to 1877. It was not clear whether 113 would remain the day’s high. The previous record high for a Sept. 27 was 106.",
