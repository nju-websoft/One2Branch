    "source": "Jack Sock Picks Up Where He Left Off at Last Year’s U.S. Open <eos> When we last saw Jack Sock at the United States Open , a year ago September, he was holding a trophy over his head and — not yet 19 and a newly declared professional — being hailed a Grand Slam champion. Granted, as major titles go, mixed doubles (with Melanie Oudin) was akin to a serving of cheese and crackers, with the steak, or singles title, still lodged in the freezer. But as Sock had the previous year also won the junior boys title in Flushing Meadows and, with legend holding that he had never lost a high school match, it was natural — at least hopeful — to think he might have a healthy share of winning genes to go with his booming serve. And his name, for goodness sakes, is Jack Sock; of Lincoln, Neb., a proud Cornhusker. Does it get any more wholesome and hearty for a country in a continuous search for its next men’s star in this athletically enhanced smash-mouth era? So after Sock introduced himself to Florian Mayer, a German seeded 22nd, with a sizzling ace down the T and held serve to begin a first-round match Monday on the grandstand court, fans responded with a chant of “Let’s Go Sock!” Forgetting for the moment that New York is a Yankees town, it was better than one alternative — Sock it to him — and completely understandable as Sock was in the process of feeding America’s slam its first helping of nationalistic fervor by overpowering Mayer, who retired while trailing, 6-3, 6-2, 3-2. One or two more performances like this and we can expect a slew of word play headlines, beginning with Sock and Awe. It doesn’t take much to fire up the Next Great American news media machine, not that Sock is lacking in confidence or ambition. “I feel like my game is right on the verge of going to the next level,” he said after winning his fourth tour match of 2012 against six losses. To explain what he meant of taking his game to the “next level,” put it this way: from his current ranking, 243, there are many stops to make on the ride to the dizzying heights where Roger Federer and elite company reside — beginning with leaping into position near another young and hopeful Yank, Ryan Harrison, currently No. 61. On the scale of youthful and potential men’s tour heirs, the 21-year-old Milos Raonic of Canada is the closest to a major breakthrough, though it is also difficult to define what even that means when three players — Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic — have won 29 of the last 30 slam titles and show little inclination of easing their chokehold. Compared with what the more promising newbies face these days, the emergent superstars of yore practically took their Grand Slam treats by merely growing tall enough to reach into the cookie jar. Boris Becker won Wimbledon as a 17-year-old mop-haired redhead. John McEnroe and Pete Sampras broke through in New York at 20 and 19. Into the 21st century, Nadal began his domination of the French Open at 19, Djokovic won the Australian Open at 21 and Federer sank to his knees at Wimbledon weeks before turning 22. These days, it is unfathomable to think of a skinny and moon-balling Michael Chang winning the French Open at 17, as he did in 1989, or a teenager winning any of the slams. “I don’t think that’s going to be the case any time soon because this game is so physical now and people need to grow into their body,” said John Isner, who at 27 has reason to believe that his best results, whatever they may be, are still ahead of him. At 31, Federer, who absurdly has not missed a Grand Slam tournament in 13 years, may be the best-conditioned of all. Andy Murray, at 25, is thought to be on the verge of his prime. It is mind-boggling to think that Bjorn Borg, McEnroe, Becker and others were playing on fumes, their best matches behind them, by their mid-20s. A no-kidding adult’s tour that provides longevity and personal context is so much richer than the alternative. But given such dramatic career clock changes, patience may be a most valuable virtue for players like Raonic, Harrison and Bernard Tomic of Australia. “Those guys, it might take them a little while to see their very, very best results, but they’re certainly not doing so bad right now,” said Isner, who didn’t hesitate to include Sock, calling him “a very good player.” Sock is a strapping ’Husker, 6 feet 1 inch, 180 pounds, but he was set back physically in March by surgery to repair a torn abdominal muscle. In a brilliant stroke, he has been working in Las Vegas with the trainer Gil Reyes, who whipped the once-profligate Andre Agassi into shape. He has hired the former Swedish player, Joakim Nystrom, to help him play a more patient game. On today’s altered career time clock, there is no choice but to wait one’s turn and see what happens. In a microcosm of that strategy, Sock fell behind, 0-40, while serving at 4-2 in the first set, rallied to deuce, kept his cool as Mayer challenged two line calls and won both, and wound up winning the long game with the help of his own challenge of an out call. He was never threatened after that, cranking his first serve as high as 134 miles per hour, winning 17 of 25 second-service points and shrugging off the question of when the Next Great American will arrive as easily as he did Mayer. “Until the results are there, until the rankings and everything is there, not a different answer to give,” he said. Give him time, in other words. By today’s standards, he’s got a few years before we have to stop asking.",

    "source": "Two Long-Established Marketers Loosen Up <eos> Two big advertisers known for the traditional ways they marketed products are expanding their efforts to become a little less conventional. Both, coincidentally, share the same creative and media agencies, which are also trying to demonstrate their eagerness to explore the brave world of new media. The advertisers are the General Electric Company and the Pepsi-Cola North America unit of PepsiCo. The agencies are both part of the Omnicom Group: BBDO Worldwide in New York for the creative parts of the campaigns and OMD for the media elements. G.E., which in May experimented with new media like digital video recorders in a campaign called G.E. One Second Theater, is introducing today an initiative called G.E.’s Imagination Theater. There are four short films, live-action and animated, which are intended to illustrate in humorous fashion the idea that imaginative approaches can solve challenging problems. Everyone on Madison Avenue “is looking to push the envelope, find what is going to be the next big thing,” said Jennifer Gordineer, group director for national investment on the PepsiCo account at OMD in New York. The shorts can be watched free on the video-on-demand service available to customers of Time Warner Cable systems in cities including Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston, Milwaukee and New York. After each short is released on cable, it will go up on a section of the G.E. Web site (ge.com/imaginationtheater) as well as on sites like myspace.com, video.google.com and youtube.com. And for the Mountain Dew MDX soft drink, Pepsi-Cola North America begins today to present offbeat commercials online (staysharp.tv) and on television. The spots feature video clips created by consumers, which have appeared on Web sites like YouTube, as well as excerpts from popular TV series that include “Futurama.” “You want to focus first on who you are trying to reach” with an ad, Ms. Gordineer said, rather than on the kind of media in which the ad will appear, and then strive to “capture their attention in a way that has not been done before.” At General Electric, said Judy L. Hu, global executive director for advertising and branding, “we’re always challenging our agencies to come up with new ways of reaching people in a world where they’re increasingly in control of what they watch and when.” The One Second Theater experiment “performed really well,” Ms. Hu said, citing data from TiVo showing that “viewers spent three and a half times longer with the commercials than other commercials” not part of the campaign. The experiment offered owners of TiVos and other DVRs the chance to pause the spots and watch additional material frame by frame that had been inserted specifically for played-back viewing. Viewers who watched the commercials live glimpsed only a blur that lasted for, yes, one second. The “Imagination Theater” shorts will be available on the Movie Trailers on Demand channels of the cable systems, alongside previews of theatrical films. After the first short, “The Crossing,” begins today, the others will start running next Monday (“Cubicle”), Dec. 4 (“Birth”) and Dec. 18 (“Samurai”). The shorts will follow a similarly staggered schedule as they go up on the G.E. Web site; BBDO and OMD are working with the online agency for G.E., Blitz. Promotions for Imagination Theater include teaser spots to run on the cable systems, ads in Entertainment Weekly magazine and signs resembling movie posters pasted up at construction sites. The four shorts were produced from 159 scripts submitted by “the 100 creative people of the entire agency, not just those who work on the G.E. account,” said David Lubars, chairman and chief creative officer for the BBDO North American operations. “We were trained here to do things a certain kind of way,” Mr. Lubars said of the BBDO New York creative staff and its legendary devotion to expensive TV commercials replete with celebrities and special effects. Now, “we can get things done in guerrilla ways,” he added. A principal difference between then and now, said Bill Bruce, the chief creative officer at the BBDO New York office who oversaw the MDX campaign, is that “the lines between creative and media are blurred.” “You’ll be seeing more and more of this from BBDO,” Mr. Bruce said. The MDX campaign will appear on the staysharp.tv Web site as well as TV shows on MTV, Spike TV and Adult Swim, the late-night programming block on Cartoon Network. The commercials will present quizzes intended as brain teasers, to make the point that MDX helps its target consumers — males ages 12 to 34 — to “stay sharp.” “It’s becoming more and more apparent that you have to go beyond the traditional 30-second spot,” said Frank Cooper, vice president for marketing the flavored soft drinks sold by Pepsi-Cola North America, because “viewers have become extremely sophisticated at avoiding them.” Some MDX commercials will present the video clips created by consumers, selected from among the fare on youtube.com and other video-sharing Web sites that are popular with younger consumers. The clips include an acrobatic dance by clay figurines, a deliberately bad spoof song called “Elektronic Supersonik,” and daily snapshots of the life of Ben Popik, a young comedian. The commercials conclude with questions about the contents of the clips. To learn the answers, viewers are directed to staysharp.tv — where presumably they will linger to discover more about the product. Other MDX commercials, in a postmodern touch, will refer directly to the programs they are interrupting. For instance, a block of commercials during “Futurama” on Adult Swim will begin with a five-second spot for MDX, asking a question about a newspaper that a character was reading in the show. Then, viewers will see several commercials from other advertisers. MDX will return in the final 10 seconds of the commercial block with a spot answering the question and asking viewers to visit staysharp.tv. After that, the episode of “Futurama” resumes. “It requires a lot of manpower, collaboration and coordination” to create, produce and schedule the commercials that refer to the shows in which they appear, Ms. Gordineer of OMD says. But “we want to keep a viewer engaged during the commercial break in a way that says, ‘Wow, MDX is talking to me,’ ” she added. By coincidence, grouper.com, a video-sharing Web site, introduced last week a channel named Screen Bites where visitors can watch clips from movies and TV shows produced by Columbia Pictures, which like grouper.com is owned by Sony. Among the clips: the scene from the 1976 film “Taxi Driver” in which Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) asks, “You talkin’ to me?”",

    "source": "Japan Goes From Dynamic to Disheartened <eos> OSAKA, Japan — Like many members of Japan ’s middle class, Masato Y. enjoyed a level of affluence two decades ago that was the envy of the world. Masato, a small-business owner, bought a $500,000 condominium, vacationed in Hawaii and drove a late-model Mercedes. But his living standards slowly crumbled along with Japan’s overall economy. First, he was forced to reduce trips abroad and then eliminate them. Then he traded the Mercedes for a cheaper domestic model. Last year, he sold his condo — for a third of what he paid for it, and for less than what he still owed on the mortgage he took out 17 years ago. “Japan used to be so flashy and upbeat, but now everyone must live in a dark and subdued way,” said Masato, 49, who asked that his full name not be used because he still cannot repay the $110,000 that he owes on the mortgage. Few nations in recent history have seen such a striking reversal of economic fortune as Japan. The original Asian success story, Japan rode one of the great speculative stock and property bubbles of all time in the 1980s to become the first Asian country to challenge the long dominance of the West. But the bubbles popped in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and Japan fell into a slow but relentless decline that neither enormous budget deficits nor a flood of easy money has reversed. For nearly a generation now, the nation has been trapped in low growth and a corrosive downward spiral of prices, known as deflation , in the process shriveling from an economic Godzilla to little more than an afterthought in the global economy. Now, as the United States and other Western nations struggle to recover from a debt and property bubble of their own, a growing number of economists are pointing to Japan as a dark vision of the future. Even as the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, prepares a fresh round of unconventional measures to stimulate the economy, there are growing fears that the United States and many European economies could face a prolonged period of slow growth or even, in the worst case, deflation, something not seen on a sustained basis outside Japan since the Great Depression . Many economists remain confident that the United States will avoid the stagnation of Japan, largely because of the greater responsiveness of the American political system and Americans’ greater tolerance for capitalism’s creative destruction. Japanese leaders at first denied the severity of their nation’s problems and then spent heavily on job-creating public works projects that only postponed painful but necessary structural changes, economists say. “We’re not Japan,” said Robert E. Hall, a professor of economics at Stanford. “In America, the bet is still that we will somehow find ways to get people spending and investing again.” Still, as political pressure builds to reduce federal spending and budget deficits, other economists are now warning of “Japanification” — of falling into the same deflationary trap of collapsed demand that occurs when consumers refuse to consume, corporations hold back on investments and banks sit on cash. It becomes a vicious, self-reinforcing cycle: as prices fall further and jobs disappear, consumers tighten their purse strings even more and companies cut back on spending and delay expansion plans. “The U.S., the U.K., Spain, Ireland, they all are going through what Japan went through a decade or so ago,” said Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Securities who recently wrote a book about Japan’s lessons for the world. “Millions of individuals and companies see their balance sheets going underwater, so they are using their cash to pay down debt instead of borrowing and spending.” Just as inflation scarred a generation of Americans, deflation has left a deep imprint on the Japanese, breeding generational tensions and a culture of pessimism, fatalism and reduced expectations. While Japan remains in many ways a prosperous society, it faces an increasingly grim situation, particularly outside the relative economic vibrancy of Tokyo, and its situation provides a possible glimpse into the future for the United States and Europe, should the most dire forecasts come to pass. Scaled-Back Ambitions The downsizing of Japan’s ambitions can be seen on the streets of Tokyo, where concrete “microhouses” have become popular among younger Japanese who cannot afford even the famously cramped housing of their parents, or lack the job security to take out a traditional multidecade loan. These matchbox-size homes stand on plots of land barely large enough to park a sport utility vehicle, yet have three stories of closet-size bedrooms, suitcase-size closets and a tiny kitchen that properly belongs on a submarine. “This is how to own a house even when you are uneasy about the future,” said Kimiyo Kondo, general manager at Zaus, a Tokyo-based company that builds microhouses. For many people under 40, it is hard to grasp just how far this is from the 1980s, when a mighty — and threatening — “Japan Inc.” seemed ready to obliterate whole American industries, from automakers to supercomputers. With the Japanese stock market quadrupling and the yen rising to unimagined heights, Japan’s companies dominated global business, gobbling up trophy properties like Hollywood movie studios (Universal Studios and Columbia Pictures), famous golf courses (Pebble Beach) and iconic real estate (Rockefeller Center). In 1991, economists were predicting that Japan would overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy by 2010. In fact, Japan’s economy remains the same size it was then: a gross domestic product of $5.7 trillion at current exchange rates. During the same period, the United States economy doubled in size to $14.7 trillion, and this year China overtook Japan to become the world’s No. 2 economy. China has so thoroughly eclipsed Japan that few American intellectuals seem to bother with Japan now, and once crowded Japanese-language classes at American universities have emptied. Even Clyde V. Prestowitz, a former Reagan administration trade negotiator whose writings in the 1980s about Japan’s threat to the United States once stirred alarm in Washington, said he was now studying Chinese. “I hardly go to Japan anymore,” Mr. Prestowitz said. The decline has been painful for the Japanese, with companies and individuals like Masato having lost the equivalent of trillions of dollars in the stock market, which is now just a quarter of its value in 1989, and in real estate, where the average price of a home is the same as it was in 1983. And the future looks even bleaker, as Japan faces the world’s largest government debt — around 200 percent of gross domestic product — a shrinking population and rising rates of poverty and suicide. But perhaps the most noticeable impact here has been Japan’s crisis of confidence. Just two decades ago, this was a vibrant nation filled with energy and ambition, proud to the point of arrogance and eager to create a new economic order in Asia based on the yen. Today, those high-flying ambitions have been shelved, replaced by weariness and fear of the future, and an almost stifling air of resignation. Japan seems to have pulled into a shell, content to accept its slow fade from the global stage. Its once voracious manufacturers now seem prepared to surrender industry after industry to hungry South Korean and Chinese rivals. Japanese consumers, who once flew by the planeload on flashy shopping trips to Manhattan and Paris, stay home more often now, saving their money for an uncertain future or setting new trends in frugality with discount brands like Uniqlo. As living standards in this still wealthy nation slowly erode, a new frugality is apparent among a generation of young Japanese, who have known nothing but economic stagnation and deflation. They refuse to buy big-ticket items like cars or televisions, and fewer choose to study abroad in America. Japan’s loss of gumption is most visible among its young men, who are widely derided as “herbivores” for lacking their elders’ willingness to toil for endless hours at the office, or even to succeed in romance, which many here blame, only half jokingly, for their country’s shrinking birthrate. “The Japanese used to be called economic animals,” said Mitsuo Ohashi, former chief executive officer of the chemicals giant Showa Denko. “But somewhere along the way, Japan lost its animal spirits.” When asked in dozens of interviews about their nation’s decline, Japanese, from policy makers and corporate chieftains to shoppers on the street, repeatedly mention this startling loss of vitality. While Japan suffers from many problems, most prominently the rapid graying of its society, it is this decline of a once wealthy and dynamic nation into a deep social and cultural rut that is perhaps Japan’s most ominous lesson for the world today. The classic explanation of the evils of deflation is that it makes individuals and businesses less willing to use money, because the rational way to act when prices are falling is to hold onto cash, which gains in value. But in Japan, nearly a generation of deflation has had a much deeper effect, subconsciously coloring how the Japanese view the world. It has bred a deep pessimism about the future and a fear of taking risks that make people instinctively reluctant to spend or invest, driving down demand — and prices — even further. “A new common sense appears, in which consumers see it as irrational or even foolish to buy or borrow,” said Kazuhisa Takemura, a professor at Waseda University in Tokyo who has studied the psychology of deflation. A Deflated City While the effects are felt across Japan’s economy, they are more apparent in regions like Osaka, the third-largest city, than in relatively prosperous Tokyo. In this proudly commercial city, merchants have gone to extremes to coax shell-shocked shoppers into spending again. But this often takes the shape of price wars that end up only feeding Japan’s deflationary spiral. There are vending machines that sell canned drinks for 10 yen, or 12 cents; restaurants with 50-yen beer; apartments with the first month’s rent of just 100 yen, about $1.22. Even marriage ceremonies are on sale, with discount wedding halls offering weddings for $600 — less than a tenth of what ceremonies typically cost here just a decade ago. On Senbayashi, an Osaka shopping street, merchants recently held a 100-yen day, offering much of their merchandise for that price. Even then, they said, the results were disappointing. “It’s like Japanese have even lost the desire to look good,” said Akiko Oka, 63, who works part time in a small apparel shop, a job she has held since her own clothing store went bankrupt in 2002. This loss of vigor is sometimes felt in unusual places. Kitashinchi is Osaka’s premier entertainment district, a three-centuries-old playground where the night is filled with neon signs and hostesses in tight dresses, where just taking a seat at a top club can cost $500. But in the past 15 years, the number of fashionable clubs and lounges has shrunk to 480 from 1,200, replaced by discount bars and chain restaurants. Bartenders say the clientele these days is too cost-conscious to show the studied disregard for money that was long considered the height of refinement. “A special culture might be vanishing,” said Takao Oda, who mixes perfectly crafted cocktails behind the glittering gold countertop at his Bar Oda. After years of complacency, Japan appears to be waking up to its problems, as seen last year when disgruntled voters ended the virtual postwar monopoly on power of the Liberal Democratic Party. However, for many Japanese, it may be too late. Japan has already created an entire generation of young people who say they have given up on believing that they can ever enjoy the job stability or rising living standards that were once considered a birthright here. Yukari Higaki, 24, said the only economic conditions she had ever known were ones in which prices and salaries seemed to be in permanent decline. She saves as much money as she can by buying her clothes at discount stores, making her own lunches and forgoing travel abroad. She said that while her generation still lived comfortably, she and her peers were always in a defensive crouch, ready for the worst. “We are the survival generation,” said Ms. Higaki, who works part time at a furniture store. Hisakazu Matsuda, president of Japan Consumer Marketing Research Institute, who has written several books on Japanese consumers, has a different name for Japanese in their 20s; he calls them the consumption-haters. He estimates that by the time this generation hits their 60s, their habits of frugality will have cost the Japanese economy $420 billion in lost consumption. “There is no other generation like this in the world,” Mr. Matsuda said. “These guys think it’s stupid to spend.” Deflation has also affected businesspeople by forcing them to invent new ways to survive in an economy where prices and profits only go down, not up. Yoshinori Kaiami was a real estate agent in Osaka, where, like the rest of Japan, land prices have been falling for most of the past 19 years. Mr. Kaiami said business was tough. There were few buyers in a market that was virtually guaranteed to produce losses, and few sellers, because most homeowners were saddled with loans that were worth more than their homes. Some years ago, he came up with an idea to break the gridlock. He created a company that guides homeowners through an elaborate legal subterfuge in which they erase the original loan by declaring personal bankruptcy , but continue to live in their home by “selling” it to a relative, who takes out a smaller loan to pay its greatly reduced price. “If we only had inflation again, this sort of business would not be necessary,” said Mr. Kaiami, referring to the rising prices that are the opposite of deflation. “I feel like I’ve been waiting for 20 years for inflation to come back.” One of his customers was Masato, the small-business owner, who sold his four-bedroom condo to a relative for about $185,000, 15 years after buying it for a bit more than $500,000. He said he was still deliberating about whether to expunge the $110,000 he still owed his bank by declaring personal bankruptcy. Economists said one reason deflation became self-perpetuating was that it pushed companies and people like Masato to survive by cutting costs and selling what they already owned, instead of buying new goods or investing. “Deflation destroys the risk-taking that capitalist economies need in order to grow,” said Shumpei Takemori, an economist at Keio University in Tokyo. “Creative destruction is replaced with what is just destructive destruction.”",

    "source": "EBay Urges New Passwords After Breach <eos> SAN FRANCISCO — In the latest prominent breach of a company’s computer network, hackers have infiltrated the online marketplace eBay, gaining access to the personal data of 145 million customers, the company said on Wednesday. The hackers broke into an eBay database containing names, email addresses, birth dates, encrypted passwords, physical addresses and phone numbers. There was no indication that the attackers obtained financial information such as credit and debit card numbers or gained access to customer accounts at PayPal, which is owned by eBay, said Amanda Miller, a company spokeswoman. The company has not seen evidence of fraudulent activity that could be linked to the breach, she said. Still, hackers could use the stolen data for identity theft. Personal information — such as email addresses, passwords and birth dates — is regularly sold to criminals who use it for phishing or identity theft. Security experts warned that the stolen information would make eBay customers easy targets for phishing attacks, in which criminals send emails that bait victims into clicking on malicious links or direct them to fake log-in screens where they are asked to enter more valuable information like a password or a Social Security number. “Expect an uptick in phishing. Do not click links in email or discuss anything over the phone,” warned Trey Ford, a strategist at Rapid7, a security firm in Boston. EBay discovered the breach this month when the company’s internal security team noticed that some of its employees were engaged in unusual activity on its corporate network, said Mark Carges, the company’s chief technology officer. EBay contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s San Francisco office as well as an outside computer forensics firm. Working together, they found that hackers had been inside eBay’s corporate network since late February. By studying computer logs, eBay discovered that hackers had stolen the credentials of several of its employees and gained unauthorized access to eBay’s corporate network. Once inside, they were able to copy a database containing information on all 145 million of the company’s customers, according to Alan Marks, eBay’s senior vice president of global communications. Mr. Marks said eBay stored its financial data separately. Still, the company advised users with the same password for eBay and PayPal to change their passwords immediately. Though notification laws differ, most states require that companies notify customers of a breach only if their names are compromised in combination with other information like a credit card or a Social Security number. But there are exceptions for encrypted information. In eBay’s case, the company stored users’ names, email and physical addresses and birth dates in plain text but encrypted their passwords. Most states would not have required eBay to disclose the breach. But one state, North Dakota, requires companies to disclose a breach in cases where a customer’s name is compromised in conjunction with a birth date. Mr. Carges said eBay camouflaged customers’ passwords with encryption, using a process known as hashing, in which passwords are mashed up with a mathematical algorithm and stored only in encoded or “hashed” form. To make cracking more difficult, Mr. Carges said, eBay also appended several random digits to customer passwords — a process known as salting — before encrypting the passwords. Salting makes cracking them more difficult, although not impossible. Mr. Marks said that on Wednesday the company would begin prompting users to change their passwords and alerting customers to the breach. Peter D. Lee, a spokesman for the F.B.I.’s San Francisco field office, said the F.B.I. was working closely with eBay to investigate the breach and that he believed that arrests would be made soon. The breach at eBay is one of several recent hacking episodes at prominent companies. One that struck Target in December has cost the retailer $87 million in breach-related expenses, according to securities filings.",

She graduated in 2010 with a B.A. in marketing from LIM College in Midtown Manhattan, became Kristy Whitwell when she married her hometown sweetheart in July, and was hired last August as the event and party coordinator at the Scholastic Store in SoHo. Ms. Whitwell, 24, lives on Roosevelt Island with her husband, David, a classical trombonist attending the Brooklyn College Conservatory of Music . Young fashionista: My dream was to move to New York. From third grade, I remember how seriously I took my outfits. I loved all the fashion magazines. But Cosmo was out. My mom wouldn’t let me get it. Shutterbug: My dad had an old Canon 35-millimeter and he let me use it. After I came to New York for college, I did a lot of baby-sitting, and used my connections to start a small business doing children’s portraits. It’s called Petit Chat ; it’s on a lot of “mommy blogs.” College of choice: When I was 15 we had a college fair at my high school, and I found LIM, a college for the business of fashion, exactly what I was looking for. I went home and told my parents and they laughed at me and said no way was I going to New York. I worked on them for two years. I applied to other schools, like Saint Louis University , and got in, but we all knew that when the time came, I was going to LIM. The h otel life: My freshman year, I lived at the New Yorker Hotel ; my school has dorms there. I actually stayed there on a trip to New York City when I was 13, so I took this as a sign. Internships: In 2007 I interned at Oscar de la Renta for two months in marketing and accessories sales. In my senior year I did a six-month internship at Seventeen in the photo department. It confirmed my love for production work, but by the time I left, the department had been cut in half. Surfing for a job: Last summer I had this routine where the first thing I did when I woke up was check my school’s career service site, check the Time Inc. site and Hearst and Condé Nast : there were internships, but I felt like now that I had a degree, I wanted an adult job. One day I went to the Scholastic Web site and saw an opening for an event and party coordinator. It was a job I hadn’t thought of, but I figured, why not, I love children and organizing events. Party time: We do up to six birthday parties each weekend, and every Saturday there’s an event at the SoHo store; the scavenger hunt for 30 teams is the most elaborate event I’ve done so far. I just finished a birthday party for a 5-year-old boy. The theme was superheroes, and everybody designed their own mask and cape. Tantrum du jour: One time our 3-year-old birthday girl began crying during story time and nobody knew why. Then we realized she was having a tantrum because she wanted to turn the pages. Now we always let the birthday child turn the pages: a 3-year-old set policy! Down the road: I see myself getting into marketing and growing with the company. This is definitely a world I could get used to. I don’t miss fashion; all my friends are in fashion, and I’ve got my Bloomingdale’s one subway stop from home. Plus one in SoHo!",

    "source": "In Rail Link, Angelenos See a Door to Prosperity <eos> LOS ANGELES, Sept. 3 — While Carlos Sanchez, a guitarist, waits in front of Mariachi Plaza in Boyle Heights to be picked up for his next job, he likes to look at a mural behind the plaza’s kiosk on First Street. The mural, with colorful squares and spheres and scenes of local flavor, is reminiscent of the work of Mexican muralists like David Alfaro Siqueiros, but it is functional, too. It hides construction of a light-rail link that supporters in Boyle Heights and neighboring East Los Angeles say will change the face of their communities. Boyle Heights, part of the City of Los Angeles, and East Los Angeles, an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County, have long been home to thousands of Latinos. Both communities are cut off geographically from the city’s beach districts and central business areas. The light-rail train, set to begin running in 2009, will allow passengers to get to areas throughout the county. For many low-income residents, like Mr. Sanchez, 38, who do not own cars, the train will replace bicycles, unreliable buses and costly taxis. “I’ll be using the train because it’s going to be more convenient and a faster way to get to where you want to go,” said Mr. Sanchez, who often car-pools to jobs with fellow musicians. The train, named after Edward R. Roybal, who in 1949 became the first Mexican-American elected to the Los Angeles City Council, will travel six miles from the Little Tokyo/Arts District in downtown through Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles. It will link to the Los Angeles subway system on the Gold Line, which runs south from Pasadena. A one-way trip now costs $1.25. Diana Tarango, who is on an advisory committee for the project, said the light-rail link had been in the works for 12 years. “The Gold Line is a method of transportation that is very much needed in East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights because we’re so transit dependent,” she said. “So many of our people do go out to work in houses in West L.A.,” she said. “In order to get there, why shouldn’t they have the luxury of something comfortable, fast and running on schedule?” Community advocates see the train as a possible gateway to improving East Los Angeles and bringing economic vitality to the area, the oldest Mexican-American community in the county. Standing before Mariachi Plaza, so named because Mexican musicians gather there to wait for work, José Huizar, a Los Angeles city councilman, spoke of plans to transform the intersection at First and Boyle Streets, which is a jumble of construction sites and small businesses. “The potential here is tremendous,” said Mr. Huizar, who grew up in Boyle Heights. “My vision for this area is to have restaurants and a commercial center here. We’re going to have a lot of people from downtown coming up here during lunchtime. They’ll be on the subway in five minutes and get here and listen to mariachi music during the day and evening.” The area’s county supervisor, Gloria Molina, said the light rail was part of what she called the renaissance of East Los Angeles. “The first thing you do is upgrade the area,” Ms. Molina said, “and that will attract private investment.” She said a Starbucks opened in East Los Angeles in March, and a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and a Quiznos sandwich shop opened three years ago. But there are no major stores like Target in the area. The storefronts that line major streets are small businesses like clothing stores and restaurants trying to keep a foothold as local shoppers head to stores and malls in nearby cities. The makeup of Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles has changed little since the late 1960s. Both areas are known for their large Latino populations and for Mexican-themed murals on convenience stores, schools and public buildings. But that has not always been the case, said George Sanchez, a history professor at the University of Southern California. At one time, Boyle Heights had significant Jewish and Japanese communities. Other ethnic groups, including Russians and Italians, also called the area home. “Boyle Heights from the 1920s to the 1950s was the most diverse suburb in both the city of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County,” said Mr. Sanchez. Evidence of the region’s past cultural diversity also extends to East Los Angeles, where Jewish, Serbian and Chinese cemeteries can be found. Proof that Chinese residents worked on the railroads in the 1800s was unearthed in the form of grave markers and bones during the construction of the light-rail project. “The one thing you can say about East L.A. is that it’s never had an identity crisis,” said Oscar Gonzales, president of the East Los Angeles Residents Association. “It’s always known of its history and, more important, its future.” That future, with the rail line, may be gentrification, Ms. Molina and others say. “It should change for the better,” she said. “You’re going to see more businesses along the transit lines.”",

    "source": "How the Media Adapt at the Republican National Convention <eos> TAMPA, Fla. — Strange things are happening inside the media workspaces at the Republican National Convention. The Washington Post has built a miniature television set in its offices, complete with a comfy sofa and coffee table reminiscent of “The Oprah Winfrey Show.” The Huffington Post , that emblem of new media’s speed and vigor, is putting out a magazine with the slogan “Embrace the Slow News Movement.” And Diane Sawyer is pulling double duty: anchoring “ABC World News” and taping videos for Yahoo . Media organizations have turned the political parties’ quadrennial gatherings this year into laboratories of innovation and experimentation, straying from their traditional areas of expertise as they search for new ways to engage readers and audiences. So far, it seems, the new media has decided that it wants to be the old media, and the old media has decided that it wants to be the new media. “Everybody is trying to be in everybody else’s space,” said Marcus W. Brauchli, executive editor of The Washington Post. “There are so many people covering politics now, and everybody competes on every platform. So in order to demonstrate your commitment and authority, it’s important to be present in every medium. And we are.” Convention coverage has come a long way from the days when the “boys on the bus” — the pack of A-list print reporters like R. W. Apple Jr. of The New York Times, David S. Broder of The Washington Post and Walter R. Mears of The Associated Press — set the pace for political reporting more than a generation ago armed with little more than a pen, a pad and a wicked hangover. Back then, conventions were less scripted and generated more surprises, while today’s media labor to enliven coverage of what typically are endless hours of preordained events. Now, Mr. Mears’s Associated Press occupies a skybox at the Tampa Bay Times Forum, the site of the convention, where it shoots and broadcasts high-definition video. This year, the one accessory most newspapers cannot seem to do without is a set with cameras and television lights. The New York Times has its own skybox as well, and for the first time is providing live-streamed coverage of a convention. The Washington Post records several hours a day of webcasts from its pop-up set inside the convention center here. It has also partnered with a start-up company called Socialcam that allows it to post video vignettes of conventiongoers that are recorded on iPhones by a team of interns. ABC News has partnered with Yahoo and is streaming 30 hours of coverage with an anchor online. NBC News and CBS News will both stream the convention live from gavel to gavel on their Web sites. CNN and Fox News, evidently not content with their round-the-clock platforms on cable, are also offering extensive streaming coverage. Even “PBS NewsHour” is offering 24-hour Web streaming. As more traditional media like newspapers and television explore new media possibilities, new media outlets are going in the opposite direction. The Huffington Post has started producing a magazine for the iPad that focuses on the kind of long-form journalism that it is best known for aggregating from other publications. Arianna Huffington, for whom The Post is named, said in an interview that she came to realize that people like a break from the rapid-fire news cycle, which can overload readers. “We are all recognizing that we are paying a heavy price for hyper-connectivity,” she said. Politico, which upended the conventional political news cycle as a start-up five years ago, has partnered with no less a hallmark of eat-your-vegetables journalism than C-Span to simulcast its live Web coverage. And its print articles during the Republican convention are appearing in The Tampa Bay Times. John F. Harris, Politico’s editor in chief, explained these rather incongruous partnerships as a way of remaining relevant in a media environment that is rapidly evolving. “You can never be complacent about where you find your audience and how you connect with your audience,” he said. No one seems quite sure where these experiments will end up. Privately, they concede that their streaming Web videos draw extremely low traffic compared with their articles — for smaller organizations, sometimes only a few hundred viewers at a time. News Web sites see tremendous potential in digital video advertising, which commands far higher rates than traditional Web display ads. But so far, the video investments have yet to reap significant rewards. Mr. Harris described Politico’s Web video as “kind of groping cheerfully with a sense of fun and experimentation — and we’re not sure what it becomes.” If the conventions fail to produce much in the way of news these days, the one thing they do generate for news outlets is an unparalleled opportunity to raise their profiles. Bloomberg, which is going beyond its digital roots and publishing a daily print magazine during the convention, has spent more than $1 million to construct an airy, sleek office space here. Caterers serve Nicoise salad with seared tuna, and visitors lounge on white leather couches as New Age music pulses through overhead speakers. “The convention around the convention is the story,” said Kevin Sheekey, chairman of Bloomberg Government, a news service sold to lobbyists and Capitol Hill offices for thousands of dollars a year.",

    "source": "Scott Walker’s Dismal Finish Is a Fitting Result, Old Foes Say <eos> MILWAUKEE — For the last 25 years, Representative Gwen Moore has sought to relinquish her claim to being the only politician ever to defeat Scott Walker. On Monday she learned that her wait would continue, as Mr. Walker, the Wisconsin governor, ended his presidential campaign, bowing to plummeting poll numbers and a Republican electorate that seems to vastly prefer explosive outsiders to a lifelong political operative. Ms. Moore, a Democrat from Milwaukee, was fine with that. “I’m great,” she said. Old political adversaries of Mr. Walker greeted his dour denouement as a fitting result for a politician who they say began and furthered his career here with a divisive style, a penchant for turning out conservative supporters rather than working with opponents, and tacit racial appeals in one of the nation’s most segregated cities. But the irony is that Mr. Walker was eclipsed by candidates who have ignited the Republican base with more overtly nativist and, their critics argue, racist appeals. Mr. Walker first registered on the radar of African-American voters here in September 1990, when The Milwaukee Star, a black newspaper, reported that Ms. Moore, the first African-American woman to hold the Seventh District Assembly seat, was “expected to face formidable opposition in the general election” from Mr. Walker, “who is said to have well-financed and organized support.” That was an overstatement. Mr. Walker was 23, a Marquette University dropout. He had limited funds and enjoyed the help of only a couple of fellow college Republicans. But as he ran for Wisconsin office for the first time by mostly appealing to white college students at Marquette and wealthier white residents near the suburbs, he also advertised in papers catering to the district’s heavily black population. Image Representative Gwen Moore, Democrat of Wisconsin, defeated Mr. Walker for a State Assembly seat in 1990. Credit Zach Gibson/The New York Times “Tired of the violence?” read an ad in the Nov. 3 Milwaukee Courier. “Scott Walker has a plan.” Mr. Walker had left Marquette as a student that spring, only to return to the campus dorm room of John Hiller, a friend who became his campaign treasurer. They and Mike Anani, another student who was running for the State Senate, developed a tough-on-crime platform. The issue was a no-brainer: The college paper, The Marquette Tribune, read like a crime blotter. “MU Student Killed in Random Shooting,” ran an August headline; “Sexual Assault, Robberies During Weekend” ran one that September. A series debated whether the school’s public safety officers should carry weapons. Racial tensions, meanwhile, surfaced on its editorial pages: “Black Power Threatens Society” read one essay, alongside “African American Students Outraged by Racist Opinions.” Steve Loucks, a former Republican Assemblyman in a neighboring district, who as a Marquette alumnus had kept track of the college Republicans, recalled Mr. Walker as unusually ambitious for his age. As it happened, Mr. Loucks and Ms. Moore, who had no car, drove to Madison, the state capital, together each week. Ms. Moore recalled that she learned on those drives that Mr. Walker was someone to keep an eye on, that he polished his speeches in front of a mirror, and that he intended to “persuade white Democrats to just vote color.” Mr. Loucks said he did not recall the substance of those conversations, but said Mr. Walker’s candidacy was seen by state Republicans as a way for him to “build his chops.” Mr. Hiller, meanwhile, described Mr. Walker’s campaign as a ploy to distract Ms. Moore from working on behalf of other Democrats. They acquired lists of likely voters and knocked on doors. Some people did not appreciate the fliers they handed out. Image An ad placed by Mr. Walker's 1990 campaign in The Milwaukee Courier. “I vividly remember the picture of a revolver pointed right at the reader,” said Dale Dulberger, who lived in the district and later ran for and lost a state legislative seat to Mr. Walker. “It was shocking.” Ms. Moore said she believed that Mr. Walker was making a tacit racial appeal to her constituents, and it had worried her. “I was scared that the white people would listen to him,” she said. Mr. Walker’s presidential campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the 1990 election, about which accusations of race baiting have been raised in the past. But Mr. Hiller said there was no racial overtone to the flier, and suggested that Ms. Moore was exaggerating. “If there was a gun, there was a gun,” said Mr. Hiller, but he said there was no racial undertone to the flyer. Ms. Moore, he said, was “making it sound like some racial thing — her memory of it now is just over the top.” Mr. Walker returned to the Marquette campus the day before Halloween for a sparsely attended candidate forum about campus safety. In The Marquette Tribune, which incorrectly identified him as a graduate, he called for more affordable housing, saying “the problems of abandoned and run-down housing leads to drug trafficking and crime in neighborhoods.” But the district’s voters, a majority of them white liberals, roundly rejected Mr. Walker’s ideas. On election night, Mr. Hiller picked him up and drove to Gov. Tommy Thompson’s re-election party in Madison. On the road, a radio announcer mistakenly said Mr. Walker had won, prompting the two to pull over in a state of shock. Then the announcer said he had transposed the results and that Mr. Walker had lost badly. At Mr. Thompson’s party, Mr. Hiller recalled, people kept coming up to Mr. Walker and congratulating him on a tough race, saying he had “helped the cause.” “It gave him some credibility and inroads into the party apparatus,” Mr. Hiller said. “It opened doors with various people and power players.” Those connections paid off as Mr. Walker moved to the suburbs of Milwaukee. From his overwhelmingly white and Republican politician base in Wauwatosa, he sought and won seats in the Assembly and as county executive. In 2006, he ran for governor before bowing out with little support. But he ran again and won in 2010, and then beat Milwaukee’s mayor, Tom Barrett, in a recall election in which Mr. Walker’s old adversaries found his tactics familiar: running against Milwaukee as a murderous, crime-ridden place that should not infect the rest of the state. In his office last week, Mr. Barrett, a Democrat who has been mayor since 2004, grew upbeat at the mention of Mr. Walker’s in the polls. “I’ve really enjoyed my summer reading,” he said.",

    "source": "Jury Is Set for Clemens’s Perjury Trial in Washington <eos> WASHINGTON — Without even a twinge of the intensity he once showed on the mound, Roger Clemens sat in a federal courtroom Tuesday, calmly watching the jurors assigned to his perjury trial slowly and silently take their seats in the jury box. Clemens showed no emotion from the defense table as he looked at the panel — 10 women and 2 men, and 4 alternates — which was chosen from a whittled-down pool of 36 after four long days of questioning. Among the jurors is a woman whose cousin is Al Bumbry, a former Baltimore Orioles outfielder who coached Clemens with the Boston Red Sox; a vegetarian lawyer who considers drug laws in the United States to be “a bit heavy-handed”; and a Philadelphia Eagles fan who thought Michael Vick “was done wrong” when he was convicted for his involvement in a dogfighting ring. The jury also overwhelmingly consists of people who know little about baseball — and even less about Clemens. One of the jurors said during jury selection that she would not recognize Clemens if he was sitting right in front of her. Opening arguments are expected to begin Wednesday, and the estimated length of the trial is four to six weeks. Judge Reggie Walton of United States District Court warned the jurors about the high-profile nature of the case. He told the jurors he would not sequester them, but he is having them meet at an undisclosed site away from the courthouse, so they can be shuttled to the trial in private. They would also be provided daily meals, so they do not have to eat in the courthouse cafeteria — where members of news media and Clemens often eat — or in the surrounding neighborhood where he said people could be nosy. Already, the trial is much different from that of the former Giants slugger Barry Bonds, whose federal perjury trial in San Francisco ended in April with his conviction for obstruction of justice. It took less than one day for a jury to be seated in that trial. For the entire trial, those jurors then arrived at the courthouse on their own through public entrances and often ate in the building’s cafeteria. Philip K. Anthony, the chief executive of DecisionQuest, a nationwide jury-consulting firm, said that Clemens, in many ways, would have it easier than Bonds, at least when it comes to the jury deciding his fate. He said it was to Clemens’s advantage that he had never lived in Washington nor played for a team there. “A jury in someone’s hometown feels a duty to punish that person for bad behavior,” said Anthony, who added, “I think his jury will be more open in evaluating the evidence because they don’t have an ax to grind one way or the other.” The jurors will begin hearing the details of the case Wednesday about a half-mile from the House of Representatives office building in which Clemens testified in 2008 during hearings about the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. He is charged with perjury, making false statements and obstruction of Congress in connection with his testimony, when he said he never used steroids or human growth hormone. On Tuesday, Clemens’s defense team revealed one of its tactics that it hopes will crush the heart of the prosecution’s case. Michael Attanasio, one of Clemens’s lawyers, questioned the basis of the charges against Clemens, saying Congress had no right to investigate performance-enhancing drugs in baseball in the first place. He said the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform should not have held hearings because they had no legislative purpose. The hearings instead focused on a “he-said, he-said debate” between Clemens and his former personal trainer, Brian McNamee, Attanasio said. McNamee, who will be a star witness in the case, told Congress that he injected Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone. He also said that he saw Clemens and Jose Canseco, Clemens’s former teammate, talking at a pool party at Canseco’s Miami home in 1998 and that shortly afterward, Clemens asked McNamee to inject him with drugs for the first time. Clemens testified he never used performance-enhancing drugs and was not at Canseco’s house because he was golfing. “We’re going to have a minitrial on whether Roger Clemens went swimming,” Attanasio said. “We’re going to have a trial in U.S. District Court? Congress is going to have a hearing on these things?” The prosecution argued that the House had the right to investigate the issue of steroids in baseball, particularly because legislation regulating steroid use had precipitated the Mitchell report . That report, by former Senator George J. Mitchell, was a result of an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Clemens questioned that report, in which his name is prominently mentioned. The judge has initially taken the prosecution’s side, saying that if Clemens, “one of the icons of baseball,” was criticizing the report, then, “it seems to me that Congress has the authority to hold hearings to determine which view is correct.”",

    "source": "First Mediator, Then Decision Maker <eos> IRVING, Tex. — Stephen Jones chuckles at the memory of being a mediator between his father, Jerry Jones, the Cowboys’ owner, and Bill Parcells, the headstrong former coach. “It was tough, tough, tough,” said Stephen Jones, the No. 2 executive in the Dallas front office. “But it was worth it.” Jones said it helped shape him into what he is today, the person perceived by some to be calling the shots for the Cowboys as the team’s chief operating officer, executive vice president and director of player personnel. The Cowboys have picked foundation over flash in recent drafts and decided not to stress the salary cap with a big contract for DeMarco Murray after he led the N.F.L. in rushing. Stephen Jones was a key part of in those decisions. Jones, 50, said he believed little had changed in the 26 years that Jerry Jones had been the owner, general manager and ultimate arbiter of the Cowboys, for better or worse. But he did not completely dismiss the notion of an evolving philosophy. “I think probably the biggest way things have changed is that he probably has more confidence in me,” he said, referring to his father. “Although he might not want to say that he didn’t have confidence in me 20 years ago, because I think he did. I think he listened to me a lot. But did he listen as much? Maybe not.” The younger Jones was a 24-year-old chemical engineering graduate of the University of Arkansas, where both he and his father had played football, when Jerry Jones bought the Cowboys in 1989, fired Coach Tom Landry and brought attention to a family that had quietly made its fortune in oil and gas. Admittedly “green behind the ears” as he found himself making decisions alongside Jimmy Johnson, who became the coach in 1989, Stephen Jones was confident in his football background. Looking back, Jones said he figured a healthy part of his growth came in the four years Parcells was with the Cowboys, from 2003 to 2006. Jones’s flamboyant father and Parcells, a Super Bowl-winning coach who had clashed with front offices on personnel issues elsewhere, did not want any “confrontational disagreement,” as the younger Jones put it. So he got to play middleman. “It helped me in a lot of ways,” Jones said. “Because I had to have some real heated, heated visits with both Jerry and Bill.” And he was not afraid of them, said Jeff Ireland, who was then the Cowboys’ director of scouting. Ireland said he remembered that the Cowboys had decided to do something different in the draft room and needed to tell Parcells, who Stephen Jones said was the architect of several changes that made Dallas better. “Stephen didn’t wait for his dad,” Ireland said. “He said, ‘Hey, look, Jeff, we’re going to go and do this, and it’s not going to be a real happy time for us.’ He knows how to handle people. And he knows how to do it without disrespecting them, either.” Jones said his father still had the final decision. That was the case last year when Jerry Jones resisted his headline-grabbing urge during the draft and passed on Johnny Manziel for Zack Martin, a quiet workhorse offensive lineman who became the club’s first rookie All-Pro since Calvin Hill in 1969. The more relevant draft-room drama, Stephen Jones said, is the buildup to each pick. Jones has tried to make his voice heard when his father grows anxious about moving up. “It’s a little fun dynamic in there when he and I are visiting,” Stephen Jones said, smiling. “But he’s a good listener. And I mean he listens more.” Jerry Jones said as much before this year’s draft, when the Cowboys pushed aside their needs at running back and chose Connecticut cornerback Byron Jones in the first round. “Bottom line, without getting into it a lot, Stephen has absolute, tremendous influence on these decisions that are ultimately made in this organization and everything we do,” Jerry Jones said, also noting the input of Coach Jason Garrett. After winning three Super Bowls in the 1990s, the Cowboys worked to maintain the core of those teams, which had players like Emmitt Smith, and had plenty of draft busts. But Morris Claiborne (2012) is the only first-round pick from 2010 to 2014 who has not made a Pro Bowl. And the Cowboys left this year’s draft feeling as if they had three first-rounders in Byron Jones, defensive end Randy Gregory and lineman La’el Collins. Stephen Jones believes the Cowboys are benefiting from the continuity of five-plus years with Garrett as coach. They have not had that since Johnson left in a messy split with Jerry Jones after winning a second straight championship in 1993. Through all the coaching changes, Jerry Jones, 72, had one constant at the top: his son. “I know he looks and treats the franchise as a legacy,” Stephen Jones said. “The big joy comes in working with him and working as a family.”",

    "source": "Commissioner Criticized Over N.F.L.’s Handling of Players’ Brain Injuries <eos> WASHINGTON — The commissioner of the N.F.L. faced heated criticism Wednesday before the House Judiciary Committee, with lawmakers, former players and even a former team executive accusing the league of neglect in its handling of active and retired players with brain injuries. With evidence mounting of a link between playing professional football and cognitive impairment in later life, and news reports of poor medical treatment for some former players with dementia and other signs of mental decline, the committee repeatedly challenged the commissioner, Roger Goodell , to defend the league’s policies and research. “The N.F.L. sort of has this blanket denial or minimizing of the fact that there may be this link,” Representative Linda T. Sánchez, Democrat of California, said to Mr. Goodell during the daylong hearing. “And it sort of reminds me of the tobacco companies pre-’90s when they kept saying, ‘Oh, there’s no link between smoking and damage to your health.’ ” When pressed, Mr. Goodell would not say whether he thought there was a link between football and cognitive decline among N.F.L. players. He did say, “I can think of no issue to which I’ve devoted more time and attention than the health and well-being of our players, and particularly retired players.” “We are changing the culture of our game for the better,” he later added. In his opening statement, the committee chairman, Representative John Conyers Jr. said the issue of brain injuries in football warranted federal scrutiny because “the N.F.L. is a monopoly whose existence was legislatively sanctioned,” referring to the antitrust exemption for broadcasting that has helped the league grow into a multibillion-dollar operation. The league is also arguing a case before the Supreme Court hoping to expand its antitrust privileges. “I say this not simply because of the impact of these injuries on the 2,000 current players and more than 10,000 retirees associated with the N.F.L. and their families,” said Mr. Conyers, Democrat of Michigan. “I say it because of the effect on the millions of players at the college, high school and youth levels.” Several Republican members of the committee said that Congress should have no role in regulating football on either the professional or youth levels. “We cannot legislate the elimination of injuries from the games without eliminating the games themselves,” said Representative Lamar S. Smith, Republican of Texas. The hearing included testimony from Mr. Goodell and the players union’s executive director, DeMaurice Smith; doctors from the league’s committee on concussions; and researchers who have found brain damage commonly associated with boxers in 10 deceased N.F.L. players, most of them younger than 55. Tiki Barber, Merrill Hoge and George Martin, all former players, and Gay Culverhouse, a former Tampa Bay Buccaneers team president, gave inside views of league medical trends. Family members of injured players also testified: Eleanor Perfetto, whose husband, Ralph Wenzel, is now is institutionalized with dementia at age 66; and Dick Benson, whose teenage son died of a brain hemorrhage in 2002 after repeated concussions playing high school football. Missing from the two panels of witnesses was Dr. Ira Casson, the co-chairman of the N.F.L.’s committee, who has been criticized for discrediting outside research and for his role in the league’s study of brain injuries in retired players. Independent experts have said the study is flawed by conflicts of interest, statistical and sampling problems. None of the three primary authors of the committee’s research — Dr. Casson and the co-chairman David Viano of Wayne State University, and Dr. Elliot Pellman, the Jets’ team physician — were present. When asked why Dr. Casson was not present to testify, Mr. Goodell said the committee did not request him. Mr. Conyers disputed that, and an aide for Mr. Goodell handed him a note that led Mr. Goodell to say he would get back to the committee to clarify his answer. Ms. Sánchez and Representative Anthony D. Weiner, Democrat of New York, criticized the N.F.L. committee’s continuing brain study of retired players. Independent experts have warned that the study could have negative effects on youth sports if conclusions of few risks are improperly derived. Mr. Weiner said, “Wouldn’t it be perhaps most wise to put the brakes” on the study, and “start from scratch to try to get this right?” “This is a worker safety thing — no different than if someone was coming off the assembly line at a production plant and 20 years later, they all had arthritis in their right knee,” he added. “We’d look at it the exact same way.” Mr. Goodell responded: “We want you to have confidence in the study. That’s one of the reasons for 15 years we’ve been involved in this issue. We have published every piece of data in the N.F.L. We have published it publicly, we have given it to medical journals, it has been part of peer review. We don’t control those doctors. They are medical professionals. They’re scientists. They do this for a living.” Mr. Smith, of the players union, was also criticized for its sluggishness in addressing the issue of concussion risks years ago and for not better educating its players. “We will do better,” Mr. Smith said. He and Mr. Goodell were warned not to allow players’ health care to become embroiled in contract negotiations. Mr. Conyers repeatedly pressed Mr. Smith and Mr. Goodell to turn over all medical records to Congress for independent review, and they agreed to do so. However, in an interview after his testimony, Mr. Goodell said he had agreed to turn over league studies and research that had already been released, not player medical records. Turning over such records, he said, could cause confidentiality conflicts, and “there’s going to be a lot of issues.” “Whatever the committee asks — that we can do — we will,” he said. Ms. Sánchez, in a subsequent interview, said: “Unfortunately, I didn’t find him to be a very helpful witness. He was really vague on certain things and didn’t know the answers to certain things. The committee had requested that Dr. Casson be there to be able to answer questions like that, and obviously he was a no-show.” Although the hearing’s most contentious portions involved the N.F.L., a consensus emerged that how the N.F.L. and its players handle the issue of brain-injury management will, however indirectly, influence behavior on the youth and high school level. Representative Dan Lungren, Republican of California, said the N.F.L. and its media partners had to discourage the celebration of overly violent play. Representative Mike Quigley, Democrat of Illinois, said that although Congress focused mostly on N.F.L. policies on Wednesday, “the norms of the N.F.L., for better or worse, become the norms of high school football players.”",

    "source": "Worried Auto Industry Braces for Change Under Trump <eos> DETROIT — First the Obama administration bailed out much of the American auto industry, pulling it out of a tailspin. Then it reshaped the business, with regulations and policies intended to increase fuel economy, improve safety and add jobs. Now, under President-elect Donald J. Trump, the industry is bracing for another wholesale makeover. Perhaps no industry could be affected in more ways by the new administration than the auto business. That became all the more apparent this week, with Mr. Trump’s selection of Scott Pruitt — the Oklahoma attorney general who is a climate-change skeptic and close ally of the oil and gas industry — to run the Environmental Protection Agency . The changes under the Trump administration could include possible tariffs that will raise prices on imported vehicles and parts, fewer subsidies for electric cars and policies that discourage automakers from moving products from American factories to Mexico. And any scaling back of fuel-economy goals by the Trump administration, if Mr. Pruitt’s climate change skepticism and embrace of fossil fuels translates to policy, could also influence the types of vehicles the industry plans to build in coming years — and where it builds them. Bigger models like sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks are less fuel-efficient than cars but more profitable for automakers. And their steeper price tags can help pay for the higher labor costs of making them in the United States. In a move that underscored the new psychology since Mr. Trump’s election, Ford Motor — which had been a target of his criticism — in mid-November decided to keep building a Lincoln S.U.V. in Kentucky rather than Mexico. And yet, for a capital-intensive industry that routinely makes billion dollar bets on new factories and products, the uncertainty is unnerving. “Our membership is just perplexed right now,” said Gloria Bergquist, vice president for public affairs for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents a dozen carmakers, including General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota, on safety and environmental issues. “This is all uncharted territory.” Mr. Trump’s campaign was studded with promises that could upend the status quo, including some to relax policies intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. He has yet to detail any coming changes. But pursuing policies similar to those he promoted in his campaign could change the entire manufacturing industry by penalizing companies for investing overseas or by stifling free-flowing global trade. Mr. Trump has yet to specify changes he might make to Nafta or other industrial policies. But his cabinet appointments, particularly the selection for commerce secretary of the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr. , who has suggested that he is receptive to some of the antitrade views favored by Mr. Trump, indicate that the incoming president may take an aggressive approach to modifying trade deals and other tenets of the outgoing Obama administration. One industry analyst, Ron Harbour of the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, said many voters in Rust Belt states like Michigan and Ohio backed Mr. Trump primarily because of his promises to restore manufacturing jobs in the United States. “So there probably will be pressure to do something,” Mr. Harbour said. “And if he doesn’t do anything, they probably are not going to be too thrilled.” Mr. Trump will inherit an auto industry that is far healthier than when President Obama took office and industry officials could push back strongly on disruptive changes. But auto executives generally support Mr. Trump’s choice of a former labor secretary in the George W. Bush administration, Elaine Chao — who is also the wife of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell — to head the Transportation Department. The department oversees fuel-economy and safety rules that affect the types of vehicles that automakers produce. “We all have a common interest, and that is to maximize the rate of innovation in the technologies that save lives, avoid crashes and improve fuel economy,” the auto alliance said in response to Ms. Chao’s appointment. No change would be more consequential to the auto industry than applying steep tariffs on imports from Mexico and elsewhere. Companies could be forced to radically change how and where they get commodity parts, the production of which has been migrating to low-wage nations for decades. Consumers could see a change in the types of cars available. Despite Mr. Trump’s campaign rhetoric, the American automotive industry and auto jobs have been buoyant since the Obama administration’s bailout. Since 2010, vehicle production has doubled in the United States, and hundreds of thousands of workers have been hired. Last year, a record 17.4 million cars and trucks were sold in the United States, and analysts forecast strong demand for several years. “You have record levels of production and record levels of demand,” said Mike Jackson of the research firm IHS Markit. “There is every reason for the industry to emphasize that it’s in a very strong position.” Still, the industry is anticipating changes from Mr. Trump. Ford, the nation’s second-largest automaker after General Motors, uncharacteristically made public a decision to keep production of the Lincoln S.U.V. in Kentucky, after Mr. Trump had singled out the company for its growing investments in Mexico. Ford, like G.M., Fiat Chrysler and nearly every foreign automaker, has a huge stake in protecting the interlocking network of factories and parts suppliers made possible by Nafta. Plants in Mexico are crucial to meeting surging demand for new vehicles in the United States. Beyond that, automakers have already committed big investments to new plants in Mexico to take advantage of its cheaper labor and export-friendly trade agreements. While Mr. Trump has yet to specify how he would renegotiate Nafta, his emphasis has been on increasing American jobs and discouraging automakers from using foreign plants to supply the American market. His proposal to put tariffs of as much as 35 percent on vehicles imported from Mexico has stunned auto executives who have built their business models on open borders for cars, trucks and the thousands of parts in them. “A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,” said Mark Fields, chief executive of Ford. Imported vehicles are an integral part of the American market and account for more than 40 percent of its annual volume. Last year, about eight million cars, trucks and sport utilities sold in the United States were built elsewhere, primarily in Mexico, Canada, Japan and Korea. Nearly all of them enter the market free of tariffs that would increase sticker prices significantly. Increasing the price of an imported vehicle with tariffs could reduce overall vehicle sales and exert economic pressure on manufacturers as well as on freight haulers, dealerships and independent service centers. And if Mr. Trump chooses to impose tariffs on auto parts produced abroad and shipped to plants in the United States, the impact will spread further. Last year, auto parts worth $143 billion were imported into the United States, about 35 percent of them from Mexico, compared with $81 billion in parts that were exported, according to the Commerce Department. Many big suppliers, however, are global and make parts in every region of the world. The parts industry’s largest American trade group, the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, said its member companies employed more than 734,000 workers in the United States, and generated another 2.9 million jobs in related businesses. The industry is acutely sensitive to changes in trade policies that could have a ripple effect on its ability to ship parts in and out of the country. And like automakers, parts manufacturers are anxious to know what Mr. Trump has in store for them. “Now that the election is over, we can begin to explore what to expect in the months to come,” the trade group’s president, Steve Handschuh, wrote in a letter to its members, adding that he was eager “to express our priorities” to the Trump transition team. In addition to Mr. Trump’s focus on trade issues, the industry is expecting policies that diverge from the Obama administration’s enthusiastic support of electric cars, including the $7,500 tax credits that encouraged consumers to buy them, and for the testing and development of self-driving vehicles. In a Nov. 10 letter to the Trump transition team, the auto alliance asked for clarity on policy changes as soon as possible. “Auto manufacturing is a highly capital-intensive business, and because of that we rely on long-term certainty,” Ms. Bergquist wrote. Yet the industry has proved to be adaptable to shifts in government, whether by building more fuel-efficient vehicles to meet new regulations, or increasing investments in Mexico because of Nafta. It is also more focused on self-interest than politics. In its eight-page letter, the auto alliance laid out several goals — including repeating its position that the government re-evaluate its timetable for automakers to achieve fleetwide fuel economy of 54.5 miles a gallon. But while the letter was perceived as tailored to Mr. Trump’s agenda, Ms. Bergquist said it was composed before the election and would have been sent to an incoming Clinton administration had the outcome been different. “Our position was the same, no matter who won,” she said.",

    "source": "Mali Coup Leaders Struggle to Assert Control <eos> DAKAR, Senegal — Residents of Bamako, the capital of Mali , waited in tension and uncertainty on Saturday for the outcome of a military coup d’état that overthrew the country’s elected government last week, ending more than 20 years of democracy in the nation. Regional analysts and residents said little appeared to be resolved as junta leaders struggled to maintain control amid increasing international isolation and persistent rumors of an imminent countercoup. State television, seized early on by the coup leaders, went off the air for an hour on Friday night as soldiers set up barricades around the downtown building housing it. Later, Capt. Amadou Haya Sanogo, the coup leader who had received military training in the United States, appeared briefly to assure viewers of his “good health,” followed by repeated declarations of support for the junta from young people and other backers, many using the same language. Speaking of the countercoup rumors, a military spokesman, Col. Idrissa Traore, said Saturday that there was “nothing serious in all that.” Yet the announcement that the junta remained in control was hardly seen as definitive by observers. “The situation is very fluid,” said Dr. Abdel Fatau Musah, a senior official with the regional grouping of West African states, Ecowas , who left Bamako on Saturday morning. “Nobody knows what is going to happen.” Ecowas, which has condemned the coup, scheduled an emergency meeting of regional leaders for Tuesday in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The whereabouts of Mali’s elected president, Amadou Toumani Touré, remained unknown. “There is a lot of insecurity,” Dr. Musah said. “It’s going to be very difficult to see how this junta is going to survive. “The country has run out of resources.” Mali’s air and land borders have been sealed since late Wednesday; food, fuel and cash are all running low; banks are closed, as are many stores.” Dr. Musah added: “The junta is made up of very young officers, very inexperienced. Ecowas wants them to quickly surrender.” Opposition politicians in Mali continued to criticize the coup. “With just weeks before an election in which the Malian people were getting ready to freely and democratically decide their future, nobody has the right to substitute themselves by force to popular will,” Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, a former prime minister, said in a statement. Mali, heavily dependent on aid, risks a near-total cutoff of foreign assistance. “Any U.S. assistance to the government of Mali beyond what we give for humanitarian purposes is at risk,” Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, said Friday. That point was relayed directly to Captain Sanogo by an official at the American Embassy in Bamako, the State Department said.",

    "source": "North Korea Is Ready to Discuss Aid From Seoul <eos> SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Monday that it was ready to discuss humanitarian aid from the South to alleviate damage caused by flooding and typhoons. The South Korean Red Cross Society first offered aid a week ago. On Monday, its North Korean counterpart said it wanted to know what the South planned to offer and how much, the South’s Unification Ministry said in a statement. South Korea’s offer and the North’s response raised the possibility of the two governments resuming dialogue after years of tension. The North has repeatedly refused contact with President Lee Myung-bak’s government in the South. The relations between the two Koreas have been chilly since Mr. Lee came to power in 2008 and cut off large shipments of aid unless North Korea took concrete steps toward dismantling its nuclear weapons program. Ties were further strained after North Korea shelled a South Korean island in 2010. In the same year, the North was also accused of sinking a South Korean Navy ship, killing 46 sailors. When South Korea offered aid for North Korean children worth 5 billion won ($4.4 million) last year, the North called the proposal too small. It demanded a large shipment of cement, grain and construction equipment, and the talks broke down. The South Korean government said on Monday that it would continue to exchange letters with the North to see if it was willing to negotiate a formal aid agreement. More than 200 North Koreans have been killed and large tracts of farmland have been destroyed by flooding and typhoons since June, according to North Korean media. Tens of thousands of people have lost their homes. In June, the United Nations appealed for $198 million in humanitarian aid for North Korea, saying that two-thirds of the country’s 22 million people continued to suffer from chronic food shortages. The North’s nuclear and missile programs and its military provocations have helped scuttle aid shipments from potential donor countries, including South Korea.",

    "source": "Google Faces New Round of Antitrust Charges in Europe <eos> When it comes to Europe’s lengthy investigations into Google, Margrethe Vestager, the region’s competition chief, is hoping that the third time’s a charm. Ms. Vestager announced on Thursday a new round of antitrust charges against the company — the third set since early 2015 — claiming that some of the company’s advertising products had restricted consumer choice. The efforts are part of her continuing push to rein in Google’s activities in the European Union, where the Silicon Valley company has captured roughly 90 percent of the region’s online search market. “Google’s conduct, based on our evidence, is harmful to consumers,” Ms. Vestager told reporters in Brussels on Thursday. “Google’s magnificent innovations don’t give it the right to deny competitors the chance to innovate.” The announcement represents a setback for Google, which vigorously denied any wrongdoing in two previous European antitrust charges linked to Android , its popular mobile operating system, and some of its dominant online search services . It also comes at a difficult time for Europe’s competition authorities, which have been unable to land a knockout punch against Google’s perceived abusive activities in the region, despite investigations that date back to 2010. The stakes are high. Google could face fines of up to 10 percent, or about $7 billion, of its global annual revenue if it is found to have broken Europe’s tough competition rules. For months, both sides have been jockeying for position, with Google already filing lengthy legal arguments about why it believes its European activities are lawful. Ms. Vestager’s antitrust charges are just one of a number of regulatory challenges to Google’s activities in Europe, ranging from tax investigations in France and Spain to concerns that Google does not fully protect people’s online privacy rights. The company denies any wrongdoing. Other Silicon Valley technology companies, including Amazon, Apple and Facebook, have also faced regulatory investigations in Europe, raising questions over whether the region’s lawmakers are specifically focusing on these American giants , which have come to dominate much of the digital world. European officials deny any such bias. Google said in a statement on Thursday that it would provide a detailed response to Europe’s latest charges, but it added, “We believe our innovations and product improvements have increased choice for E.U. consumers and promote competition.” The company has until the fall to respond. How Europe Is Going After Apple, Google and Other U.S. Tech Giants The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with — pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world. American competition officials have also reviewed claims that Google abused its market position to favor its services over those of rivals, though the Federal Trade Commission has yet to find any violations. Europe’s new antitrust charges represent a further ratcheting up of the region’s often frosty relationship with Google. In particular, European antitrust officials are taking aim at some of the company’s online advertising tools — the main engine for Google’s $75 billion in annual revenue. They say that the company may have abused its dominant market position when offering some of its search products on third-party companies’ websites. These businesses — including publishers and online retailers — can use Google’s search engine on their sites so that people can find information like newspaper articles or promotions. Such agreements with third-party companies, which date to 2006, also include showing paid-for advertising next to search results, often provided by Google. Ms. Vestager said on Thursday that the technology company may have abused its dominance — it holds roughly an 80 percent market share in this type of niche on-site search — by forcing companies to sign onerous contracts that limited competition and reduced consumer choice. Since 2009, Google has made it easier for advertising rivals to show their offerings alongside its services. But Europe’s competition chief said that Google still required third-party companies to show a minimum number of Google-provided ads on their site. The Silicon Valley company also requires businesses using the service to ask for approval on where some rivals’ ads may be shown on their websites. “All these restrictions allowed Google to protect its market share and stifle competition,” Ms. Vestager said. Europe’s antitrust authorities have also doubled down on a previous competition charge, announced last year, which claimed that Google had diverted traffic from competitors in favor of its own comparison-shopping site. On Thursday, Ms. Vestager said her team had found new evidence to buttress their claims, adding that because of Google’s actions, European consumers may not have access to the most relevant search results when looking online for goods and services. Yet when asked about the failure of European antitrust authorities to order fines or changes to the way Google does business, despite several years of investigations, Ms. Vestager said she aimed to ensure the charges against the company stood up in European courts. “Speed is of the essence,” but “the other side of that coin is quality,” Ms. Vestager said on Thursday. “Sometimes that kind of quality comes at the cost of speed.”",

    "source": "Gas Deal in Europe Is Undone and Redone <eos> MOSCOW — A European Union-brokered deal between Russia and Ukraine to restore the flow of heating fuel to the Continent seemed to be falling apart Sunday evening, less than a day after it had been signed, with Moscow objecting to conditions that Ukraine attached to the agreement after Russia had already signed it. In what appeared to be a first step toward resolving a dispute that has cut off about one-fifth of the natural gas used in Europe, at the peak of the winter heating season, the governments of Russia and Ukraine and the European Union agreed to establish independent monitors of pipelines that carry Russian gas to the west. The protocol was a precondition set by Russian energy officials to turn on the gas flow again. Russia shut off the valves on Tuesday after an extended dispute with Ukraine over pricing and accusations of stealing gas from the export pipelines. In a flurry of shuttle diplomacy over the weekend, the Czech prime minister, Mirek Topolanek, secured the signature of Russia’s prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin, in Moscow and then flew to Kiev, where Ukraine’s prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, also signed the agreement. Yet by late Sunday, the off-again-on-again deal appeared to be off again. Russia’s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying he would not honor the pact. At issue was a handwritten phrase that Ms. Tymoshenko wrote beside her signature early Sunday morning, after the document had already been signed by Mr. Putin. In English, she wrote, “with declaration attached.” Ms. Tymoshenko’s declaration, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, said that Ukraine had not been guilty of stealing gas from the export pipelines, a statement essentially asking Moscow to backpedal on the allegation that had underpinned its justification for halting shipments to Europe. Heading into Monday, the prospects for a deal were marked by confusion and uncertainty. Bloomberg News reported that a European Union official had said that Ukraine had agreed to sign a new version of the accord to authorize the monitoring of the pipelines, paving the way to resume gas shipments. The report said that the new deal came after a phone call between Mr. Putin and the European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, and would be separate from Ms. Tymoshenko’s declaration. “Barroso has spoken to Tymoshenko, and they have agreed to separate the two documents,” Ferran Tarradellas Espuny, a commission spokesman, said in Brussels, according to the report. “On one side the declaration, and on the other side the terms of reference.” The declaration from Ms. Tymoshenko also demanded that Russia, if it wanted to export gas to Europe across Ukraine, provide fuel to operate pumping stations along the pipeline route. Russia has refused to do that, saying it is Ukraine’s obligation as the country responsible for transit. The Russian authorities quickly said this rendered the agreement void. Mr. Medvedev blamed Ukraine for collapsing the deal and sharply criticized the Ukrainian addendum. “I instruct the government not to use the document that was signed yesterday,” he said. “These clauses and annexes are a mockery of common sense and an offense against the agreements that were reached earlier,” Mr. Medvedev said in comments published by the Interfax news agency. “These actions are seeking to destroy the existing agreements on the control over the gas transit; they have an expressed provocative and destructive nature.” Mr. Putin, in a phone call on Sunday to Mr. Barroso, said Russia would not accept conditions added after he had signed the protocol, Interfax reported. Seeking to sooth Russian concerns, Mr. Topolanek called Mr. Putin to say that Ms. Tymoshenko’s declaration was not binding. Later Sunday, Mr. Barroso said Ms. Tymoshenko had agreed to address Russian concerns over her statement with the goal of restoring gas flows to Europe, Reuters reported. A spokesman for Gazprom , the Russian gas monopoly, said the company’s chief executive, Aleksei B. Miller, would fly to Brussels on Monday to continue negotiations. Even once an agreement is in place, it may be days before relief comes to European countries down the line from Ukraine, especially Poland and Bulgaria, which have suffered greatly without heating fuel in the bitter winter weather. If Russia immediately turned on the flow, it would take about three days to repressurize the European natural gas pipeline system and restore full service, experts said. And the underlying price dispute has still not been resolved. The Russian authorities maintain that Ukraine began siphoning from pipelines some of the Russian natural gas intended for export to Europe and has been using it to meet internal demand since Russia halted supplies to Ukraine on Jan. 1 because of a dispute over pricing.",

    "source": "Moscow Mayor Pokes Kremlin. (Cue Hornets.) <eos> MOSCOW — Of all the high priests of Russian officialdom, few have become more deeply entrenched in power than Moscow’s mayor, Yuri M. Luzhkov . He has ruled this city often like a fief for nearly two decades, transforming it from a Soviet wreck into a shimmering metropolis. Barrel-chested and bald, with a proletarian’s peaked cap, he has seemingly been above reproach for years, despite numerous allegations of corruption even as his wife, a real estate developer, has become Russia’s richest woman. But a slight jab at President, Dmitri A. Medvedev could now bring the mayor’s once inviolable authority to ruin. In a recent article, Mr. Luzhkov appeared to criticize the president for indecisiveness, while seeming to call for his predecessor, Vladimir V. Putin, now prime minister, to return to the presidency. The article touched off the biggest political quarrel Russia has seen in nearly a decade, raising new speculation about the relationship between Russia’s two leaders. It has also prompted an all-out attack by the Kremlin-controlled news media against the mayor, which many analysts here say could presage the end of his 18-year reign. “He intended to try to push a wedge between Medvedev and Putin,” said Gleb O. Pavlovsky, a political consultant who advises the Kremlin. “This is already an intolerable situation for the federal center, so I think Luzhkov will have to leave.” It is an unexpected battle in a country that has long appeared drained of public political life, pitting Russia’s young president — an avid blogger with a fondness for gadgets — against a man who has been a part of the political elite of Moscow since it was still the capital of the Soviet Union. The fight has at turns resembled an old-time Politburo power struggle and an election for student government. This week, Russian political pundits scrambled over the news that Mr. Medvedev, 45, had snubbed Mr. Luzhkov, offering no public congratulations to the mayor on the occasion of his 74th birthday. It could have been the latest sign that the mayor was on his way out. But who knows? Mr. Putin praised him in a birthday telegram as a “competent and experienced professional.” This is Russian politics, a game of interpreting winks and gestures, of listening for murmurs in the dark corridors of power. It is an art that today differs little from the days when Kremlinologists guessed the fortune or failure of a Soviet leader by his place at the May Day parade. What is more or less certain is that Mr. Medvedev wants Mr. Luzhkov gone. When asked about the mayor in a closed meeting with Russian newspaper editors this summer, Mr. Medvedev shocked attendees by referring to the mayor with a vulgarism, a person at the meeting said. Since becoming president in 2008, Mr. Medvedev has eliminated most of the old regional bosses, usually by offering them other jobs or retirement deals, but Mr. Luzhkov is different. “Here, we do not fire anyone, we simply buy them off,” said Georgi A. Satarov, the president of the Indem Foundation, a policy research group focusing on corruption. “But it is hard to buy off Luzhkov because he is very expensive.” Whatever has gone on behind closed doors over the past few weeks, if there was an attempt to make Mr. Luzhkov walk away quietly, experts say, it seems to have failed. In Mr. Luzhkov’s article , published in the official newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta, the mayor criticized Mr. Medvedev’s rare decision to bow to public pressure to halt construction of a highway between Moscow and St. Petersburg, suggesting that such hesitation to press ahead with development projects undermined trust in the government. He called for the return of “true meaning and authority to the Russian government.” The response was swift and brutal. Days after the article was published, the government-owned NTV television station broadcast “The Cap Affair,” named for the mayor’s trademark peaked hat. The film, crudely produced and set to ominous-sounding music, was extraordinary by the typically bland standards of official television here, raising uncomfortable questions about Moscow’s crumbling transportation infrastructure and the astounding wealth of Mr. Luzhkov’s billionaire wife, Yelena Baturina. It also criticized Mr. Luzhkov for taking a vacation in Austria this summer as Muscovites choked on noxious fumes from peat bog fires during a record heat wave, and said the mayor, an avid beekeeper, returned to Moscow only to save his hives. The documentary was followed by programs on other government channels, which accused Mr. Luzhkov of, among other things, complicity in the evictions of Muscovites from their homes to make way for his wife’s development projects. The accusations are nothing new. For years, opposition groups have made the same claims — and have faced lawsuits and even brief prison sentences for doing so. Mr. Luzhkov, who left for Austria once again this week, has vowed to file lawsuits against the government channels responsible for the recent documentaries and has refused to respond to allegations made in them. “To make justifications is the wrong way to defend yourself in Russia,” he told REN-TV television, a quasi-independent channel, last week. “If a person starts to justify himself it appears that he is nevertheless guilty.” Guilty or not, few here believe that corruption or other misdeeds prompted the recent attacks. None of the documentaries mention that Mr. Luzhkov is a leading member of Mr. Putin’s party or that the mayor serves at the pleasure of the president, who has the power to appoint and remove regional leaders at will. “In a democratic country there would just be elections,” said Viktor A. Shenderovich, a satirical political writer, who has criticized the mayor for years. “But all this is happening not in a democratic country, but in Byzantium. Luzhkov is being removed not because he stole or was corrupt, but because he has gotten caught between two clans.” Ms. Baturina, the mayor’s wife, explained the campaign against her husband as part of a conflict about whether Mr. Medvedev or Mr. Putin would run for president in elections scheduled for 2012. “As the elections approach, there are people in the presidential administration who are afraid that the mayor will support not President Medvedev, but Prime Minister Putin,” she said in an interview with the Russian news magazine, The New Times, published this week. There is little evidence to suggest any conflict between Russia’s two leaders, and both have consistently brushed aside questions about their plans for 2012. Even the conflict over the mayor has elicited nary a public word from the nation’s top two leaders. Mr. Medvedev has only hinted at his displeasure with Mr. Luzhkov, leaving anonymous Kremlin sources to whisper confirmation of the mayor’s impending demise in the ears of reporters.",

    "source": "No Bluster as Christie Moves From Scandal to His Agenda <eos> Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, scrambling to regain his political footing, delivered a high-stakes State of the State address on Tuesday that mixed arms-length expressions of contrition, a defiant assertion that his troubles are no excuse for inaction and a jarringly timed demand for bipartisanship. But there was little sign that his administration’s widening scandal over lane closings at the George Washington Bridge was abating. Two new legislative committees readied plans to issue a fresh batch of subpoenas for Mr. Christie’s aides, a photo surfaced showing that the governor had been in close contact with an appointee at the center of the controversy, and state Democratic Party officials mocked him with a new video that asked: “The State of the State? Embarrassed.” The closely watched speech was a stark break, in content, tone and reaction, from the powerful and brash figure to which Trenton is accustomed. Just one year ago, Mr. Christie, a Republican, basked in adulation and gratitude for soothing residents of New Jersey’s hurricane-battered shoreline — even fist-bumping the Democratic State Senate president on his way in to the chamber. This time, Mr. Christie, known for his firm command over the state’s politics and an unrivaled agility on stage, seemed somewhat diminished. The applause was shorter and less rapturous. His boastful style was tamped down. And instead of marveling, over and over, at how the country was looking to New Jersey, he emphasized a long list of local meat-and-potato policy plans: improving schools, reducing crime and cutting pension costs. There was no fist-bumping. (Mr. Christie instead shook the Senate president’s hand.) State Senator Linda R. Greenstein, a Democrat, said afterward that she had detected a “lack of confidence, which you could never see before.” She called his performance “not as bold as usual.” Mr. Christie, 51, tackled the lane closing controversy in the first moments of his speech , falling back on a careful and familiar-sounding phrase, “mistakes were clearly made.” But he sought to assure state residents that, despite the many revelations of the past week, the conduct of those close to him “does not define us or our state.” The governor, whose resounding electoral victories in a largely Democratic state have made him a potential White House contender, repeatedly invoked a favored theme: the necessity of reaching across the political aisle to find legislative compromise. Image Gov. Chris Christie walked the aisles after he delivered his State of the State address in Trenton on Tuesday. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times His voice rising, he ticked off a list of his accomplishments that had hinged on significant support from Democratic lawmakers (four balanced budgets, pension reform, private-sector job growth), affixing a favored slogan at the end of each. “Passed with bipartisan support,” he kept saying. “We acted, and we acted together,” Mr. Christie said. The governor, who has been teased for uttering the word I, or a variation of it, more than 800 times during a largely lauded news conference last Thursday, took pains to revise his self-referential vocabulary. In his State of the State address, he used the word “we” or “we’ve” 97 times. He called upon the Legislature to push for wide-ranging changes to the state’s education system, crime-fighting strategy and budgeting process, most in keeping with his moderate brand of Northeast Republicanism. He proposed longer school days and school years, proposals whose popularity has grown in urban school districts. “Life in 2014 demands something more for our students,” he said. In the kind of gesture that has long distinguished him from peers in his party, Mr. Christie pointedly reached out to two of the state’s most troubled cities, Newark and Camden, both bastions of Democratic politics. He reserved his greatest outrage for the poor showing among Camden’s high school seniors, bemoaning that, across the entire city, only three students graduated “college ready” last year. “That is obscene,” he said, “and a breaching of the faith between those families and every level of government responsible for their education.” Mr. Christie at times cast himself as a law-and-order governor. Evoking a deadly carjacking a few weeks ago at the Mall at Short Hills in Millburn, N.J., he called for the Legislature to revise laws so that criminals who are deemed a threat to the public safety can be held without bail, as is allowed in the federal system. But in a 45-minute speech that expounded on his plans for a second term, which starts next week, Mr. Christie devoted just a few minutes to the investigation that is buffeting his administration and increasingly complicating his role as a national Republican leader. Image During his speech, Mr. Christie hugged Craig Hanlon, a former teenage drug addict who got treatment and went on to receive a law degree before working for Mr. Christie when he was United States attorney. Credit Mel Evans/Associated Press On Tuesday, questions arose about a photo, published by The Wall Street Journal , that captured Mr. Christie standing with David Wildstein, a Christie loyalist and a key figure in the bridge scandal, on the third day of the lane closings that snarled traffic in Fort Lee, N.J., for four days in September. Mr. Christie, when previously asked about his relationship with Mr. Wildstein, said the two were rarely in contact. On Tuesday night, Mr. Christie’s office said the picture was from a Sept. 11 ceremony that Mr. Christie has attended each year since he took office. “They were all there for one reason — to pay tribute to the heroes of 9/11,” said Colin Reed, a spokesman for the governor. In the State House, there were growing signs of a changed political landscape. The two Democratic lawmakers who have heavily criticized the administration’s handling of the lane closings, Senator Loretta Weinberg and Assemblyman John Wisniewski, reveled in their newfound fame, posing for photographs before the State of the State speech. And as Mr. Christie spoke, the room was less than rapt at times: A few lawmakers took out their iPhones and BlackBerrys, apparently to check email, as he talked. Several in the audience took note of what they said was Mr. Christie’s chastened language, observing his mentions of rehabilitation, recovery and making choices, and wondering if they contained a double meaning for him and his staff. Mr. Christie may not have projected his usual swagger, but he did manage to deliver the kind of raw emotion that has defined his public life. Toward the end of his speech, as he laid out a plan for a new drug rehabilitation program, he asked a man in the audience to stand up. It was a former teenage addict who, after receiving treatment, sobered up, received a law degree and landed a job working for Mr. Christie when he was United States attorney for New Jersey. As the man, Craig Hanlon, rose, and Mr. Christie left the podium to embrace him, the crowd offered its biggest and fullest ovation of the afternoon. Mr. Christie concluded with a philosophical quotation about the future — his state’s, as well, it seemed, as his own. “ ‘Choice, not chance, determines your destiny,’ ” he said. “Our future is not set — it, too, is the product of the choices we make from this day forward. So let us choose wisely.”",

    "source": "Online Stores Are Weaning Shoppers Off Sales <eos> This holiday season, online sales are zooming, even as online retailers offer fewer discounts and turn picky about who shops at their sites. After two years of relative malaise, online sales grew 12 percent in the first 47 days of the holiday season, according to comScore , to $27.5 billion. That significantly outpaces the growth rate of retail sales over all, which analysts expect to rise 3 to 4 percent this holiday season. But online retailers are now protecting their margins with careful offers, dispensing with the promotions of the last two holiday seasons that were meant to drive sales and get rid of extra inventory. Gone are the coupons that give shoppers 40 percent off all purchases. Instead, offers go to selected customers, and are specialized: a discount on wool jackets, free hoop earrings when people spend $100, a “mystery” discount amount that is revealed only at checkout. The promotions try to get customers to behave in a certain way. A coupon may seem straightforward, like Drugstore.com offering $5 off a $30 purchase. In fact, it is encouraging one-time customers to browse through several pages of a site and get to know what a retailer offers as they decide what to buy. “The reason there’s these different promotions and not just the straight dollar-off or percent-off promotions all the time is there are different incentives,” said David Lonczak, chief marketing officer of Drugstore.com. “You may just need a sale, you may have a product you’re long on and you need to get rid of it, or you may be looking to acquire customers with a higher basket,” he said, referring to the transaction price. “You have to be thoughtful.” Discounting has declined; in November, retailers’ e-commerce revenue from sales of full-price items rose 52 percent versus November 2009, according to MyBuys , which works on personalization offers for retailers. But less discounting has not tamped down online sales. On Thanksgiving weekend , more than one-third of purchases were made online, versus about 28.5 percent last year, according to the National Retail Federation. That is because even staunch in-store shoppers are now comfortable buying online, said Fiona Dias, executive vice president for strategy and marketing for GSI Commerce, which provides e-commerce technology to retailers like Toys “R” Us. And the high demand means that online retailers do not have to slash prices to get customers. “If anything, we’re running tight on inventory because everyone has sold a lot more than they expected to,” Ms. Dias said of the sites she works with. “That’s why we’re not seeing 50-percent-off promotions.” Given their strong position, retailers are trying to get customers out of the price-wars mind-set that they adopted during the recession. “At some point, we have to stop and try to go back to where we were because if everyone continues to offer 20 percent, 50 percent off, it’s going to change the market on a long-term scale that it would be too hard to get back from,” said Melissa Joy Manning, who runs an online jewelry store bearing her name. She has stopped discounting, but is giving a pair of silver hoop earrings to customers who spend $100 or more. “We don’t have unlimited resources, so we do try to be as creative with them as we can,” she said. Like Ms. Manning, other retailers are getting creative with unusually specific offers. “It’s about margins,” said Andy Dunn, the chief executive and co-founder of Bonobos, a men’s clothing site. While last December, about a third of his revenue came from promotions, this year it’s down to about a quarter, even as he expects his revenue to nearly triple for the month. “There’s less of a need to be highly promotional,” he said. “At the same time, we feel we need to get better at the laser-beam promoting.” So he is whittling down offers, sending, for instance, a 20 percent offer on suit elements to people who have bought wool pants but not a jacket. “We don’t have to treat everyone the same,” he said. Drugstore.com also changes its approach depending on the customer. That offer for $5 off any purchase over $30 may prompt people to explore the site. “So if a new Drugstore.com customer doesn’t know I sell toys and games, would you think I’d sell a Razor scooter?” he said. “I have to incent you to shop around.” He would use a percent-off coupon, he said, when he wants to drive overall sales. And he tends to avoid offers like “$10 off your purchase,” because “I would get a whole bunch of people coming in, they would find the product that was 10 dollars and one cent, they would get it and I would never see them again,” he said. Other retailers are trying to stand out in crowded in-boxes. Bloomingdales.com had a “mystery savings” event last week, in which customers on its e-mail list were sent a code that called up discounts of between 10 and 40 percent at checkout. “People are going, ‘Well, maybe I’m going to be the one who hits the jackpot,’ ” said Bruce Berman, president of Bloomingdales.com and chief financial officer of Bloomingdale’s. “So they open it at a higher rate.” The tactic helped the store stand out, he said. The day after the Bloomingdale’s e-mail went out, Saks Fifth Avenue also sent one promoting a “mystery sale” online. Saks declined to comment on the promotion. For Bloomingdale’s, Mr. Berman said, “It worked out to our advantage because whoever shops both will say, ‘I already did that.’ ” Sometimes, a retailer can be too successful with an online sale, and have to shift tactics on the fly to keep profit up. At the Gap Inc. sites, which include Banana Republic and Old Navy, the plan was to do heavy discounts on the four days after Thanksgiving . But Friday sales “exceeded our forecast — it was too hot, it was too strong,” said Toby Lenk, the president of Gap Inc. Direct. “So we pulled back on our promotions for Cyber Monday.” And other retailers have had to devise new tactics after vendors instructed them to stop offering discounts on their brands. “With the discounting in the last years, the perception from our vendors is that we were discounting their products,” said Pete LaBore, director of customer retention at Backcountry.com . So the company came up with a new offer — “on our dime,” Mr. LaBore said — that gave $20 off on the site. “It’s totally free money,” the offer said. But customers did not seem to believe it, and Backcountry.com sent another e-mail two days later with the subject line, “Seriously — It’s Free.” The offer went only to people who had bought, in the past, certain brands or categories in which Backcountry.com now had too much stock, or to people who usually spent enough that “we weren’t just going to have somebody coming in buying a three-dollar pair of socks,” Mr. LaBore said. It seemed a smart approach; so far, the offer has been profitable, with most people spending much more than $20, Mr. LaBore said. “We’re trying to get away from the ‘sale, sale, sale’ message, and this is a different way to do that,” he said.",

    "source": "Otto Beisheim, German Retailing Pioneer, Dead at 89 <eos> BERLIN — Otto Beisheim, who revolutionized retailing in postwar Germany by introducing the concept of selling wholesale goods directly to customers and the builder of the country’s largest retailer, Metro, was found dead on Monday at his home in Bavaria. He was 89. Mr. Beisheim, who had been suffering from an incurable illness, committed suicide, his foundation, the Otto-Beisheim Group, said. Mr. Beisheim, who was said to have amassed a fortune of $3.3 billion, was intensely private and rarely in the public eye. Even at his company’s shareholders’ meetings, he was reported to have shown up on occasion masquerading under the name Müller. Mr. Beisheim founded Metro in 1964 and continued to hold a 10 percent stake. It is now the third-largest retailer in Europe, behind Carrefour of France and Tesco of Britain. Like Sam’s Clubs and Costco in the United States, Metro stores sell only to members. But Metro members are mostly businesses or professionals. The son of a caretaker, Mr. Beisheim was born on Jan 3, 1924, near Essen, Germany. His family was too poor to pay for him to attend high school, so he became a leather tradesman. As a wealthy man, he later donated widely to schools and universities. The best known of these, a business school near Koblenz, carries his name: the WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management. Image Otto Beisheim in 2004. Credit Tim Brakemeier/DPA, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images During World War II Mr. Beisheim was a radio controller in the Waffen-SS, the armed wing of the Nazi Party. His military service became known publicly only in 2006, and some said a wish to hide his past may have contributed to his desire for privacy. After the war, Mr. Beisheim worked as an electronics wholesaler. While traveling in the United States he observed how goods were sold from warehouses to customers for cash. The idea differed from the German practice of placing orders on credit and having goods delivered to retailers or other institutional buyers. Returning to Germany, he founded Metro, the country’s first cash-and-carry retailer, in 1964 at Mülheim an der Ruhr, in West Germany’s industrial heartland. He later joined with the Haniel and Schmidt-Ruthenbeck families and expanded the company into Austria and France. It later moved into Denmark and Italy as well. The Metro Group, which today includes the Metro cash-and-carry stores, the electronics stores Saturn and Media Markt, Real hypermarkets and the Kaufhof line of department stores across Europe and Asia, was formed through a merger of several companies in 1996. One of Mr. Beisheim’s main accomplishments at Metro was the purchase in 2006 of 85 Walmart stores by the group’s Real division. Walmart had decided to withdraw from Germany after losing billions of dollars over a decade; the stores now operate under the name Real. Mr. Beisheim’s wife of nearly 50 years, Inge, died in 1999. They had no children. He is leaving his fortune to two foundations that carry his name, one in Munich and the other in Baar, Switzerland.",

    "source": "Ex-Red Army Faction Members Sought in Robbery in Germany <eos> BERLIN — The German police have intensified their decades-long search for three members of the Red Army Faction, believed to be on the run since their far-left guerrilla group disbanded in 1998, after prosecutors said on Tuesday that they had linked them to at least one botched robbery last year. For more than two decades, federal prosecutors have had an arrest warrant out for Ernst-Volker Staub, 61, Burkhard Garweg, 47, and Daniela Marie-Luise Klette, 57, on suspicion of involvement in actions by the Red Army Faction, or R.A.F. These include the 1993 bombing of a prison in Weiterstadt, near Frankfurt. The group emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s when its members terrorized West Germany through a series of kidnappings, bombings and killings. Its members killed 34 people in an attempt to overthrow the capitalist government and fight what they saw as American imperialism. The last convicted R.A.F. member to have served time in jail, Birgit Hogefeld, was released in 2011 after serving 18 years of a life sentence for murder. Prosecutors in Verden, near the northern city of Bremen, said on Tuesday that they had begun a fresh investigation of the three fugitives on suspicion of attempted murder and robbery in conjunction with a bungled attempt in June to storm an armored security van stocked with cash. The group may also have been involved in another failed robbery of a similarly cash-laden transporter in December in Wolfsburg, also in northern Germany , but the authorities said evidence was still being evaluated. Marie-Louise Tartz, a spokeswoman for state prosecutors in Verden, said the group had been identified by analyzing DNA traces secured from two vehicles in the crime. Ms. Tartz said the forensic research could take several months in many cases, based on the quality of the evidence available. Federal and state prosecutors said that they did not believe the three suspects had been driven by terrorist motives, and that it appeared they had sought to carry out the robberies for purely financial reasons. “It is to be presumed that the crime was intended to finance a life lived underground,” state prosecutors in Verden said in a statement. The police used helicopters to search for the fugitives after they fled the scene of the attempted robbery in June, but found nothing. According to witnesses, the suspects, armed with automatic rifles, used a white Volkswagen van to block the armored carrier and opened fire, but failed to open the doors of the vehicle. No one was injured. The Red Army Faction, originally called the Baader-Meinhof gang, followed a Marxist-Leninist ideology and initially targeted American interests in West Germany. These included the United States Embassy in Bad Godesberg in 1991 and a bomb attack on an administrative building of the Deutsche Bank in 1990. Ms. Klette has been sought in both of those crimes. In 1999, more than a year after the group disbanded, Ms. Klette, Mr. Staub and Mr. Garweg threatened the driver of an armored vehicle with an automatic rifle and a rocket-propelled grenade. That time they made off with more than one million German marks.",

    "source": "To Tulane, for English and Altruism <eos> Brightwaters A LONG ISLANDER to the core, or so he thought, Dave Cahill never intended to become pathologically — well, almost — fond of New Orleans. So fond that, after Hurricane Katrina pulverized the poorer, less mythical city quadrants, he found himself mired, with a handful of fellow students from Tulane University, knee deep in muck in the Ninth Ward, wielding a shovel and a crowbar and gutting the moldy innards of ruined houses until only their skeletons remained. That’s what passed for neighborhood recovery in the early going. Putrid work, being a human wrecking ball incongruously in pursuit, during school hours, of a well-regarded degree in English and history. The digging was occasionally gruesome. One day, as part of Student Advocacy for Equitable Recovery, or Safer, he and a few other volunteers were dismantling a house in hard-hit St. Bernard Parish when a displaced occupant happened by and shared an anecdote: He told them that when the waters that fed an adjacent swamp swelled and crested, he and his family watched their grandmother’s roof, with the attic still attached, float by before submerging. And how was he certain it was his grandmother’s attic, the students, naïvely and nosily, wanted to know? Because her corpse was inside, he informed them, shrugging off the macabre aspects of such a discovery. “He told us, ‘Hey, life is hard here; people live and people die,’ ” Mr. Cahill said. “We were freaked out; he wasn’t. But mostly when I’m working on a house, it isn’t a sad thing anymore because it’s more like the first step to coming home for the family that lived there.” Not a life lesson Mr. Cahill encountered in the classroom. His commitment to the New Orleans rebuilding effort led him to join AmeriCorps and, with some original Safer volunteers, establish the Phoenix of New Orleans , or Pnola, a nonprofit neighborhood recovery association focused on the Lower Mid-City area. Mr. Cahill, now 23 and a 2008 Tulane graduate, had never intended to apply to Tulane, an older sister’s alma mater. But when Tulane mailed him an application, he blithely filled in the essays (as a winner of the Ethnic Pen writing contest sponsored by Bay Shore High School and a participant in the mock United Nations program, his communications skill set was rote), sent it back and was surprised by the size of the scholarship the university dangled in front of him. It would have been rude to refuse it; not to mention it would have caused undeserved aggravation for his progressive parents — his father, Michael Cahill, is an environmental lawyer with a 1-0 record before the United States Supreme Court; his mother, Peggy Lambert, is a dean at St. George’s University School of Medicine in Grenada. So off he went and proceeded to be miserable until he experienced a life-shifting conversion that was meteorological, not religious, in nature. “I eventually changed my attitude on account of a giant hurricane that destroyed the heart of a city I hadn’t even known because it and our campus were like separate worlds,” he reflected last weekend, back on Long Island to organize his second Pnola fund-raiser; the first, in 2006, yielded $20,000 that translated, thanks to free student labor, to $750,000 worth of rebuilt homes. “We built three houses before the fund-raiser up here,” he said, mentioning an off-campus beer pong party as a major if irreverent revenue source, “and we’ve finished another 12 rebuilds since. Not bad for a little nonprofit company. It’s a tough sell, raising funds for a cause that dropped out of everyone’s consciousness three years ago.” Like many conversions, Mr. Cahill’s took time. It also required some strong-arming from a college friend, Jim Coningsby, the creator of Safer in 2005 and, coincidentally, another Bay Shore native, albeit one who relocated to Virginia in boyhood. “He told me that if I didn’t come back down there and find out how the gutting world works, I’d regret it,” Mr. Cahill said. “Jimmy, by the way, still hasn’t graduated. I can understand it; I mean, how can you sit around reading a book when you know there are people out there who really need help?” Freshman year had not endeared Mr. Cahill, who expects to attend law school after his second AmeriCorps term ends (“Pnola can use a lawyer”), to Tulane. He was homesick for Bay Shore, pondering an East Coast transfer, and didn’t hurry back for the opening day of sophomore semester. When Katrina encroached and Tulane shut down, he was still safe at home; then he was “relocated” for a semester to Boston University, which temporarily took in displaced Tulane students. “My friends had horror stories to tell, but all I lost was a semester of school,” he said in the midst of jazzing up his parents’ stately colonial-style home in Brightwaters for the fund-raiser. “But they say that if you stay in New Orleans more than five years, you’re never going to leave.” When the overload of blinking pink flamingo garlands, twinkling holiday lights and red-hot chili pepper lanterns blew a fuse, Mr. Cahill scurried down to the basement to restore full illumination. Also on his to-do roster: a side trip to the living room to patch an unsightly damp spot on the ceiling caused by a balky upstairs toilet; not a repair he would have been capable of making before his immersion in New Orleans-style gut-and-revive artisanship. But now? “A snap.” Charity begins at home. At least it did last weekend, but only until Monday morning, when Mr. Cahill made a beeline back to New Orleans. Five uninhabitable but remediable houses, and five anxious families, were waiting for him and his team to work some nonprofit magic by Christmas. The benefit raised $11,000. In Pnola arithmetic, that’s about $375,000. In other words, welcome home, folks.",

    "source": "Liberal Feminists Ponder Friends, Foes and Carly Fiorina <eos> When the novelist Jennifer Weiner watched the second Republican presidential debate with her two daughters on Sept. 16, she felt a sense of pride at seeing the lone woman on stage, Carly Fiorina , hold her own against Donald J. Trump. Then Mrs. Fiorina denounced abortion and Planned Parenthood in a graphic monologue that thrilled many conservative Republican voters but left Ms. Weiner appalled. “It’s so weird — she looks like one of us, but she’s not,” said Ms. Weiner, who in addition to being a best-selling author is an influential feminist with a large social-media following. “You’re on the bus with her until she starts talking about Planned Parenthood.” As Mrs. Fiorina’s presidential campaign gains traction — and as the focus on her statements about Planned Parenthood intensifies — liberal women across the web are expressing conflicted feelings about her candidacy. At times, there is gratification at watching a woman forcefully take on Mr. Trump; at other times, horror at Mrs. Fiorina’s conservative policy positions, which these women see as anathema to the feminist cause. “Can you love a campaign but hate a candidate’s policies?” read the subtitle of Robin Marty’s Sept. 18 essay on Cosmopolitan.com titled “Carly Fiorina Is the Candidate I Wanted Hillary Clinton to Be.” Mrs. Fiorina has encouraged feminists to take her seriously. After Mr. Trump’s remarks about her looks — “Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that?” he told Rolling Stone magazine — her “ super PAC ,” Carly for America, released a video advertisement called “Faces,” in which she turned the insult to her advantage. In the ad, as the faces of women flash across the screen — young and old, black and white, all of them beaming — Mrs. Fiorina tells a heavily female audience: “We are not a special-interest group. We are the majority of the nation.” (It is a line she repeated in the Republican debate.) “This is the face of a 61-year-old woman,” she says later in the ad, as the audience whoops and whistles its approval. “I am proud of every year and every wrinkle.” Such shows of defiance and forcefulness by Mrs. Fiorina have impressed many liberal women. Tracy Clark-Flory, a senior staff writer for Vocativ.com who has written about sex and relationships for Salon and other outlets, said Mrs. Fiorina’s debate turn was a powerful moment that created some dissonance given her stands on the issues. “I think even as a lot of feminists cheered her on during that performance, we were loathing her actual policies,” she said. “There’s an excitement and a horror that those two can kind of coexist.” Left-leaning feminists have not been so conflicted by other Republican candidates for national office in recent years. Both Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 2008, and Michele Bachmann, a congresswoman who ran for the Republican nomination in 2012, went out of their way to attack traditional feminism. Mrs. Fiorina has spoken critically of traditional feminism, too: In June, when she still barely registered in national presidential polls, she declared in a speech that the liberal “version of feminism isn’t working” and said her definition of “a feminist is a woman who lives the life she chooses.” That differs from the definition that Mrs. Clinton gave in an interview with the actress and writer Lena Dunham, the creator and star of the HBO series “Girls,” for a website Ms. Dunham is starting. When Ms. Dunham asked Mrs. Clinton if she considered herself a feminist, she replied, “Yes, absolutely,” and expressed puzzlement at women who did not. “A feminist is by definition someone who believes in equal rights,” she said. Still, Mrs. Fiorina’s background as a former chief executive at Hewlett-Packard and her role in calling out Mr. Trump, whose remarks have offended women in both parties, have captured the attention of many writers, activists and other influential figures in the feminist movement, as reflected on social media and in news outlets targeted at young women. It was an irony first pointed out by the conservative blogger Michelle Malkin. “Carly Fiorina is an ice-cold shade queen debate princess and I’m in love with and terrified of her,” Erin Gloria Ryan, managing editor of the feminist blog Jezebel , wrote on Twitter on Sept. 16. In an interview, Ms. Ryan said that as a feminist she was of two minds about Mrs. Fiorina’s candidacy, at times drawn to her and at times repulsed by her positions and what many critics say were her exaggerated statements about a Planned Parenthood video. In addition to opposing abortion, Mrs. Fiorina opposes raising the minimum wage, federally mandated paid maternity leave and the Affordable Care Act, policies that disproportionately affect women. “I am constantly pivoting mentally with her,” Ms. Ryan said, adding that she had not at all been torn about opposing Mrs. Palin or Mrs. Bachmann. Mrs. Fiorina, she said, is “contrary to the conservative female narrative, the way she looks, the way she presents herself, the no-nonsense businesswoman thing.” In an interview, Ms. Marty, the Cosmopolitan writer, said she had been disappointed by the caution of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign so far and was intrigued by Mrs. Fiorina’s brassy candor and fearlessness. Still, she said that under no circumstance could she ever vote for someone who opposed abortion rights. Ms. Marty said that for liberal feminists, cheering on Mrs. Fiorina was like eating at McDonald’s. “You know, inherently, it’s not something you should be eating,” she said. “But when there’s nothing else around, it’s what you go and take.” Who’s Winning the Presidential Campaign? History suggests that each party’s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling. Republican women say the feminist head-scratching about Mrs. Fiorina has brought to light a hypocritical aspect of the women’s movement. “They’re not really looking for equal representation — they’re looking for more Democratic women representation,” said Katie Packer, a Republican strategist. Yet the more that liberal feminist writers and activists — many of whom view abortion rights as the ultimate litmus test — hear from Mrs. Fiorina, the less conflicted they may become. In particular, Mrs. Fiorina is standing by her assertion in the Sept. 16 debate that she had viewed a video about Planned Parenthood showing “a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, ‘We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.’” Planned Parenthood and other abortion-rights advocacy groups have called Mrs. Fiorina’s assertion “completely false,” and many news organizations have concluded that she was describing a video that did not exist. On Thursday, Mrs. Fiorina visited an anti-abortion pregnancy center in Spartanburg, S.C., where she took journalists into an examination room as she observed an expectant mother’s ultrasound and remarked upon the fetal heartbeat and developing spine. “Liberals and progressives will spend inordinate amounts of time and money protecting fish, frogs and flies,” Mrs. Fiorina said outside afterward. “They do not think a 17-week-old, a 20-week-old, a 24-week-old is worth saving.” On Saturday, women wearing pink, some of whom were affiliated with Planned Parenthood, protested Mrs. Fiorina at a campaign appearance in Iowa, throwing condoms and chanting, “Women are watching, and we vote.” On Sunday, in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Mrs. Fiorina insisted that the scene in the video she had described “absolutely does exist,” but offered no evidence to back up her contention. Anna Holmes, who founded Jezebel and now writes for Fusion.net , said Mrs. Fiorina had lied in her depiction of the video. “She’s tough and she’s very well spoken, but I just don’t think she speaks the truth,” she said. Acknowledging the early interest among some feminists in Mrs. Fiorina’s candidacy, none other than Gloria Steinem weighed in, calling Mrs. Fiorina’s claims about Planned Parenthood “a 100 percent lie.” “Trump’s greatest damage to women,” Ms. Steinem said in a Facebook post , “was to raise sympathy for Carly Fiorina by attacking her appearance.”",

    "source": "5 European Nations Agree to Help U.S. Crack Down on Tax Evasion <eos> PARIS — Washington won important backing Wednesday for an effort to identify offshore accounts held by Americans, as key European allies agreed to help. In a joint statement, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain said they wanted “to intensify their cooperation in combating international tax evasion.” In return, Washington has agreed to “reciprocate in collecting and exchanging” information about U.S. accounts held by residents of those countries. The agreement concerns the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, known as Fatca, which became law as part of a 2010 jobs bill . Fatca is meant to help the U.S. Internal Revenue Service identify hidden accounts and other assets held overseas by Americans, but the law has caused an outcry among foreign financial institutions that fear the cost of compliance as well as what they have said are unrealistically tight implementation deadlines. There were also concerns that Fatca — which will require that virtually every financial institution in the world report any accounts held by Americans, with a withholding penalty for noncompliance — would put banks into a position of violating national secrecy laws to comply. The United States and the five European countries said Wednesday that they would get around the secrecy problem by having financial institutions share data with their own governments, which would then share with Washington. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, welcomed the government-to-government approach, saying it would greatly reduce “the administrative burden, compliance costs and legal difficulties.” The U.S. Congress estimated that Fatca would raise up to $1 billion a year for 10 years after implementation, a cost that banks have argued will be dwarfed by the cost of compliance, which has been estimated at up to $100 million for each multinational bank, according to the European Commission. Algirdas Semeta, the E.U. tax commissioner, said he was confident that the information-sharing deal would help to accomplish the common goal of addressing international tax evasion “in a business-friendly manner.” U.S. Treasury officials say privately that they hope other countries that have raised objections to Fatca, including Canada, Switzerland, China and Japan, will see the benefits of the approach announced Wednesday and that the agreement is almost certain to expand. They say discussions with other countries are continuing. The necessity of getting China on board for any such global deal is evident, as evidenced by Beijing’s announcement this week that it had forbidden its airlines to participate in an E.U. carbon tax program. Li Xinghao, a spokesman for the China Banking Regulatory Commission, said last month of Fatca that “unless the law is modified, the China Banking Regulatory Commission has no right to mandate Chinese banks to disclose account information of U.S. clients to the U.S. taxing authorities.” The agreements with the European countries will not provide an exemption from Fatca for any jurisdiction, but if a country were to oblige all of its financial institutions to automatically hand over all account data related to Americans, then it could obtain blanket exemption for its banks to transfer funds between themselves without being subject to the so-called pass-through payment withholding requirement for transactions with noncompliant institutions. The pass-through payment measure has been one of the elements most hotly contested by the financial industry. The announcement Wednesday came as the I.R.S. proposed rules to implement the law in a 388-page document that addressed some of the criticisms. Douglas H. Shulman, the I.R.S. commissioner, acknowledged in a statement that compliance “creates a significant undertaking for financial institutions,” and said the proposed regulations “reflect our commitment to take into account the implementation challenges of affected financial institutions while allowing for a smooth and timely rollout of the law.” Denise Hintzke, head of the global tax compliance initiative at Deloitte in New York, said the rules included extending some compliance deadlines and allowing greater use of computerized searches of existing accounts for signs of American connections. Fatca has also been criticized by American expatriates because it imposes new reporting requirements. Some have said it makes Americans less attractive as clients for financial institutions, raising the cost of doing business overseas. Those criticisms were not addressed in the proposed rules.

    "source": "Two Losses Put Illinois’s Dedication in Question <eos> Steam seemed to be rising from Coach Bruce Weber’s head as he assessed the unthinkable: a 57-54 beating his University of Illinois basketball team had just taken from its outmanned in-state rival Illinois-Chicago last Saturday at the United Center. Flaunting a 10-1 record, a seven-game winning streak and a No. 12 national ranking coming in, the Illini appeared listless and bored against the struggling Flames (4-7), a Horizon League midmajor under a first-year coach, Howard Moore, and lost to them for the first time in 20 years. “We froze down the stretch and didn’t make plays,” Weber said, visibly irritated. “We played like we were worried about losing rather than taking the game to them.” The effort, Weber conceded, just wasn’t there, and that was an affront to him. The Big Ten, regardless of what it calls its divisions in a planned realignment, is a grown-up’s league. Weber has logged 25 years in it, the first 18 as an assistant under gruff Gene Keady at blue-collar Purdue. He believes teams succeed by grinding down opponents, outworking, outthinking and outhustling them. “Our approach to practice finally caught up with us,” Weber said. Jerrance Howard, an assistant coach, had a more extreme reaction. “The most embarrassing loss in the history of Illinois basketball,” he declared . A tough opponent in a high-energy building provided an intriguing setting for a bounce-back game four nights later, but it proved less than ideal. Illinois took another step in the wrong direction Wednesday, falling to Missouri, 75-64, before a divided house of 21,906 at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis. So with a week off before the start of Big Ten play, Illinois finds itself with a 10-3 record, a two-game losing streak, and some doubt as to its capabilities. Weber was less critical of the Illini’s effort against Missouri than he was of a strange call that set up a six-point possession for the Tigers: An intentional foul against Mike Tisdale rewarded Lawrence Bowers with two free throws, plus the layup he made despite Tisdale’s half-hearted effort to impede him. Missouri retained possession, and Marcus Denmon converted a layup on the inbounds play. Weber then drew a technical foul as he continued to fume over the call on Tisdale. Denmon made two free throws to complete an eight-point, 14-second flurry that decided what had been a back-and-forth game. “Being a top 10 team by Christmas was one of our goals,” Weber said. “That’s obviously not going to happen. Leadership is always tested when things go bad.” Leadership should not be an issue for the Illini — seniors Demetri McCamey, Mike Davis and Tisdale are experienced hands who have appeared in 353 games and made 261 starts at Illinois. Weber has rounded out his roster with some of the biggest names from the Illinois high school ranks, dispelling talk-show grousing that he can’t recruit top-level homegrown talent. Derrick Rose, Jon Scheyer, Sherron Collins, Jacob Pullen and other Chicago-area prep stars made their college bones elsewhere, true. But current sophomore D. J. Richardson, from Peoria, and freshman Jereme Richmond, of Waukegan, were high school All-Americans. Richmond, the consensus player of the year in Illinois last season, committed to the Illini as a ninth-grader. Michael Shaw, a skilled power forward from Chicago’s De La Salle Institute, headlines a flashy incoming class for 2011-12. But young stars who have been fawned over, catered to and offered scholarships since adolescence don’t always function as role players. A sense of entitlement sometimes blinds them to the need to bring maximum effort every night in an environment as competitive as the Big Ten. McCamey, with his tendency to drift in and out of a dominant role at point guard, embodies the state of the team. Against Missouri, 8 of his 14 points came during a fast-paced second-half sequence that featured the most entertaining basketball of the night. Down the stretch he managed just two quiet points as the Tigers closed out the game with a 23-7 run. “We’ve lost our sense of urgency,” McCamey said. “We haven’t been pushing each other. We’ve been relaxed, a little soft. The seniors have to get it back on track. With the Big Ten season coming, we’ve got to get back to being hard-nosed.” Weber is a smart coach who always seemed at his best with tough-minded overachievers who competed every night, played hard and regarded losing as unacceptable. A star-packed roster is a departure for him. But missing the N.C.A.A. tournament will change a man’s thinking. It has happened to Illinois in two of the last three years. Illinois has beaten Gonzaga, Maryland and North Carolina while compiling 10 wins against a nonconference schedule that will look good on a tournament résumé. In the Big Ten, only Ohio State has separated itself from the pack, but there are enough teams at or close to Illinois’ level that it could finish anywhere from second to eighth. “We have talent, there’s no doubt,” Weber said. “But are we going to be a good team? It’s up to them. They’ve got to want it. If I want it more than they do, we’re in trouble.”",

    "source": "Panel Throws Out Suit by Man Who Fell on Track <eos> A jury said he deserved $2.3 million, but an appeals court panel on Tuesday threw out a lawsuit filed by a man who lost part of his leg after he fell into the path of a subway train while drunk. The jurors did not have enough evidence to conclude that the motorman could have stopped the train before it hit the man, Dustin Dibble, in April 2006, a state Appellate Division panel said. Mr. Dibble, 26, lost part of his right leg in the accident at Union Square station. He had been out with friends watching ice hockey at a bar, according to his lawyer, and said he was too drunk to remember how he ended up on the tracks or anything about the accident. Jurors last year found that Mr. Dibble bore some responsibility for his injury, but they put most of the blame on New York City Transit, which runs the city’s buses and subways. “The jury’s determination that the accident could have been avoided was based on nothing more than a series of estimated stopping distances,” the judges wrote in the ruling on Tuesday. The motorman died before the trial but had testified that he initially saw a lump that “looked like garbage,” and did not immediately stop because debris is common on the tracks. He said he stopped a few seconds later after seeing the object move. Mr. Dibble’s lawyer, Andrew Smiley, said the appeals court had intruded on a question it should have left to the jury. “The issue was whether or not he should have stopped upon seeing a mass on the tracks,” Mr. Smiley said. “That was an issue for the jury to decide, and they decided he shouldn’t have been mistaken for a piece of garbage.” He said that Mr. Dibble intended to appeal. The transit agency said it was pleased with the ruling. It said in a statement that the public should not have to compensate people who “place themselves in positions of obvious danger through their own reckless conduct.”",

Bindler was at home in Longview during his summer break from film school in New York. After leaving a bar late one night, he stumbled upon a curious scene at the local Nissan dealership. People were crowded around a pickup truck, one hand pressed to its body, trying to maintain contact despite the exhaustion of having already stood there for a couple of days — yes, days. The scene became the basis of Mr. Bindler’s 1997 documentary “Hands on a Hardbody,” which follows 24 colorful Piney Woods contestants competing to win the truck in an endurance test to see who can keep his or her hand on the vehicle the longest. (The winner in his film lasted 77 hours.) “Some wanted the truck for the truck,” Mr. Bindler, known as Robb, said. “Some wanted the truck for what the truck could bring to them: just raw dollars. Some wanted to sell the truck and buy a different truck. And some wanted to sell the truck to pay bills.” The movie has spawned similar oddball contests and even a stage adaptation that recently opened on Broadway. To commemorate the release of a new DVD featuring 86 additional minutes of interviews with the contestants, a restored version of the film will be screened in various Texas cities. “The irony of the contest is that it concerns the American dream, win something for nothing,” Mr. Bindler said. “And yet it’s a Japanese truck.” Lantex Theater, April 12, 7 p.m., handsonahard bodythemovie.com . GRAND PRAIRIE Out of the Gates The Kentucky Derby, the first installment in the Triple Crown of thoroughbred racing, is just three weeks away. People know that the thing to do is dress in preppy springtime clothes and sip mint juleps, the Derby’s official drink. But many people know little to nothing about racing. Now they can get acquainted with the relationship between the horses and their jockeys at Lone Star Park, where the spring thoroughbred season opens this weekend with Texas-bred 3-year-olds and older. Learn racing terms like furlong and trifecta, and do it from the newly renovated dining terraces. . Outlandish hats optional. Lone Star Park, April 12-July 6, lonestarpark.com . DALLAS Preserve the Reserve A lot of people take water for granted. Unless the utility bill goes unpaid, there’s no reason to think that it won’t flow freely from your faucet. But the supply of this precious resource is dwindling as demand increases. While state leaders are proposing legislation to address water conservation and to allocate financing to build new reservoirs, individuals are being asked to scale back their personal use. “We’ve been in a drought for so long and entertaining a perpetual drought that could put us back in something like the Dust Bowl,” said Sahar Sea of the Trinity River Audubon Center, the host of “Water in Texas,” a town hall presentation featuring speakers from the Texas Conservation Alliance and Dallas Water Utilities. It will try to get to the bottom of Ms. Sea’s $64,000 question, “In 20 years, where’s the water going to come from?” Trinity River Audubon Center, April 18, 7 p.m., trinityriver audubon.org. AUSTIN Like Family The Old Settler’s Music Festival, four days of Americana bands including the Gourds, Son Volt and Carolina Chocolate Drops, fosters a community spirit hard to find in the era of megafestivals. When Sarah Jarosz, a singer and multi-instrumentalist from Wimberley, was just 10 and part of the band Spurs of the Moment, a spellbound audience embraced her. And she went on to become a Grammy-nominated solo act. Meanwhile, marquee musicians have been known to unlock the hidden musical talents of festivalgoers; Bill Kreutzmann of the Grateful Dead engaged in late-night jam sessions with his fans in the campgrounds. And one couple who met at Old Settler’s later returned to get married in front of 2,000 people. The Salt Lick BBQ Pavilion & Camp Ben McCulloch, April 18-21, oldsettlersmusicfest.org .

AUSTIN Capital C for Country Wayne Hancock, the Denton honky-tonk musician, will return to Austin, his former home, in support of “Ride,” a new album that glues together the old and new country (ripped apart recently by Blake Shelton), with rocking electric guitar to update a voice often compared to Hank Williams Sr.’s.

    "source": "9 Points, 4 Goals and Looking Ahead <eos> What a month. It’s truly hard to put into words how exciting and memorable June has been for me. The obvious thrill came three times over when my United States teammates and I pulled off huge victories against Jamaica, Panama and Honduras in World Cup qualifying. Getting those nine points and earning a spot alone atop the Hex was huge in our quest to make that coveted trip to Brazil next year. I think it’s safe to say — and obvious for those watching us — that we’ve really continued to develop a chemistry with one another and grown as a team with each match. I know I see and feel it, so hopefully the fans and soccer pundits have noticed the improvement from the start of camp to where we are currently as a team. It won’t be for another few months or so that we come together again, so hopefully we pick up where we left off in Utah and remember what helped us get such positive results. Personally, it goes without saying those games were extremely important. Scoring for my country in all three qualifiers, as well in the US Soccer Centennial friendly against Germany, was simply great and showed how well we are clicking as an offensive unit. At that level of play, we aren’t going to get an abundant amount of quality scoring opportunities. So finding the back of the next was satisfying and hopefully made the fans proud. As I finish this latest blog entry back home in Florida, I’m getting ready for my trip to New York City for a bunch of appearances, interviews and other events. I was set to participate in a special event, highlighted by a charity auction, at the Astor Center, which was held Wednesday, where athletes and some of the country’s most decorated chefs joined forces with the Partnership at Drugfree.org to raise awareness for the organization. I put together a great package for the auction with my New York Red Bulls family, so I’m excited to see how much money we can raise for the organization. On Thursday, I am doing something I truly love and that’s meeting fans. I will be at Upper 90 soccer store for an autograph-signing session from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at its Upper West Side location. There will be a suggested donation for items being signed, with all the money raised going toward projects with the Jozy Altidore Foundation. Until then, it’s back to packing and getting in that “Empire State of Mind” (cue Jay-Z and Alicia Keys). As always, thank you for the continued support for me and my teammates. Our fans and supporters are truly amazing. I can’t wait to get back on the field later this summer wearing the red, white and blue.

    "source": "Spain Offers Citizenship to Exiles’ Kin <eos> ROME — The descendants of those exiled from Spain during the Spanish Civil War and the fascist dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco may claim Spanish citizenship under legislation that went into effect over the weekend. The Spanish government expects half a million people, many of them in Argentina, Venezuela, Cuba and elsewhere in Latin America, to file for citizenship under the new measure, the Spanish newspaper El País reported. A government spokesman was not immediately able to confirm the figure on Sunday. The citizenship law covers the period from July 18, 1936, to Dec. 31, 1955, which includes the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1939 and the first decades of the fascist dictatorship, which ended with Franco’s death in 1975. The act is part of the “law of historical memory,” a landmark and controversial piece of legislation passed last year by the Socialist government of Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero aimed at encouraging Spain to resolve issues from its bloody 20th-century history. The law also provides public financing to unearth the mass graves in which thousands of Spaniards were buried during the war. It also requires the removal of many symbols from the Franco dictatorship from state buildings and public spaces. Those applying for citizenship must present proof of their parents’ or grandparents’ place and date of birth, according to the Web site of the Spanish Justice Ministry . The government plans to accept applications until December 2010. Those deemed eligible would not have to renounce their other citizenship.",

    "source": "Back-to-School Discounts Are Deeper, More Creative <eos> Parents shopping for back-to-school gear could be forgiven for walking into a store nowadays and thinking they have gone through a time warp. With 1930s prices for pens, glue, notebooks and even T-shirts, the season seems more “Back to the Future” than back to school. A penny these days buys eight No. 2 pencils at Staples or a wooden ruler at OfficeMax. Fifty cents buys a watercolor set at Target. A box of 24 Crayola crayons is the cost of a gumball — 25 cents. Or, as Sharon Hartley, vice president for United States marketing and sales for Crayola, put it: “Sixteen boxes of a 24-pack equals a gallon of gas.” Such pocket-change bargains, known as loss leaders, are not a novel strategy for retailers, of course. But in the first back-to-school season since the economy weakened considerably, the discounts are earlier, deeper and more creative than in previous years. Staples, for instance, has offered one-cent deals before, though this is the first year the retailer is giving away products, like Elmer’s glue. Thrift is the theme this back-to-school year: people are spending less, consolidating shopping trips, forgoing discretionary items and going without new wardrobes and backpacks. And stores are trying to play to the public mood. “I’ve seen a much higher prevalence of those types of big attention-grabber promotions this season,” said Stacy Janiak, an analyst with Deloitte. “The one-cent deals, the bundling of products or three-for-two deals. I’ve seen a lot of that, much more than in the past.” Loss leaders are called that because by selling items at a loss or even giving them away, stores can lure in shoppers who will buy other, more profitable items. Drawn by the prospect of free glue, Laura Janowski, 23, stocked up on school supplies for her siblings, 12 and 14, at a Staples store in Rolling Meadows, Ill., this week. “Now, I just need to find the 9-cent filler paper and 33-cent index cards,” she said. Even as consumers visit stores like Staples, lured in by the penny deals, they are doing much of their shopping at discount and off-price retailers. There they can buy everything from sneakers to paperclips, and prices are low throughout the store, not just on a few select items. “With the high price of gas and food this summer, it is absolutely necessary for me to try to save money on back-to-school shopping,” said Jennifer Lee, a mother of three, ages 9, 12 and 15, as she loaded her minivan with bags of folders and binders from a Wal-Mart in Rolling Meadows, Ill. “That means reusing last year’s scissors and markers, and even the old spiral notebooks that have only a few pages used.” Ms. Janiak of Deloitte said 71 percent of households would cut their spending on back-to-school items this year, with 48 percent planning to reduce spending by more than $100. Deborah Weinswig, an analyst with Citigroup, said 75 percent of consumers planned to spend less than $400 on back-to-school shopping, up from 45 percent last year. “Everyone is just much more price focused,” Ms. Weinswig said. It is perhaps no surprise, then, that Wal-Mart on Thursday announced record earnings for the three months ending in July and raised its full-year earnings forecast to $3.43 to $3.50 a share, up from $3.30 to $3.43. The bargain retailer’s profit rose to $3.4 billion, or 87 cents a share, up from $2.9 billion, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales at American stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales and a measure of retail health, rose to 4.5 percent (not including fuel) for the quarter, up from 1.9 percent last year. “Their sweet spot within the customer framework are items below $10 and items that customers are familiar with,” said Bill Dreher, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. “It’s working.” Wal-Mart has been offering back-to-school deals like a week’s worth of children’s outfits (five tops and five bottoms) for $60, though it too is selling school supplies for pennies. “You have a series of wow items,” John Simley, a spokesman for Wal-Mart, said this week. “People are coming in expecting to buy a notebook. But 5 cents for a notebook? You can get 20 for a buck.” Andrew Schneider, director of global brand management for Staples, said compelling penny offers bring customers into stores. “And they then will discover the wide range of products we have,” he said. Analysts agree that in an economic downturn penny deals help retailers retain, if not gain, customers. More important, the eye-popping deals can keep a retailer at the top of consumers’ minds. “Can you afford to sell something for a penny?,” said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group’s chief industry analyst. “The answer is, you can’t afford not to.” In addition to price, a big appeal of discounters is that they offer one-stop shopping, saving consumers fuel. “I think everybody thinks twice about heading out,” said Debbie Pinciotto as she led a gaggle of teenage girls on a scavenger hunt through Westfield Sunrise mall in Massapequa, N.Y. She plans to do the bulk of her back-to-school clothing shopping in a few weeks, after her older daughter receives her birthday presents. “When she gets the gift cards, we’ll go,” Ms. Pinciotto said. Many consumers, not content with bargain school supplies, are planning to use discount cards being mailed out by the likes of Kohl’s and J. C. Penney, which this week announced a rewards a program that allows customers to earn points from purchases and receive members-only benefits. Analysts said apparel sales would suffer this season as parents send children back to school in last year’s clothes. Those that do buy new gear will use rewards cards and coupons in September, even October, when the weather cools and their children have determined what fashions are in vogue. Two department stores on Thursday released earnings reports for the three months ending Aug. 2, illustrating the disparity between discount retailers and department stores. Nordstrom, the luxury chain, reported a 21 percent decline in profit to $143 million, or 65 cents a share, down from $180 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. Same-store sales decreased 6 percent for the quarter. The company’s lower-priced Nordstrom Rack stores fared well with same-store sales increasing 6.3 percent for the quarter. Its full-price stores struggled, however, with same-stores sales decreasing 9 percent in the quarter. Kohl’s profit decreased 12 percent to $236 million, or 77 cents a share, down from $269 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. Same store sales for the quarter decreased 4.6 percent. In a conference call with investors, Wes McDonald, Kohl’s chief financial officer, said that of all the marketing areas the company was concentrating on, the most important was “emphasizing value in all our advertising.” While it is unlikely back-to-school clothes will be sold for pocket change, consumers should expect to see more sales and rewards programs as summer turns to fall. “The consumer knows they’re in the driver’s seat,” said Mr. Cohen of NPD Group. “The retailer’s going to blink first.”",

    "source": "Couple Who Ran Emperor’s Club VIP, Tied to Spitzer, Have New Venture <eos> An untold number of customers were willing to pay $5,000 an hour for an escort from Emperor’s Club VIP , the Internet prostitution ring run by a 62-year-old former Israeli tax official and his bubbly 20-something girlfriend that in 2008 helped end the political career of Eliot Spitzer, also known then as Client No. 9. But as yet it is unclear whether business will be as brisk for the latest Internet venture that this unusual couple — now both out of prison and married last summer — have undertaken: an empowerment seminar for which they will be asking $35,000 a person. The course and the book at its center, “The Science of Activating Your Supreme Power,” are written by Mark Brener and Cecil Suwal — once Internet procurers, then, in relatively short order, federal defendants, federal inmates, man and wife and now empowerment entrepreneurs. Their One World Initiative , billed as “the perspective that unifies the world’s diverse religions and beliefs,” is nothing if not ambitious. Its Web site's headings include “Supercharge Key Relationships,” “Rise Above the Competition,” “Be Rich Forever” and “Look and Feel Half your Age.” The book, published last month by CBN Media, according to Amazon, offers even more. “Transform your relationships into oases of bliss, love and emotional support,” the promotional copy on the Web site says. “Generate additional millions and billions in financial wealth; and have the mind-set that allows you to fully enjoy it.” Indeed, it seems there is little that the book does not offer, if you read the promotional copy. “Become immortal and adore every minute of it,” it continues. “Live the life of your dreams.” Ms. Suwal, who has a seemingly irrepressible giggle, acknowledged in a telephone interview on Monday night that some people might find it surprising that she and Mr. Brener, who were married in August 2010, had undertaken this new venture. “It may seem that way,” she said, “but like anyone else, Mark and I have many facets to our personalities, and this is something we’ve been into for years.” She pointed to the old Emperor’s VIP Web site, which she said even then reflected a measure of their philosophy, and quoted from some of the marketing copy that graced the gauzy photographs of women in lingerie: “Our goal is to make life more peaceful, balanced, beautiful and meaningful.” Mr. Brener, to whom she eventually passed the phone, said he did not expect to offer the empowerment seminar for six months or so, by which time, he said, he expected the book would be widely read and “people who can afford it will definitely contact us.” The underlying ideas, he said, were refined in prison — he was released in May 2010 and she in November 2009 — where he read a great deal, including meditations by Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson and the psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl . “I was thinking about, basically, there is a pattern in this world if we start thinking about crossing the desert or being in the wilderness and we found ourselves — right? — in very similar situation, we were under enormous pressure,” he said. “Anxiety, depression, for a number of months, and after that we found ourselves time that we can think, analyze and basically the outcome from our perspective, it’s very positive,” he continued. “I would say it was like — because I was reading a lot when I was in prison — it is like diamonds; they’ve always been created under pressure and fire and heat.” Asked about the cost of the seminar, which appears to include a provision that participants will give 3 percent of the first $1 million they earn as a result of having taken the course to Ms. Suwal and Mr. Brener, Ms. Suwal said, “Well you know, it’s not really that far from a lot of industry standards.”",

    "source": "Cleveland Reaches Settlement With Justice Department Over Police Conduct <eos> CLEVELAND — Cleveland has reached a settlement with the Justice Department over what federal authorities said was a pattern of unconstitutional policing and excessive use of force, people briefed on the case said Monday. The settlement, which could be announced as early as Tuesday, comes days after a judge declared a Cleveland police officer not guilty of manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a car’s two unarmed occupants, both of them black. The verdict prompted a day and night of protests and reignited discussions about how police officers treat the city’s African-American residents. The details of the settlement were not immediately clear, but in similar talks in recent years, the Justice Department has required cities to allow independent monitors to oversee changes in police departments. Settlements are typically backed by court orders and often call for improved training and revised policies for the use of force. A spokeswoman for the Cleveland Division of Police referred questions to the mayor’s office, which would not comment on Monday. Dena Iverson, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, also had no comment. The Justice Department opened an inquiry into the Cleveland police force months after the 2012 shooting of the unarmed occupants in a car, and issued its report in December. Cleveland is among several cities, including Ferguson, Mo., New York and Baltimore, that have become focal points of a national debate over policing and race. On Saturday, demonstrators spent hours marching through Cleveland after a judge acquitted Officer Michael Brelo of manslaughter for his role in the 2012 shooting, which began with a police chase of the car. While several officers fired a combined 137 shots, Officer Brelo was singled out for manslaughter charges because he climbed onto the hood of the car after the pursuit ended and fired 15 shots into the vehicle. Video A Cleveland police officer who climbed onto the hood of a car after a chase and fired repeatedly at its unarmed occupants in 2012 was acquitted of manslaughter on Saturday by an Ohio judge. Credit Credit Tony Dejak/Associated Press The occupants, Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams, died from gunshot wounds. The judge ruled that the actions of Officer Brelo, who is white, were lawful. Cleveland’s streets have stayed calm since Saturday, when the police reported 71 arrests, some on felony charges. Dozens of protesters appeared in court here Monday on misdemeanor charges. Some still wore T-shirts with messages like “I Can’t Breathe,” a reference to Eric Garner, who died after being put in a police chokehold in Staten Island last year, and “Black Lives Matter.” For Cleveland, a settlement with the Justice Department averts a long and costly court fight and the appearance that city leaders are resisting change. Mayor Frank Jackson faces a recall petition from city activists who say, among other grievances, that he has not done enough to prevent police abuses. The Justice Department has called Mr. Jackson a full partner in its effort to improve the police force. The Justice Department has opened nearly two dozen investigations into police departments under the Obama administration. Federal investigators found patterns of unconstitutional policing in cities including Seattle, Newark, Albuquerque and Ferguson. Federal authorities recently announced they would investigate the Baltimore police after Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man, died of injuries he suffered while in custody. In Seattle, the federal inquiry led local officials to overhaul training and focus on how officers can calm tense situations without using force. In Albuquerque, city officials agreed to change the way the police are trained, outfit officers with body cameras and improve how the department investigates officer-involved shootings. Officials in Ferguson are negotiating a possible settlement over accusations that officers routinely violated the Constitution. The Justice Department’s report on the Cleveland police was among its most scathing, finding that they engaged in a pattern of “unreasonable and unnecessary use of force.” Image Mayor Frank Jackson and Police Chief Calvin Williams held a news conference Sunday after Officer Michael Brelo’s acquittal. Credit Michael F. McElroy for The New York Times Investigators said officers unnecessarily used deadly force; used excessive force against mentally ill people; and inappropriately resorted to stun guns , chemical sprays and punches. It detailed tactical blunders, and said officers too often imperiled bystanders when they used force. The Justice Department also criticized a “structurally flawed” discipline policy that it said made it too hard to punish officers for improperly using force. The report highlighted one case in which officers kicked an African-American man in the head while he was handcuffed and on the ground, then did not report having used force during the arrest. “Supervisors throughout the chain of command endorse questionable and sometimes unlawful conduct by officers,” Vanita Gupta, the Justice Department’s top civil rights prosecutor, said in December. “Officers are not provided with adequate training, policy guidance and supervision to do their jobs safely and effectively.” The report was compiled too early to cover the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was playing with a replica gun in a Cleveland park in November when the police shot him. Prosecutors have yet to decide whether to charge officers in his death or in the case of Tanisha Anderson, 37, who died after she was restrained in a prone position on the pavement. Most of the protesters arraigned Monday were charged with refusal to disperse, and 35 pleaded no contest to an amended charge of disorderly conduct, which carries no jail time. Twenty people pleaded not guilty and will contest the charges. More protesters are expected to appear in court on Tuesday. Talis Gage, 31, a Cleveland native now living in a different part of Ohio, was among those who pleaded no contest and was released Monday morning. As with others who pleaded no contest, he was sentenced to time served and was not issued a fine. Mr. Gage said he joined the Saturday protest because he believed that Officer Brelo was guilty of a crime. “What happened was not justice,” Mr. Gage said outside the courthouse shortly after his release. “It was unfair for this man to walk away with no jail time at all.”",

    "source": "Flashes of Cards and of Brilliance as Suárez’s Barcelona Edges Torres’s Atlético <eos> BARCELONA Once upon a time, there was a mercurial forward who played for Liverpool. The forward, Fernando Torres, a Spanish scorer, arrived at that Merseyside club in 2007. He proceeded to score plenty of goals, help Liverpool get agonizingly close to glory and, also, prove to be maddeningly inconsistent from game to game. He left the club in 2011, and not long after, he found himself playing in Spain. Once upon (another) time, there was another mercurial forward who played for Liverpool. The forward, Luis Suárez, a Uruguayan scorer, arrived at the Merseyside club in 2011. He proceeded to score plenty of goals, help Liverpool get agonizingly close — really, really close — to glory and, also, prove to be maddeningly unpredictable in how he behaved on the field. He left the club in 2014, and not long after, he found himself playing in Spain. On Tuesday, in a remarkable display of soccer as mini-biography, Torres and Suárez offered compressed career compilations during the Champions League quarterfinal first leg between Barcelona and Atlético Madrid. First, there was Torres, who managed to look lethargic, brilliant and foolish in the space of just 10 minutes as he slumbered into the game, scored the opening goal and then was sent off well before halftime for a second yellow card. Then there was Suárez, who appeared petulant, threatening, opportunistic, petulant (again) and lethal throughout the match — all while somehow avoiding a red card of his own — before scoring both of his team’s goals as Barcelona beat Atlético, 2-1, at Camp Nou. The return leg is next week in Madrid, though Torres will not take part after he picked up yellow cards for two ill-advised fouls that left the German referee Felix Brych with little choice but to send him walking. English fans (of Liverpool, and Chelsea, too) will forever remember Torres’s fits of brilliance mixed with spells of invisibility, but his performance Tuesday was particularly bizarre: ■ 20th minute: Torres looks largely uninterested, failing to complete several passes and plodding around the field. ■ 25th minute: Torres runs on to a beautiful through pass from Koke and rifles a shot through the legs of Barcelona’s goalkeeper to give Atlético a surprise lead on the road. ■ 29th minute: Torres catches Neymar with his arm, largely unnecessarily, and draws a yellow card. ■ 32nd minute: Torres plays a great pass to Antoine Griezmann that nearly results in a second Atlético goal. ■ 35th minute: Torres runs through the back of Sergio Busquets, who is facing his own goal at the time, and is given a second yellow card and ejected. His departure forces Atlético to play nearly an hour down a man. Diego Simeone, the Atlético manager, was not especially subtle in defending Torres after the match — he hinted in his news conference that Brych had missed many other important decisions — but it was difficult to believe he didn’t understand why Torres was sent off. “I am not saying all that I could say,” Simeone said. Regardless, Torres left early and the game tipped toward Barcelona. Many in the crowd were surely hoping for a different home star to score a meaningful goal; Lionel Messi arrived at the match with 499 career goals for club and country and nearly scored No. 500 with a brilliant overhead kick in the second half. But instead the fans saw a vintage Suárez performance that showcased all of the striker’s risks and rewards. No, there was no biting; Suárez has not trod that path since his third such incident, at the World Cup in Brazil , led to a lengthy suspension. But there were, all the same, flashes of Suárez’s moodiness: He appeared to blatantly kick one Atlético player in the first half, and he put his hands on another in the second period with clear malice. On another night, with another referee, Suárez might have followed Torres up the tunnel early. Instead, he stayed on the field and produced two important goals as Barcelona seeks to become the first club to win consecutive Champions League trophies. In the 63rd minute, Suárez diverted Jordi Alba’s blasted volley — which was going wide — into the net from close range, then raced after the ball and carried it back to the center circle in an effort to get the game restarted as quickly as possible. Nine minutes later, his teammate Dani Alves curled in a sharp cross that Suárez headed powerfully and straight, the ball flying past goalkeeper Jan Oblak and giving Barcelona a deserved victory. “We knew there would be a little space, so I stayed close to the area to convert what I could,” Suárez said afterward. Then, referring to Torres’s red card, he said: “It’s a pity. I would have liked to come back against 11.” Barcelona pushed for another goal — much of the second half resembled a one-sided practice drill, with everyone clustered in front of Atlético’s net — but Simeone’s players held firm as best they could. After Tuesday’s result, they need only win by 1-0 at home next week to advance on the away-goals rule. That was why, at the final whistle, Barcelona’s players did not celebrate. They have the advantage, to be sure, but Atlético is far from beaten. Messi and Neymar pulled up at the final whistle, exhaling before slapping hands and heading toward the locker room. Suárez did the same, clapping toward the Barcelona fans along the way. Even after 90 minutes, he looked primed and focused, as if already thinking about what he might do in the return. Torres, of course, need not bother.",

    "source": "Purple, the Color of a Legal Conniption <eos> UNTIL last week, the urge to punch purple dinosaurs in the face was entirely passé — sort of like wanting to punt Cabbage Patch Dolls or step on Tickle Me Elmo’s windpipe. Such urges, after all, are excusable only when marketing is at its most shrill. (Let it go, man.) But the owners of the Barney character have only themselves to blame if Barney-bashing experiences a renaissance — particularly among denizens of the Internet, for whom the character has been an object of gleefully malevolent parody, off and on, since the early days of the Web. On Wednesday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group based in San Francisco, filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in New York against Lyons Partnership of Allen, Tex., which owns the Barney brand. The group’s aim is to bring an end to what it characterizes as the partnership’s relentless harassment of Web site owners who parody the Barney character, chiefly through threatening cease-and-desist letters from Lyons’s law firm in New York, Gibney, Anthony & Flaherty. In this case, the foundation, along with the Aiken Gump law firm, is representing Stuart Frankel, a musicologist and freelance computer repair technician in New York who maintains a crude, obscure and inarguably minimalist site claiming that Barney is “the enemy” ( dustyfeet.com/evil/enemy.html ). There are, in sum, about 200 cryptic words on the entire page, and two small pictures: one of Barney as he normally appears, and another of Barney defaced, amateurishly, with scribbled-on horns and sharp teeth. •The site has been up, more or less unchanged, Mr. Frankel said, since 1998. And yet, Mr. Frankel has received at least four cease-and-desist notices — with intimations that his Internet service provider might be contacted, or that further “legal remedies” awaited if he did not remove the images — from one of the Gibney lawyers, Matthew W. Carlin, since 2002. The most recent letter came in June. The foundation has answered those letters on Mr. Frankel’s behalf, pointing out in one response to Mr. Carlin in 2002 that parody is “protected expression under the First Amendment and a recognized exception to both copyright and trademark law.” The group also suggested that “making baseless legal threats” was a no-no. A spokesman from Hit Entertainment, the parent company of Lyons Partnership, would say only that the company would not comment on pending litigation. But it’s clear that somewhere in the company’s chain of command, there is a failure to grasp the cultural tides that brought Barney and the Web together in the first place. After all, for all of its success — either as instructive idol or potent child opiate, depending on your point of view — the purple dinosaur exploded onto the American landscape around the same time that the Internet was beginning to permit unprecedented sorts of expression. So as Barney’s signature song “I love you, you love me” (itself, many critics have pointed out, blatantly ripping off the tune to the children’s standard “This Old Man”) reached an unnerving cultural crescendo, there was on hand a brand new medium in which to indulge the reaction — one that permitted crafty sorts to include not just words but defaced images, mocked-up songs, crude interactive games and other fare. Wikipedia, the community-edited online encyclopedia, maintains a useful history of anti-Barney Internet humor — from the “Jihad to Destroy Barney,” which has evolved into a role-playing game, to fictionalized stories and images documenting Barney’s womanizing and crack habit. Of course, the Web was also channeling animosity toward Barney in the offline culture, too. There was heated debate over whether the dinosaur was doling out sound values or peddling a glassy-eyed catechism that merely sedated children. And those without offspring often found the character at best treacly and at worst enraging. In a Massachusetts district court in Worcester in 1994, Deborah McRoy testified that she was wearing a Barney costume outside a local pharmacy when Derrick McMahan suddenly tackled her, knocked her giant dinosaur head off and punched her. The Boston Herald reported that when Ms. McRoy asked him why, she said he replied simply, “Because I hate Barney.” When the San Diego Chicken — another costumed creature — introduced a Barney-like character that he would pummel as part of his routine at sporting events, the Lyons company apparently decided that it had had enough, and sued for trademark violation. In 1998, however, a federal court called the routine a clear parody — and therefore, not only a protected form of speech, but one unlikely to confuse anyone into thinking this was the “real” trademarked Barney. Not long after this decision, Lyons appeared to turn its attention to Web sites that were making unflattering use of Barney’s likeness — once going so far as to send threatening letters to the Electronic Frontier Foundation itself for playing host to some Barney parodies. For his part, Mr. Frankel is unsure if it was the San Diego Chicken or news of some other random assault on Barney that spurred him to create his own Web page, but he insists that he has no malice toward the character — which only adds to the absurdity of the situation. “I was just practicing HTML coding,” Mr. Frankel said, referring to the computer scripting used to create Web pages. He was just learning at the time, he said, back in the late 1990’s, and he thought the reaction to Barney was funny. So he made his little page. By the time Mr. Carlin’s legal letters began arriving several years later, the hostility toward Barney had mostly vanished to the very fringes of the culture — and the Web — and Mr. Frankel said he hadn’t even visited his own site for a very long time. •Odds are, no one else had either. There wouldn’t have been much reason to go there. Now, should a court uphold Mr. Frankel’s rights to parody, the site will be forever enshrined as a victory for free speech, and Lyons will have cast a white hot spotlight onto this demon Barney — and what would otherwise have been a forgotten corner of Internet history — all by itself. Mr. Frankel said that if the company had simply asked nicely in the beginning, he would have just taken the site down. Instead, he suggested, they came at him like a bully. And Mr. Frankel, who said he was among many citizens beaten by overzealous police officers in New York City’s infamous Tompkins Square Park riot of 1988, said he was not about to be pushed around now by Barney’s bullies. “Barney teaches you to ask nicely,” he said. “So they don’t follow Barney’s rules.”",

    "source": "In Ads From Zappos and Others, the Employee Is Getting the Limelight <eos> A POPULAR new reality series on CBS, “Undercover Boss,” shows senior managers working incognito as everyday employees. As for employees who are not secretly C.E.O.’s, they have champions, too, in marketers that are devoting ad campaigns to workers. The latest marketer to join the trend is Zappos, the online retailer that was recently bought by Amazon. In a campaign scheduled to begin on Monday, Zappos will celebrate its customer service representatives, whom the company refers to as the customer loyalty team. The intent is to demonstrate to potential customers — and remind current ones — how the employees make it easy to order or return merchandise, either on Zappos.com or by calling a toll-free number. The campaign, by Mullen in Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies , has a budget estimated at $7 million. The ads reiterate themes that have appeared in previous Zappos campaigns, which include “Powered by service” and “Happy to help. 24/7.” There will be television commercials, print advertisements and video and display ads on Web sites, along with a presence in social media like Facebook and YouTube and on Zappos.com . The ads will also appear in an unusual place where Zappos is already advertising: on the bottoms of plastic bins in airport security lines, reflecting the origins of Zappos as a seller of shoes. The campaign is centered on the interaction during phone calls between Zappos employees and customers. The employees are represented by puppetlike characters who are based on and styled after actual Zappos workers. The characters, called Zappets, resemble Muppets who have been to the theater several times to see “Avenue Q.” The idea is to evoke the offbeat company culture for which Zappos has become known. • The genesis of the campaign was in observations by Mullen executives who, while competing last year in a review for the Zappos account, visited the company’s headquarters in Henderson, Nev., to spend time with the customer service representatives. “We sat with them, and we had headphones on, and we listened to the calls and heard how much of the company’s culture seeped through,” said one of those visitors, Alex Leikikh, managing partner and director for account services at Mullen. Another visitor, Mark Wenneker, managing partner and executive creative director at Mullen, said of the employees: “They would stay on the line for as long as you wanted to talk. They would talk about anything.” According to Aaron Magness, director for brand marketing and business development at Zappos, the approach reflects that “our customer loyalty team is not scripted and is not measured on time of calls.” “The goal is when you see the ads, in TV, print or digital, you’ll say, ‘That’s the Zappos I know,’ ” Mr. Magness said, “or, ‘That’s a company I want to do business with.’ ” Some of the commercials use recordings of calls made to Zappos employees, whose voices are heard in the spots. The words “Actual call with Zappos” appear onscreen. The customer service representatives were not aware that the calls were potential fodder for an ad campaign. The calls heard in those commercials were made by actors or Mullen employees posing as customers, asking tough questions or making unusual requests. For instance, in one commercial, a caller tells a customer service representative that she wants to exchange the Nike workout clothes she previously ordered for another Zappos item. The employee looks up the item and says in a neutral, unruffled voice, “That’s a nice deep fryer.” In another commercial, a caller tells a customer service representative that the dress she ordered the day before has already arrived but that she is “not really emotionally ready for it yet” and has hidden it in the garage under a tarpaulin. When the caller asks if she can return the dress, the employee says yes, then adds gently, “You will have to touch the box, though.” Two other commercials feature the voices of actors playing Zappos employees. In both kinds of commercials, the Zappets onscreen are modeled after actual Zappos customer service representatives. The puppets were built by Randy Carfagno and designed by Lizzi Akana and Aaron Duffy. Mr. Duffy also directed the commercials for a production company in New York, Special Guest. Among the other marketers with employee-centric campaigns are Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor, Lowe’s, Nationwide Insurance, Toyota Motor Sales USA and Verizon. In some instances, like the campaigns for Lowe’s and Nationwide, the employees are portrayed by actors. Some, like Zappos, use a mix of employees and actors. Others use only real workers. • The review for the Zappos account, which ended in September when the company hired Mullen, was one of the strangest that Madison Avenue has witnessed recently. It began with 16 agencies, but after word leaked out about the review, “we ended up getting 190” requests to take part, Mr. Magness said. Of those agencies, 103 submitted material, he added, and about 20 made presentations. Mullen, which was among the 16 original participants, emerged the winner because “we felt a strong connection to Mullen,” Mr. Magness said. As for the scrumlike aspects of the review, Mr. Wenneker said: “The fact there were so many agencies inspired us and made us say, ‘What do we have to do to get this?’ It inspired us to go there, to Henderson.”",

    "source": "At the L.P.G.A. Founders Cup, Tour’s Past Meets Present <eos> PHOENIX — After her second shot on the first hole bounced on the fringe of the green and stopped rolling within a foot of the cup, Shirley Spork seemed pleased. “I still have the short game,” she said. Spork , 83, has more than just a short game. Last May on her birthday, she shot her age. Spork is one of the 13 original members of the L.P.G.A. On Thursday, she played in the pro-am of this weekend’s Founders Cup , partnered with Mike Whan, the L.P.G.A. commissioner, at the Wildfire Golf Club. The tournament honors the organization’s beginnings and features appearances by Spork and the two of the other four surviving founders, Louise Suggs and Marilynn Smith. The others, Marlene Bauer and Bettye Danoff, are not attending. “I want to show the women coming up that all this just didn’t happen at once,” Spork said. “I have to give them the history of how we got here.” The Founders Cup is unique among official L.P.G.A. tournaments, and a vast majority of other professional sporting events, in that the entire $1 million purse will go not to the players but to charity: $500,000 to the organization’s program for girls and the rest to charities selected by the top 10 finishers. Golfers will still earn rankings points, and the results will be reflected in the money list. The tournament will also donate $100 for each birdie and $500 for each eagle made on the last four holes to the U.S. Fund for Unicef’s Japan relief efforts. A few players expressed skepticism about the format early on, Whan said, but he added, “No one has ever questioned the idea of playing for charity.” Cristie Kerr, who is ranked No. 5 in the world, said, “I think the players just wanted more details and wanted to find out where the money is going.” For Spork, every tee box is a reminder of the beginnings of the L.P.G.A. Thirteen of the course’s holes are named for the founders, and on each is a large and white black-and-white photograph of the player. The banners offered Spork a teaching opportunity. On the Patty Berg-designated second hole, she pulled aside M. J. Hur, another of her pro-am playing partners, to tell her about Berg’s life and golf swing. “She has so many good stories,” Hur, 21, said, smiling. “When I see her, I’m viewing the history of the L.P.G.A.” Spork, who finished second in the L.P.G.A. Championship in 1962, has teed up for thousands of rounds of golf in her 71 years of playing. At 11, she bought her first club, a putter, for $1. She caddied at courses in Detroit, her hometown, and later became a master teacher and landed in the L.P.G.A. Teachers Hall of Fame. Spork turned professional in 1950 with the help of Babe Didrikson Zaharias , a pioneering athlete in women’s golf, basketball and track and field. Spork recalled asking Didrikson Zaharias how to move beyond her amateur status. She said Didrikson Zaharias leaned over, tapped Spork on the head and said, “There, kid, you’re a pro.” Spork has had knee and hip replacements in recent years. She pointed to body parts during Thursday’s round, giving a timeline for each procedure. “That knee, eight years ago,” she said. “This hip, that was six years ago.” If there were an L.P.G.A. Mount Rushmore, Spork and her fellow founder Smith would be chiseled on it. They were instrumental in the birth of the organization in 1950. In those days a small band of women barnstormed in caravans from tournament to tournament, the cars crammed with clothes and clubs. Riders in the lead car used colored table tennis paddles to signal those behind. When a certain colored paddle was held out a window, it was time to stop for gas; another meant a stop to eat; yet another, a bathroom break. The women did their own promotions. One night in 1951, Spork and Smith attended a boxing match in Landover, Md., to promote the National Open being held there. Smith was scheduled to address the audience between bouts, but she never made it into the ring. “We had front row seats and the sweat was flying and blood was squirting out,” Spork said. “Marilynn got woozy from seeing the blood and couldn’t go on. I climbed through the ropes, grabbed the microphone and told them about the L.P.G.A. and come on out and see us play. We didn’t get booed, and I think some came out to see us.” Another promotion involved showing up at small-town minor league baseball games. Standing near home plate, the women arched 9-iron shots into center field. “We had an item to sell, which was ourselves and our talent,” Spork said. Rolling into a town, they asked business owners to place posters in their windows to advertise a tournament. They popped in on Lions Club and Kiwanis meetings. There was no television coverage then, and only the occasional radio interview. When a tournament concluded, one player was designated to call in scores to the newspapers before the caravan left for the next event. As Spork watched Hur drive a ball down the center of the fairway, she recalled a time when the women adjusted their skirts and hit the ball as far as they could — though rarely as far as Hur’s drives. “These young ladies are hitting from the men’s tees and most are hitting 6-irons and wedges for their second shots,” Spork said. “We were never in that position. If we had their equipment and their trainers and time to build our energy, we would have been able to hit the ball that way.” After the round, Whan said the best part of his day was listening to Spork pass along her knowledge of the organization’s early years. “Sometimes we go from tournament to tournament forgetting how it all started,” he said. With the golf over, Spork melted into her second favorite sport: storytelling. Between sips of lemonade and iced tea, she recalled becoming the first female club pro at the Tamarisk Country Club in Rancho Mirage, Calif., where she gave lessons to a number of luminaries, including Harpo Marx, Danny Kaye, Nat King Cole and Walter Annenberg, the media tycoon and philanthropist. “He was left-handed and looped the club at the top of his swing,” Spork said of Annenberg. “Every time I saw him I’d say, ‘Hey there, Zorro!’ ” Spork moved to another tale about another player. “And then there’s the one of the golfer who was on a tee, sneezed and both her contacts popped out!” STANFORD LEADS BY THREE Angela Stanford opened a three-stroke lead over Brittany Lincicome in the Founders Cup, shooting her second straight six-under 66.

    "source": "At First, Fireworks Over the Umpiring <eos> ARLINGTON, Tex. The ball bounced to Elvis Andrus so neatly that Albert Pujols, the runner at first base, peeled off halfway to second. This was as routine as a double-play ball can be. Until it wasn’t. Ian Kinsler, the Texas Rangers second baseman who had earlier made his second error of the World Series, threw high to first baseman Mike Napoli. Matt Holliday, who had hit the ball for the St. Louis Cardinals , could have slid into first to avoid the tag. But he stayed upright, allowing Napoli to whirl and tag him on the shoulder, a step before he crossed the base. Yet Holliday was ruled safe, and he went on to score the first run of a four-run rally in the fourth inning of the Cardinals’ rollicking 16-7 victory in Game 3 at Rangers Ballpark. Pujols made himself the story, tying single-game World Series records for hits, homers and runs batted in. But the blown call at first was a discouraging reminder that baseball can, and should, make the game better. It took a few seconds for people to notice that the first-base umpire, Ron Kulpa, is a St. Louis native. Before the inning was over, someone had updated Kulpa’s Wikipedia page to note that he had made “the worst call in Major League Baseball history.” Well, about that. Kulpa is the same umpire who did a terrific job in Game 2 when he accurately called Kinsler safe at second on a critical steal in the ninth inning. No Cardinals bias there. And it was not Kulpa — and certainly not an incoming base runner, either — who caused Kinsler’s bad throw. After watching a replay, Kulpa acknowledged that he made the wrong call. “I had him on the base at the time of his tag,” he said. “I had a tag, but I had him on the base.” Still, this was not even the most egregious call at first base in a Cardinals World Series game. In the ninth inning of Game 6 in 1985, with St. Louis trying to close out a championship in Kansas City, the umpire Don Denkinger called Jorge Orta safe at first. The Royals capitalized on that mistake, and subsequent blunders by the Cardinals, to win the game and then the series. Denkinger has lived in infamy for that call, never mind his work behind the plate six years later, in Jack Morris’s Game 7 masterpiece. History recalls Denkinger as the goat, just like Steve Bartman, the Cubs fan who interfered with a foul ball in Game 6 of the 2003 National League Championship Series. Bartman had nothing to do with the Cubs’ wretched play that immediately followed, but he wears the horns. We do not know if the Rangers will recover to win the World Series and make Kulpa a footnote. Whatever happens, he deserves no blame. The Rangers’ pitching crumbled and the Cardinals’ offense rumbled. Napoli made a two-run throwing error in the top of the fourth, and with a better slide in the bottom of the inning, he might have scored on Kinsler’s fly out to left. This loss was squarely on the Rangers, but Kulpa’s mistake highlights a problem baseball faces every postseason. Missed calls are part of every game, all season long. But they are magnified with increased coverage and viewership. Umpires take a bruising in October, especially with virtual strike zones shown on the screen throughout some playoff games. Commissioner Bud Selig has said he supports that kind of technology, which is to his credit, because it enhances the viewer’s experience. Yet Selig has proceeded too cautiously with instant replay. Since late in the 2008 season, baseball has used instant replay only for boundary calls associated with home runs. Plays on the bases are exempt, even though they, too, could be reviewed the same way. Selig and Joe Torre, baseball’s executive vice president for on-field operations, have said that more instant replay could make games even longer, a legitimate concern. But there has to be a way. Maybe, for the postseason, an umpiring supervisor could be stationed in the press box — or, better yet, the broadcast truck, with instant access to every camera angle. If a call on the bases is clearly wrong, the supervisor could communicate with the plate umpire before the next at-bat begins. The game deserves better, especially in the postseason, with so much at stake. The umpires deserve better, too. A mistake by a player cannot be reversed by technology. A mistake by an umpire can, if baseball would allow it. In any case, a team that allows 16 runs has no business winning, and in the warm air of their bandbox ballpark, the Rangers were helpless against the best offense in the National League. The Rangers have worked to reverse the stereotype in their DNA as a franchise that must slug its way to win. They won with defense, pitching and heady base running in Game 2 at Busch Stadium, but this was the kind of game they played a decade ago: lots of runs for the Rangers, but lots more for the opposition. As a result of that, not of a bad call by Kulpa, the Rangers find themselves in the same spot as they were against the San Francisco Giants a year ago. They are trailing in the World Series, two games to one, with two more games at home. They lost them both last season and watched the Giants celebrate at their park.",

    "source": "Genentech Urges Its Shareholders to Rebuff Roche <eos> Genentech urged its shareholders on Monday to reject a hostile takeover offer from the company’s majority owner, Roche. In a letter to shareholders, a committee of Genentech’s directors said that Roche’s offer of $86.50 a share substantially undervalued the company, given its track record of developing new biotechnology drugs. And the committee accused Roche of being “consistently dismissive” of efforts to negotiate a deal. The action was expected because the same board committee had rejected an offer of $89 a share that Roche made last July for the 44 percent of Genentech it does not own. Roche early this month began a tender offer at the lower price of $86.50 a share in cash, saying it was dissatisfied with the pace of negotiations since the rejection last summer. The new offer is worth about $42.1 billion in total, down from $43.7 billion for the original offer. In a statement issued Monday, Roche said it would now be up to the shareholders to decide on its tender offer. The offer is scheduled to end March 12, although Roche can extend it. It might be a hard deal to pull off at $86.50. In a survey of 59 Genentech shareholders by Citigroup this month, 92 percent said they would not tender shares at that price. Citigroup said investors appeared willing to accept an offer of $97 a share. The dynamic is expected to change in mid-April, when results are supposed to be available from a clinical trial testing Genentech’s cancer drug Avastin for a new use — as a treatment for colorectal cancer after surgical removal of the tumor. If the trial is successful, analysts say, Genentech’s stock, which closed Monday at $84.55, might rise to $100 and put a deal out of reach for Roche. If the test fails, analysts say the stock might drop below $70 and Roche’s offer would be much more attractive. Roche recently sold $16 billion in bonds to help finance the transaction. In a lengthy filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Genentech gave its side of the negotiations with Roche since July. The two companies have argued over whether Genentech’s long-term forecast of its business success was too optimistic. That forecast projects Genentech’s revenue rising to $38.8 billion in 2024, from about $14 billion expected this year. Based on that projection, Genentech’s special board committee, consisting of the three directors who are not employees of either Genentech or Roche, proposed a price of $112 a share. Genentech will meet with investors in New York next Monday to discuss its prospects. “Over the past seven months, the special committee persistently attempted to work constructively with Roche and we were consistent in our stated willingness to negotiate toward a price that recognizes the full value of Genentech,” the committee said in its letter to shareholders. The filing also revealed that Roche began preparing for an acquisition after Genentech had rebuffed its request to amend the relationship between the two companies to make it easier for Roche to increase its stake in Genentech by buying Genentech shares in the open market.",

    "source": "Giants’ Tuck Is Fined for Hit on Cowboys’ Bollinger <eos> EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Justin Tuck was fined $7,500 by the N.F.L. for his roughing-the-passer penalty last Sunday on Brooks Bollinger. “Our job description is basically to destroy a quarterback, but you’ve got to pick and choose how to do it,” said Tuck, who said he would appeal the fine. Tuck was penalized in the third quarter of a 35-14 victory against the Dallas Cowboys for tackling Bollinger as Bollinger threw an incompletion. “You can’t hit him in the head, you can’t hit him below the knees,” Tuck said. “Obviously, you can’t hit him hard, either.” Tuck was penalized for landing on Bollinger with the full force of his 274 pounds. According to Randall Liu, information manager for the National Football Conference, Tuck was fined because “he unnecessarily drove the opposing quarterback to the ground.” He said Tuck’s actions violated Rule 12, Section 2, Article 12(2) of the N.F.L.’s official rules. In an e-mail message, Liu said the fine was issued by Gene Washington, the league’s director of football operations. The league has emphasized protection of quarterbacks against rough play to prevent injury, but Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said he did not think the play was worth calling a penalty. “No, it was not,” Coughlin said Monday. “On the spot, the official thought it was. The guy was attacking the quarterback. He doesn’t have a checklist that he goes through. It is foolish to continue dialogue about this because it doesn’t settle anything.” EXTRA POINTS James Butler, the Giants strong safety who has a knee injury, practiced on a limited basis Thursday. “He did some work,” Coach Tom Coughlin said, “but not a whole lot, to be honest with you.” Sammy Knight is listed as Butler’s backup.",

    "source": "House-Hunting in Hong Kong With the App That Sees Dead People <eos> HONG KONG — Ship Street is quintessentially Hong Kong, even serving as the backdrop to several local movies. There is a well-preserved three-story building from the 1920s, now a cigar lounge. Next door is a towering glass-and-steel apartment complex. There is a New York-style pizzeria, a pastry shop and a mom-and-pop hardware store. But when viewed through a smartphone camera, Ship Street can look downright creepy. Building on the success of Pokémon Go , a local company has created a smartphone app that superimposes property listings on street views. Point your phone at a building and the units for rent or sale pop up, complete with prices. But on occasion, cartoon ghosts appear next to an apartment tower, representing an unnatural or unexplained death that took place there. In Hong Kong, this is a big deal. Many people believe that living in a place where someone committed suicide or, worse, was murdered, brings all sorts of bad fortune. Those units, even years after such a death occurred, are discounted around 20 percent, sometimes 50 percent if the death was particularly gruesome. Real estate is a topic that dominates dinner conversations, newspaper headlines and career choices here. Asif Ghafoor, a transplant from London whose company, Spacious , created the search tool, said Hong Kongers looking for a place to live asked the same questions as people anywhere: Is it near the subway? How is the view? Is there a gym? The app has filters for all of those things. But there is one other question that Mr. Ghafoor found to be just as important, if not more so: Is it haunted? On and around Ship Street, in the Wan Chai neighborhood of Hong Kong, terse captions under the ghosts tell a sad tale. In one complex, “a man in his 60s jumped off the building.” At another: “Single male burnt charcoal,” referring to carbon monoxide poisoning, a common method of suicide here. Mr. Ghafoor said the captions mirrored, as closely as possible, deaths that had been reported in local newspapers or by the police. Most of the ghosts seem to refer to suicides; Hong Kong has one of the lowest homicide rates in the world. But Ship Street is also where the city’s highest-profile murders occurred in recent years: the killings of two Indonesian women by a British banker in the fall of 2014, on the 31st floor of the glass-and-steel J Residence . Mr. Ghafoor said that, on average, 1 to 2 percent of apartments for sale have had an “incident,” and that as a result, they sell at a discount of up to 20 percent. For Jin Peh , a feng shui teacher and the author of “ Feng Shui: A Hong Kong Perspective ,” a property below market price is a bad sign rather than a bargain. He recommends avoiding living where an unnatural death has occurred. In general, the principles of feng shui relate to the flow of energies in nature. An unnatural death can cause excess negative energy, Mr. Peh said in a telephone interview. The consequences of this depend on your personal beliefs, he said, but for traditional Chinese, the worst-case scenario is becoming “possessed” by the spirit or ghost. He recalled friends of friends who started hearing voices shortly after moving into an apartment. The voices told them to jump from the building — which is how the previous occupant ended his life. “Maybe they are just being delusional,” Mr. Peh said, “but they hear voices trying to persuade them to repeat the same mistake.” In less extreme cases, the tenants’ well-being will suffer: They will become more prone to emotional issues, mood swings and depression, he said. Sometimes, the circumstances surrounding a death are so grim that it affects the value of entire floors or buildings. For 13 years, the site of Hong Kong’s gruesome “Hello Kitty” murder remained abandoned. In 1999, Fan Man-yee, a nightclub hostess, was kidnapped by three men and held hostage in an apartment in a multistory building. The men tortured her for more than a month until she died. Her body was dismembered, and her skull was found inside a giant Hello Kitty doll. Image The Spacious app shows J Residence as haunted. The perpetrators were sentenced to life in prison . The apartment was vacant for years. No one would rent it. No one would buy it. They said it was haunted . In 2012, the entire building was finally demolished. Mr. Ghafoor said that while there was no hard and fast rule that real estate agents must tell prospective buyers or renters about unnatural deaths, the local regulator has a code of conduct that says agents must serve their clients with “honesty, fidelity and integrity.” Real estate companies keep close tabs on supposedly haunted properties. One site, Squarefoot.com, maintains a macabre list . Banks are reluctant to provide mortgages for such properties, meaning sellers have to find buyers willing to pay cash. That makes the discount almost self-fulfilling: All-cash transactions command a discount here because of the small number of people who don’t need a mortgage. For those who are not superstitious — real estate agents point to expatriates and young people — moving into a “haunted” home can take some of the sting out of buying or renting in Hong Kong, the city with the least affordable housing in the world . “I’ve started looking and found it’s insanely expensive in this city,” says Harry Edwards, 27, a lawyer who recently moved to Hong Kong from Australia. On a recent day, he was wandering around the trendy neighborhood of Sheung Wan, trying out the Spacious app. He said he didn’t subscribe to superstitions “whatsoever.” “I actually think it would be great to say, ‘I live in a haunted house,’ ” he said. There are many to choose from. A quick wave of the app in Hong Kong’s North Point neighborhood reveals a world of tragedy. The little white ghosts pop up next to many of the area’s towering apartment complexes. In one, a part-time tennis trainer “killed and stabbed his wife after an argument, jumped off the building.” In another: “Female drowned herself in bathtub.” Next door: “Old male jumped off the building.” Even some people who might benefit from higher home prices acknowledge the power of superstition here. After more than 30 years in the real estate business, Lily Wong, a local agent, knows that most Chinese clients are not interested in even looking at haunted apartments. “They wouldn’t rent, they wouldn’t buy,” she said. She counts herself among that group. “I can’t stay in a flat that they said is haunted,” she said. “It’s so creepy.”",

    "source": "Oil Prices Bounce Back After a $10 Decline <eos> Oil prices swung higher Tuesday, recovering from the previous day’s plunge as edgy investors trickled back into the market on hopes that Congress would resurrect a failed financial bailout plan . Light, sweet crude for November delivery rose $4.27, or 4.4 percent, to settle at $100.64 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Monday, prices fell $10.52, to settle at $96.37 — the second-largest drop ever in dollar terms — after House legislators rejected the $700 billion bailout, stunning investors and raising fears of a long economic crisis that could sharply curb global energy demand. Crude has fallen about $25, or 20 percent, in the last seven days. Some recovery was to be expected after Monday’s fall, and analysts said prices would probably remain in a holding pattern until the fate of the financial rescue plan was determined. Lawmakers were expected to reconvene in Washington on Thursday, though it was unclear if they would try another vote on the bailout. Whether or not there is any agreement on a United States bailout, oil market watchers say global financial tremors have already forced consumers and businesses to scale back energy consumption, a trend that could take prices lower in coming weeks. ”Oil is going to have a tough time getting back over $100 and staying there,” said Matt Zeman, head commodities trader at LaSalle Futures in Chicago. ”Even if the bailout gets done, it’s not going to solve everything immediately. The slowdown will have to work itself out for demand to take off again.” Weaker demand for fuel continues to weigh on prices at the pump.

    "source": "Lawyers Use Humor to Plead Case <eos> THE adage about encountering the scene of a car accident — you don’t want to look, but can’t look away — may also apply to commercials for lawyers who represent victims of those accidents. YouTube users have posted many disturbingly riveting lawyer ads from recent history, like those from the 1990s featuring Jim “The Hammer” Shapiro, a personal injury lawyer in Rochester, N.Y., who, as video of vehicles exploding and other mayhem played on the screen, balled up a fist and shouted: “Hurt? I cannot rip out the hearts of those who hurt you! I cannot hand you their severed heads! But I can hunt them down and settle the score!” While few lawyer ads are as overstated as Mr. Shapiro’s, which have attracted more than 100,000 views on YouTube, many share their modest production values, wooden delivery and the incongruity of bookish litigators trying to channel Chuck Norris. Other common approaches feature lawyers speaking more conversationally in front of shelves of law books, or former clients describing horrific accidents and how legal judgments brought them justice. One thing that the ads do not generally feature, at least not intentionally, is an element of humor, which is what makes new television commercials for the New York law firm of Trolman, Glaser & Lichtman noteworthy. In one ad, by the Levinson Tractenberg Group, an independent agency in Manhattan, an actress in her 30s sitting at a kitchen table says, “The pain was excruciating: It’s like I had this huge, really sharp machete chopping down on me every time I tried to move.” She continues, “It was the worst paper cut I ever had — they made that paper way too sharp.” Raising a hand to reveal a bandage on her index finger, she concludes, “Someone has to pay.” The tagline, “There are some cases even we can’t win,” appears on the screen, and a voiceover concludes, “If you’ve been injured, call us, but keep in mind: you really need to be injured.” In another spot, an actor, also in his 30s, describes being in the middle of the best video game of his life when, here tears begin streaming down his cheeks, the power went off. “My game was lost,” he says. “I never thought the power company would do this to me. I have pain and suffering.” As he sobs, the tagline appears, “There are some cases even we can’t win.” Joel Levinson, a partner in the Levinson Tractenberg Group, said he and partner Joel Tractenberg told the lawyers at the outset that they wanted to deviate from the norm. “We said if you’re looking to be in the ads, and they’d taken that approach before, then we’re not interested,” Mr. Levinson said. “But if you want to go beyond the traditional spokesperson type of ad, we said, you have an opportunity to break through the clutter.” As a lawyer, Mr. Lichtman said he was pleased to be the source of a joke rather than the butt of one. “The approach recognizes that there is this quote-unquote skepticism associated with litigation in general,” Mr. Lichtman said. “It’s saying to the public that we understand that we’re a litigious society, No. 1, and, No. 2, we understand that litigiousness is food for a joke. But we also recognize there’s an importance to having access to the court system if there has been an injustice.” Unlike previous spots for the firm, which tended to appear at night, the new ads appear on New York stations in daytime shows like “Good Morning America” and “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.” New print ads in New York subways and on buses are more serious, yet also avoid cliché images like gavels and scales of justice. One says, “When you get hit by a car your whole family feels the impact,” and another, “We have yet to find a cane that can support a family of five.” Ads for lawyers, including those in the Yellow Pages, are a relatively modern phenomenon. Both the national and state bar associations prohibited the practice until 1977, when the Supreme Court ruled that such advertising was entitled to First Amendment protection. Bar associations feared that ads would demean the legal profession, a fear borne out by ads in which lawyers promised they would not charge a dime until you won your money. “They just do not scream professionalism,” said Kevin Underhill, a San Francisco lawyer who publishes Lowering the Bar ( loweringthebar.net ), a legal humor blog. “It’s desperate aggression that you see in those late-night ads. They are cheaply made and poorly edited.” Mr. Underhill says he derives perverse pleasure from ads that test the boundaries of taste, like print ads where Alison B. Margolin, a Los Angeles lawyer, proclaims she is “L.A.’s Dopest Attorney” for those who “want to smoke pot on probation,” and a Chicago billboard sponsored by Fetman, Garland & Associates, which specializes in divorce cases, that read: “Life’s short. Get a divorce.” Allan Ripp, a New York publicist who represents many law firms, viewed the Trolman, Glaser & Lichtman ads and was asked to comment on them. “They’re ads that seem at first like they could have been written by a tort reform group that goes after the plaintiff’s bar for pursuing trivial or unsound cases,” Mr. Ripp said. “But what they’re really doing is poking fun at the rest of the firms that go after frivolous cases and saying, ‘But we’re selective and meritorious.’ It’s very clever, and a real departure from traditional lawyer advertising, and it deserves to be emulated.”",

    "source": "For Many, Thrift Shops Are a Wardrobe Essential <eos> SHEENA MASSIE, dragged by her mother to garage and estate sales as a child, once cringed at the sight of used goods. “The very thought of being caught by my peers buying other people’s junk was mortifying,” said Ms. Massie, a 25-year-old waitress in Canal Winchester, Ohio, near Columbus. “If someone else didn’t want it, why would I?” But, like Ms. Massie, who with her mother is opening a thrift shop, more consumers are concluding that brand new is not necessarily better. According to the National Association of Resale and Thrift Shops, the industry is growing at a rate of 5 percent a year. And as the prices of gasoline and groceries edge higher and debt — be it mortgage or credit card — weighs more heavily, saving money on clothes, shoes and household goods has become increasingly essential for many people. “With the economy in its current condition, I think people will begin turning to more thrifty ways of shopping,” said Ms. Massie, whose store, Thrift on the Canal, opens next month. “We want everyone that shops with us to enjoy the same thrill we do when we go thrifting.” The thrift shop association estimates that there are 25,000 such stores in the United States. Britt Beemer, the founder and chief executive of America’s Research Group, a consumer behavior research firm, said surveys have found that 16 to 18 percent of Americans shop in thrift stores, while 12 to 15 percent visit consignment stores. “Thrift shops are not on the radar screen for many shoppers,” Mr. Beemer said. He predicted that more would turn to them, especially for back-to-school clothing. TheThriftShopper.com , a two-year-old Web site, is viewed 70,000 times a day, mostly by women age 30 to 50, said Mike Gold, who runs the site with his wife, Julie. Mr. Gold said he discovered that thrift shop fans are everywhere when he met the auctioneers and experts of “The Antiques Roadshow,” a popular PBS series. “Every single one of them was an avid thrift shopper,” he said. Ms. Gold added, “One said she even buys her clothes there.” Kara Lake, a 34-year-old mother in Braintree, Vt., who is home-schooling her five children, ages 8, 7, 6, 3 and 6 months, said she was one of those fans, particularly since a tight budget is normal. She said she grew up in rural Vermont wearing thrift shop clothing and “can count on two hands when I’ve bought something new.” Because many families have only one or two children, she said, the clothing is only gently used. “We can still give our kids the best things.” Ms. Lake said she easily found clothes with labels like Old Navy, the Gap and Banana Republic. “It doesn’t make any sense to me to buy anything brand new if the clothes are well taken care of.” She also finds clothes for herself from midpriced labels like Ann Taylor and J. Jill, shopping twice a month and spending, in all, $15 to $20 for an armful of clothing for herself and several of her children. Consignment shops, which typically have higher prices but offer higher-end or designer merchandise, have their fans as well. Clothing must be washed or dry cleaned before sale, and the selection in such shops tends to be more carefully edited. Mason Bechtel, a retired administrative assistant for a major financial services firm in Houston, grew up choosing between having several new dresses each season from Loehmann’s, a discount store, or just one from Bonwit Teller. “I realized that shopping at the best shops, I felt stupid,” she said. “Why pay $120 for a dress I could find in a resale shop?” Ms. Bechtel, whose mother ran a Lilly Pulitzer shop in Westport, Conn., admits to having expensive, if classic taste. “I still wear the same clothes from the same shops — but I usually pay nothing more than $20.” Thrift and consignment shoppers love getting a bargain. For Ms. Bechtel, it was a $25 Black Watch plaid blazer with a black velvet collar and $25 for a St. John knit suit — new, typically costing four figures. Julie Gold, a co-owner of TheThriftShopper.com, said buying used clothing takes more diligence than simply rifling the racks at a local retailer. “In a thrift store, you really have to dig,” she said. “It takes a lot of time, energy and patience.” But, thrift shoppers say, the time demanded is repaid with single-digit price tags and a wide variety of styles in one place. Two national chains, Buffalo Exchange and Crossroads Trading Company, allow shoppers to bring in clothes they no longer want for cash or to trade for clothes in the store. Both promote their fashionable offerings, in an attempt to appeal to younger shoppers. And both offer a combination of new and what they term “recycled” clothes. “A lot of the neighborhood men who shop in our store are very style-conscious,” said Mary Dalton, the manager of a Crossroads store near the Castro district in San Francisco. “They can recycle their clothing and not wear it into the ground. Sustainable businesses are becoming more trendy, so people are more open to it.” Prices, she said, range from $6 to $75, and popular jeans like Diesel or G Star cost $50 to $65 a pair compared with a regular retail price that can be double or triple that. “People will get three or four garments for the price of one,” she said. “We get all kinds of customers, from an attorney who needs work clothes to the college-age hipster. The age range is very, very wide.” Consumers can also make money by selling or donating clothing or household goods to thrift and consignment shops. Donations can offer a tax deduction, while selling items that are worth more than you paid, can make consigning lucrative, Ms. Massie said. “I once found a vintage Carlton Ware money box for $2.50 and made a $45 profit and a pair of Ruehl jeans for $9.99 that I sold for $60. I know of a lady who bought a necklace for $3.50, and it was a diamond over one carat worth over $8,000. “That’s why I shop in thrift stores.”",

    "source": "After Bear Is Caught in Montclair, Students Are Allowed Outside <eos> The warning sent by school officials on Tuesday morning seemed more suited for the Alaskan wild than the bustling suburb of Montclair, N.J.: All outdoor activities were suspended because a black bear was lurking about. Throughout Monday and into Tuesday, reports about the bear’s activities were posted online and reported to the police. The bear was in a backyard, looking bored. It was up a tree, looking reflective. It was in the street, looking sad. The animal even made it near a Whole Foods market, where he was spotted looking confused. State officials were called in to help, and when the bear was seen near an elementary school on Monday afternoon, the word went out to keep those children inside. The warning was later expanded to include children from the entire district. “The Montclair Police Department has notified us that there have been bear citings in Montclair: yesterday near the Montclair Art Museum and this morning, near Edgemont School,” Penny MacCormack, the school superintendent, said in a note sent out Tuesday morning, which included the misused “citings.” “As a precaution, we are suspending all outside activities at all of our elementary and middle schools.” After each reported sighting, police and wildlife officials rushed to the scene to blare air horns and make other loud noises in an attempt to drive the bear in the direction of the Mills Reservation on the northern edge of town. “He was never in a confrontational mode,” said Lt. Angel Roman Jr. of the Montclair Police Department. The plan to coerce the bear to take refuge in the unpopulated nature reserve failed, but on Tuesday morning, the animal was spotted in a tree in Watchung Park and quickly cornered by the authorities. “We kept him up in the tree by making noise,” Lieutenant Roman said. The police sealed off the park with yellow tape to keep a crowd of residents with cameras from getting too close to the bear. Monica Minore, who has an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old in a local elementary school, said she had been organizing an outdoor run for children to raise money to build a roof for a school in Africa when the notice went out that all outdoor activities had been canceled. Image A police lieutenant said the young black bear was probably hungry, lost and just as scared as the people who spotted it. Credit Selma Avdicevic/ baristanet.com “The bear story has taken over town,” she said. “I have been getting all these e-mails from mothers talking about it.” She saw the bear shortly after the notice, watching as the police tried to keep it in the tree. “The poor bear was just sitting in the tree with like a hundred people looking at him,” she said. “The police were banging on the tree with clubs until animal control got there.” There was a helicopter circling overhead, orange cones and police tape strung up, she said, and a general carnival atmosphere. “He was just hanging out on the branch looking a little concerned,” she said of the bear, which was not very far off the ground. Around 9 a.m., two hours after the bear was first spotted, officials from the Division of Fish and Wildlife arrived and shot it with a tranquilizer gun, officials said. The black bear, estimated to be 18 months old, weighed 158 pounds. The bear was tagged and tattooed for identification, and will be released on state land, officials said. Lieutenant Roman said that in his 21 years with the department, he did not recall a time when children had been kept indoors because of a bear threat. He noted that the bear — young, hungry and most likely lost — was probably just as scared as the people who spotted it. After the situation was resolved, school officials said children would be allowed to go play outside again. “We are happy to report that the bear sighted this morning has been caught,” Ms. MacCormack wrote. “All students and staff are safe to resume regular outdoor activities.” Ms. MacCormack said that “in our haste to get the bear emergency e-mail out to the public this morning,” they made a grammatical error, misusing the word citing for sighting. “We regret this error,” she said, “and trust that it did not overshadow the importance of the communication.”",

    "source": "Mets Fight Back From a Dismal Outing , but Fall in 13 <eos> For much of the season, Johan Santana has been an effective pitcher punished by a lack of hitting support. But on Wednesday, when Santana had one of the worst performances of his career, the Mets rallied to erase an early six-run deficit against the St. Louis Cardinals . They pushed the game into extra innings, but the Cardinals got a run-scoring single from Albert Pujols off Pedro Feliciano in the 13th and beat the Mets, 8-7, at Citi Field. Carlos Beltran hit a solo home run, and Angel Pagan had a two-run blast. Mike Hessman had a two-run double in the first inning, and Ike Davis had a two-run single as a pinch-hitter in the eighth to tie the score at 7-7. Santana, who had been 3-0 in July, allowed six runs and eight hits in the first inning, each total the worst in his career for a first inning. The 13 hits were also a career worst in a game for Santana, who left with two outs in the sixth. The first two Cardinals runs came on a two-out home run to left by Matt Holliday. The Mets cut the lead to 6-2 in the bottom of the inning on a bases-loaded double by Hessman off Jaime Garcia. The Mets pulled within four runs again in the sixth inning when Beltran hit his first home run of the season, to left field, to make the score, 7-3. In the four-run eighth, Pagan’s two-run home run cut the lead to 7-5 before Davis singled home two runs to tie the game. Despite the disappointing defeat, many Mets stressed the spirit of the comeback. “It was a great, great comeback by the whole team,” Beltran said. “But we fell short.” Several players and Manager Jerry Manuel mentioned how Santana settled down and gave the team four scoreless innings after the disastrous first. “My mind-set was stay aggressive, stay in the game,” Santana said. “I had to go as deep as I could.” But David Wright expressed the bittersweet aftertaste. “We kind of ran out of steam, out of gas,” Wright said. “Moral victories don’t count in the standings. We couldn’t get that one hit to put us over the top.” Hessman was a curious echo of another Met, Fernando Tatis, a veteran major-leaguer who once hit two grand slam home runs in the same inning off the same pitcher, Chan Ho Park. Tatis, a part-time first baseman, is now on the disabled list. Hessman, another part-time first baseman, also holds a quirky statistic. On Sept. 8, 2008, while playing with the Detroit Tigers, Hessman was hit twice in the same inning by pitches thrown by the same pitcher, Oakland’s Gio Gonzalez. Later in that game, Hessman hit a home run off a different pitcher, Jeff Gray, one of 13 home runs Hessman had hit in 78 previous major league games with three teams since 2003 (including his debut as a Met as a pinch-hitter in Tuesday’s 8-2 victory). Hessman had a better recollection of a pitch that hit him this season when he played for Class AAA Buffalo; it broke his right hand and idled him for six weeks. Despite the layoff, Hessman hit 18 home runs with Buffalo. At age 32, Hessman is the leader in minor league home runs among active players with 329. Because he has power and because the Mets need some, Hessman was used as a replacement for Davis at first base. Manuel said he hoped to use Hessman at third base soon to give David Wright a day of rest. But his new home park can discourage even established home-run hitters. One of them is Jason Bay, the left fielder, who has hit only six home runs and was out again for the second day with post-concussion symptoms. “You’ve got to pick and choose when you can get aggressive,” Hessman said. “This looks like a stadium where you try to stay line-drive conscious and hit balls into the gaps, and hopefully you get your homers on the road.” Hessman’s first-inning double, on an 0-2 pitch from Garcia, hit the left-field wall. He missed a grand slam by only a few feet. Because Hessman has played since 1996 in mostly minor league towns, he is sometimes compared to Crash Davis, the fictional and world-weary minor-league veteran in “Bull Durham.” The comparison amused catcher Josh Thole and the utility man Chris Carter, both of whom played this season in Buffalo with Hessman. “Just because he’s a veteran guy and knows the ropes of the International League, I don’t think that makes him Crash Davis,” Thole said. Carter said Hessman is similar to the movie character in one respect: “He’s Crash Davis because he hits home runs, but he’s not anything like Crash Davis off the field,” adding that Hessman hits to all fields and hits well in the clutch. “He’s a guy that scares pitchers,” Carter said. Sometimes, players like Hessman are characterized as “4-A players,” too good for Class AAA but not quite good enough to stick with a major league team. “I’m sure people have probably labeled me that,” Hessman said. “I’ve had a couple brief little stints up in the major leagues, but no regular playing time. It’s a blessing just to be up here.” INSIDE PITCH R.A. Dickey will pitch Thursday afternoon against St. Louis and Mike Pelfrey on Friday night against Arizona. Jerry Manuel said this was in part because Pelfrey pitches poorly in daylight. “Maybe his clock is a little off,” Manuel said. Dickey, a knuckleballer, will be working on three days rest and coming off a leg injury.",

    "source": "Brazilian Court Council Removes a Barrier to Same-Sex Marriage <eos> RIO DE JANEIRO — The council overseeing Brazil’s judiciary ruled on Tuesday that notary publics cannot refuse to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies, a decision that opens the way for gay couples across Latin America’s largest country to marry. The move by the National Council of Justice, a 15-member panel led by Joaquim Barbosa, the chief justice of the nation’s high court, effectively legalizes gay marriage throughout Brazil, legal scholars here said. The decision follows legislation in two neighboring countries, Argentina and Uruguay, where lawmakers have managed to pass bills authorizing same-sex marriage nationwide in recent years. Still, there is some room for judicial appeals of the Brazilian decision, potentially within the high court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal, and resistance may emerge in Congress, where gay-marriage legislation has faced opposition from an influential bloc of evangelical Christian lawmakers. Even so, supporters of same-sex marriage described the council’s decision as pioneering. “This resolution will end the resistance of some courts, judges and notary publics,” said Maria Berenice Dias, the vice president of the Brazilian Institute of Family Law, a nonprofit organization that has sought for years to extend marriage benefits to gay couples. The National Council of Justice, which includes prominent judges, prosecutors and lawyers, voted 14 to 1 in favor of the measure. Under the council’s decision, notary publics will also be required to convert same-sex civil unions into marriages, if couples wish to do so. In 2011, the high court ruled by a comfortable margin that same-sex civil unions should be allowed. But while such unions provide couples in Brazil with access to benefits like health insurance and the division of assets in cases of separation, the council’s decision provides same-sex couples who marry with the same standing as heterosexuals, allowing them, for instance, to take each other’s surnames and adopt children more easily. In certain ways, the decision broadens what has already unfolded in different of parts of Brazil, where legislatures in more than 10 states have legalized same-sex marriage. But even with such laws, many notary publics — who not only certify but also carry out marriage ceremonies in Brazil — have refused to comply for gay couples, a resistance that has been backed by some of the regional judges who oversee them. “The Supreme Federal Tribunal had already shown that it was supporting minority rights by supporting gay unions,” said Thiago Bottino, a law professor at Fundação Getúlio Vargas, a top university. “The council’s decision is logical, since it would not make sense to deprive people of their rights because some notary publics and judges saw things differently.” Brazil’s courts generally hew to the decisions of the National Council of Justice, which was created in 2004 and has functioned largely as a disciplinary body for the judiciary. But Congress could be another matter, as tensions simmer between Brazil’s legislative and judicial branches over the high court’s conviction of legislators involved in a vast vote-buying scandal. Moreover, legislators who oppose same-sex marriage have recently grown more vocal in Congress. Marco Feliciano, a conservative evangelical preacher who now leads the lower house’s commission for human rights and minorities, has drawn criticism for comments that gay-rights activists call homophobic, but he has resisted pressure to step down from the post.",

    "source": "Rangers Plan to Limit Henrik Lundqvist’s Playing Time <eos> GREENBURGH, N.Y. — The Rangers may not know what to expect this season, but they do know one thing: their workhorse goalie, Henrik Lundqvist , will be playing less. Then again, they said that last year. Both Lundqvist, in an interview this week, and Coach John Tortorella, speaking on Thursday on the eve of training camp, said Lundqvist’s workload would be reduced. “What did we play him last year, 73 games?” said Tortorella, noting that no Stanley Cup-winning goalie in the last six years had played more than 62 regular-season games. “That’s ridiculous — it’s just too much.” Lundqvist said: “I think that’s the plan — it’s been the plan the last couple of years. It just didn’t turn out that way.” Last year, Tortorella said he expected Steve Valiquette, then the backup goalie, to fill in more often, but he played poorly and was demoted to Hartford. The Rangers found themselves in a season-long struggle to make the playoffs, forcing Lundqvist to play almost every game. He played superbly the whole way, including the season finale, a 46-save shootout loss to Philadelphia, 2-1, that cost the Rangers a playoff berth. “I was ready for the playoffs,” Lundqvist said. “On the other hand, that was mid-April. If your goal is to play in June, it might be better to rest a couple more games.” Over the summer, the Rangers signed Martin Biron, a reliable 33-year-old backup who has played for the Islanders, the Flyers and the Sabres. “We’re excited about Biron being here to take some of the load off Hank,” Tortorella said. Very little else about the Rangers is definite — the team’s outlook is “clouded,” as Tortorella put it. Almost every position is in flux. Right wing Marian Gaborik, whose 42 goals last season were 23 more than the next highest Ranger, remains the primary offensive threat. He will be paired on the first line with another new signing, left wing Alexander Frolov, who averaged 24 goals in seven seasons with Los Angeles. But who their center will be is unclear. The newly re-signed Marc Staal remains a top defenseman, but Tortorella said he was not sure who would be Staal’s partner. “You’ve got to give me some time till I see what this team is,” Tortorella said. “There are so many new guys in camp.” Among the new faces will be three veterans skating on a tryout basis. Wing Ruslan Fedotenko won a Stanley Cup under Tortorella with Tampa Bay in 2004. In fact, Fedotenko scored both goals in the 2-1 Game 7 victory that clinched the Cup. He won the Cup again in 2009 with Pittsburgh. Defenseman Alexei Semenov is back in camp after being offered a roster spot last season before leaving suddenly to play for Dinamo Moscow. General Manager Glen Sather told reporters Semenov left because his wife wanted to return home, but Semenov said it was because the Dinamo contract paid more. Todd White is a 35-year-old center who broke the 20-goal plateau twice with Ottawa and once with Atlanta. But he is not the No. 1 center the Rangers need. The problem for the Rangers — as it is for so many other teams — is how to fit new players under the salary cap. Staal’s new five-year contract counts as a $3.975 million cap hit, putting the Rangers $4 million over the limit. One solution could be to send the much-maligned veteran defenseman Wade Redden and his $6.5 million cap hit to Hartford. But “we’re not going to single out Wade Redden,” Tortorella said. “I’m sure it’s weighing on him a little bit,” Tortorella said. “We need to let this play out. A lot of different things can happen.” ISLANDERS STAY CLOSE The Islanders open training camp Friday in Syosset on Long Island, a long way from China, where they first planned to hold camp. Last February, the team’s owner, Charles Wang, announced an ambitious plan to stage the camp and exhibition games in Beijing, Harbin and Qiqihar. But in May, Wang canceled the trip. “In some ways, it’s good you don’t have to do that travel,” the young star John Tavares said this week. “But in other ways you’re kind of disappointed because it would have been special to see a whole different country, culture and lifestyle. It would have been cool to see.” DEVILS PREPARE FOR CUTS The Devils open camp in Newark, with physicals on Friday, under the new coach John MacLean. The team needs to cut players whose salaries total at least $3 million to make room under the salary cap for Ilya Kovalchuk. “We don’t exactly know who, but we have to get back under the cap,” Zach Parise said. “All we know is that we’re going to lose two pretty good, important players. It’s no secret that we have to get rid of some money.”",

    "source": "No-Contest Plea in Connecticut Killing Tied to Rebuffed Prom Invitation <eos> MILFORD, Conn. — A teenager accused of fatally stabbing a classmate at their high school for rejecting his invitation to the junior prom pleaded no contest to murder on Monday, and prosecutors said they would seek a 25-year prison sentence. The teenager, Christopher Plaskon, 18, accepted a plea bargain during a brief appearance in court here. Sentencing was set for June 6. Mr. Plaskon was charged with killing Maren Sanchez , 16, at Jonathan Law High School in Milford on April 25, 2014. His family and friends said he became upset that Ms. Sanchez had turned down his prom invitation. Mr. Plaskon was held at a psychiatric hospital after the stabbing. His lawyers said that he had shown signs of psychosis and that they were considering an insanity defense. Image Ms. Sanchez was 16. The attack happened in a first-floor hallway around 7:15 a.m. on the day of the junior prom. Students described an emotional scene where people were crying as police officers and paramedics swarmed the school. A witness tried to pull Mr. Plaskon off Ms. Sanchez during the attack, and another saw Mr. Plaskon discard a bloody knife, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. Mr. Plaskon was taken to the principal’s office in bloody clothing and told the police, “I did it; just arrest me,” according to the affidavit. Ms. Sanchez was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly afterward. The medical examiner’s office said she had been stabbed in the torso and neck. Ms. Sanchez, a member of the National Honor Society who was active in drama and other school activities, had been focused on the prom in the days before she was killed. She had posted on Facebook a photograph of herself wearing a blue prom dress and was looking forward to attending with a new boyfriend. A friend of Mr. Plaskon’s told the police that Mr. Plaskon had thought about hurting Ms. Sanchez because he wanted to be more than friends with her. According to the friend, Mr. Plaskon said he would not mind if Ms. Sanchez “was dead or hit by a bus.”",

    "source": "Makarova Races Past Halep and Into Australian Open Semifinals <eos> MELBOURNE, Australia — Ekaterina Makarova raced to a 3-0 lead in nine minutes and beat third-seeded Simona Halep, 6-4, 6-0, on Tuesday in the first women’s quarterfinal match at the Australian Open. With her victory, which took just 68 minutes under cool, sunny skies at Melbourne Park, Makarova advanced to a semifinal against her fellow Russian Maria Sharapova, who beat Eugenie Bouchard, 6-3, 6-2, in the next match at Rod Laver Arena. Makarova will be playing in her second consecutive Grand Slam semifinal. Her first was at last year’s United States Open, in which she lost to Serena Williams after beating Bouchard in the fourth round. Halep, a Romanian who was last year’s French Open runner-up, was under pressure from Makarova’s array of strong forehand shots to all areas of the court. Serving at 5-3 in the first set, Halep saved two set points, but Makarova clinched the opener on the third when Halep netted a backhand. Makarova broke Halep’s serve to open the second set, helped by a double fault. Makarova saved three break points in the next game to lead by 2-0 and then broke Halep again before shutting her out the rest of the way. Makarova, 26, has had her best Grand Slam results at Melbourne Park, advancing to the quarterfinals in two of the past four years and to the fourth round in the other two. Last year, she lost to the eventual champion Li Na in the fourth round, and both quarterfinal losses were to Sharapova. “I love this court — I’m so happy I came through,” Makarova said. “Before in the quarterfinals, was never sure about the semis, but now I’m there.” Two men’s quarterfinals were set for later Tuesday. Rafael Nadal was scheduled to take on Tomas Berdych, and Andy Murray was to play the local favorite Nick Kyrgios. Kyrgios, 19, beat then-No. 1 Nadal in the fourth round at Wimbledon last year. In the fourth round this year, Kyrgios defeated Andreas Seppi, who had knocked Roger Federer out of the tournament. Kyrgios is the first male player since Federer in 2001 to have reached two Grand Slam quarterfinals as a teenager.",

    "source": "Fresh Start as Yanks for Former Astros <eos> KISSIMMEE, Fla. — The entrance to Osceola County Stadium still proclaims the Houston Astros the 2005 National League Champions, a crown they clinched when a fly ball settled into Jason Lane’s glove in right field in St. Louis that October. Lane asked a club official to hold the ball while he celebrated, but he never got it back. The Astros said it belonged to the team, not the player. The next year, the Astros took away Lane’s playing time, and last September they dumped him altogether, shipping him to the San Diego Padres in the final week of the season. There he found a familiar face — Morgan Ensberg, his former teammate in Houston and at the University of Southern California. Now Lane and Ensberg are teammates again, as nonroster invitees to Yankees spring training. They are auditioning for what might be one open spot among position players, and it only figures. “We get on base, we drive guys in,” Ensberg said Monday, as the Yankees were finishing a 7-6 victory over Houston. “We’re very similar players.” There are differences, too. Ensberg plays third base. Lane is an outfielder, but he once moonlighted as a pitcher and earned the victory for U.S.C. in the championship game of the 1998 College World Series. They are strong defensive players who are learning first base and have similar hitting profiles. Ensberg and Lane draw walks and put up solid power numbers, but do not always hit for a high average. The Yankees may have room for only one of them. “I don’t really subscribe to the idea that there’s not enough room,” Ensberg said. “Maybe there is. I think if you play well, you’ll play. I’m sure Lane has the same idea — if we’re both playing in that lineup, I think we’re going to help the team.” Dressing at a locker just a few feet away, Lane said, “I simply came over here with the intention of, if I play well, there’s a spot for me on the team.” Lane homered on Sunday but went 0 for 4 on Monday. Ensberg had two hits, including a double, in his first game at first base. He made an error when a sharp grounder by Lance Berkman took a bad hop over his left shoulder. Ensberg, 32, has played one game at first in his seven-year career and is trying to learn how the ball spins to that side of the infield. Berkman, his former teammate, said Ensberg would adapt to the position and could thrive in a new setting. “Once an organization gets a stereotype on you, it’s tough to overcome that unless you go to another organization,” Berkman said. “Nobody has any limitations on what they expect from you, and I can imagine for him it’s a nice feeling to have a fresh start.” Ensberg placed fourth in the N.L. Most Valuable Player voting in 2005, when he hit .283 with 36 homers and 101 runs batted in for the Astros. He had 17 homers through the end of May the next season, but jammed his right shoulder diving for a bunt and struggled to play through pain. “He just never got a good streak going,” Astros Manager Cecil Cooper said. “He was constantly searching, and sometimes when you search, it’s hard to just get down to baseball and react instead of playing the mind game so much with yourself. Sometimes you get in those kinds of funks and it’s hard to get out.” Last season, Ensberg lost his job in Houston to Mike Lamb. He hit two homers in his first start for San Diego, then slumped down the stretch as Kevin Kouzmanoff surged. Ensberg said he turned down guaranteed roster spots with other teams to take a minor league deal with the Yankees. “This job had the least amount of security, but I think I do well in a fight,” Ensberg said. “I enjoy competing, because I think that’s how it should be. And maybe I didn’t do as well preparing myself in the past because there wasn’t anybody to compete with. Hopefully the fight prepares you.” Ensberg’s average the last two seasons was .233, but he hit 35 homers and drove in 97 runs in 669 at-bats. Lane fell into a platoon in those seasons, managing 23 homers and 72 R.B.I. in 459 at-bats. But he hit .192. “The batting average looks really bad, but as far as production and defense, I feel like I helped the team,” said Lane, who had 26 homers and a .267 average in 2005. “I just never could get in there consistently. When I was getting hits, they were productive hits. It was frustrating for me. They couldn’t get past the average and let me really play.” Lane is 31, and he expects to keep hitting for a long time. But the Yankees are looking for a left-handed reliever, and he guessed that he might still be able to throw 90 miles an hour. If he took the mound again, Lane would be pitching on 10 years’ rest. “You never know,” he said, smiling. “I’ve saved some bullets.”",

    "source": "Wi-Fi Is Increasingly Essential for Airline Travelers <eos> Tony Drockton, who owns a luxury handbag company in Southern California, used to take the overnight flight to New York, rather than waste business hours out of touch. But now, his flight time is his work time as airlines increasingly offer Wi-Fi connections on their planes. “I need to stay connected so people don’t realize where I am,” said Mr. Drockton, who now travels with a laptop, smartphone and over-the-ears headphones. “It allows me to fly during business hours and not miss any day.” As to those travelers who enjoyed a few hours of being out of touch with the office, those days may be ending. Before Wi-Fi, “you had an excuse not to be in touch if you didn’t want to be,” said Henry H. Harteveldt, co-founder of Atmosphere Research Group, an airline and travel industry analyst in San Francisco. “The one last bastion of being off the grid has been taken away.” And as airlines race to create connectivity on international flights through satellite Wi-Fi, the ability to stay online in the skies will only increase, experts say. “Passengers have an expectation of ubiquitous connectivity in their lives, especially younger travelers,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “Walking on the street, in coffee shops, and it frustrates them when they get on a plane and they are told they’re offline. The traveler wants to have control over when they go online.” Others echoed his analysis. “People want to be connected 24/7,” said Jonathan Kletzel, a transportation and logistics analyst at PWC. “It’s a question of whether airlines are getting ahead of the curve or not.” For now, technology use in the sky remains lower than on other modes of transportation, said Joseph P. Schwieterman, director of the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University. Even so, Wi-Fi Internet access has expanded to 153 million passengers in 2011 from 153,000 in 2009, according to Gogo Wireless, a Wi-Fi provider for airlines. According to a report this year from the Chaddick Institute , the percentage of air travelers using technology at “random selected points” on a flight was 28.4 percent in 2011, up from 23.2 percent in 2010 and 17.6 percent in 2009. The report found that more travelers were bringing their own devices, including tablets and e-readers, with them on planes. One in 12 airline passengers is now using a tablet, and that number continues to grow. Tablets account for almost 30 percent of all technology use on commercial flights, and that share is also likely to grow. The use of tablets and technology, in general, tends to be “significantly higher on business-oriented flights,” the report said. This leaves more than 70 percent of passengers who are not using a device, and may be using the airlines’ in-flight entertainment options, Dr. Schwieterman said. Wi-Fi stretches back commercially four to five years. Now, nine commercial airlines have Wi-Fi air-to-ground service on all or some of their domestic flights. The fees depend on the length of the flight, and tend to range from $1.95 to $19 or more, according to Gogo. Travelers are using the connection to do more than send e-mail. What travelers want, especially business travelers, is a myriad methods to stay productive and entertained while en route to their destination, airline experts said. They may use their own laptops or tablets as well as the in-flight entertainment system. Mr. Drockton, for example, said he used e-mail, air-to-ground videoconferencing, the airline’s instant messenger system and the entertainment system in the seat back in front of him when he was flying. He said he relied on the power outlet under his seat to keep his laptop charged. “I plug in before they even close the door,” he said. “I’m already working before they take off.” Until a few years ago, the airlines were a “technology wasteland,” Dr. Schwieterman said. Now, most major airlines, even those that were late to Wi-Fi, have committed to teaming up with one of the four major Wi-Fi providers. The airlines “want you to know that Wi-Fi is on the flight,” he said. “They know they need it for brand positioning.” Still, Internet connectivity in flight has its shortcomings, though Mr. Harteveldt and other frequent fliers said they expected it to improve in its next generation. “If the Wi-Fi system is maxed out, it slows down,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “You can log off and not be able to get back on, or be booted off the system.” Typically, the bandwidth of the Wi-Fi on a single-aisle plane like a Boeing 737 or an Airbus A320 can handle 25 users at a time. If one traveler begins to download a large file, “the system slows to a crawl,” he said. Kevin P. Nichols, 39, director of content strategy for SapientNitro, said that had been his experience. “It’s inconsistent, and you never know if it’s going to work or not,” he said. Mr. Nichols said Wi-Fi and in-flight entertainment provided by the airlines were among the factors travelers now considered. “There are a lot of drivers in selecting an airline,” he said. “It’s people having access to what they want. We continually want to be plugged in.” As for the future of in-flight technology, Mr. Harteveldt said it depended on technological developments, travelers’ preferences and airlines’ budgets. The airlines tend to update cabins every five years. Mr. Harteveldt predicted that within 10 years, flights would be a “B.Y.O. entertainment” environment — that is, bring your own. Until then, travelers who want to stay productive and entertained en route to their business meetings are dependent on Wi-Fi. Or, as Mr. Drockton put it: “It’s just about convenience and connectivity. I need it to work.”",

    "source": "In Search of the Perfect Holiday Drink <eos> Whether you’re expecting a handful of holiday drop-ins or hosting a spirited party, a well-made cocktail can set the tone. As restaurants around the county are raising their mixology standards, consider enhancing your home efforts with this advice from behind-the-bar pros. All agree that balance is the key to cocktail goodness. Alcohol, sweet and acid must work in harmony, so the unpracticed are advised to start with reliable recipes, then bump up the quality of the ingredients, starting with spirits. Clark Moore, beverage director at Harper’s in Dobbs Ferry , recommends this strategy for drop-in guests or dinner parties: “Stock fewer bottles of worthwhile spirits rather than a greater variety of cheaper stuff. For example, have one good gin, one rye or bourbon and one Cognac, and make sure they’re brands that you’d want to drink even without a mixer.” Vodka and tequila are popular choices to round out the home bar. Secondary spirits, like fruit- or herb-based liqueurs, can add the sweet element and expand the cocktail possibilities. In general, triple secs (orange-flavored liqueurs like Cointreau) are versatile, as are high-quality vermouths. Mr. Moore’s favorites are Carpano Antica Formula and Dolin Vermouth de Chambéry Rouge. “Add either of these to rye or Cognac for a delicious manhattan,” Mr. Moore said. “Stir one with gin, and you have a beautiful Martinez. Or add a few rocks and a lemon or orange twist for a lovely aperitif or digestif.” Note that vermouth is actually a fortified wine, so refrigerate after opening to ensure optimum shelf life. Image Bottles of bitters at Harper's. Clark Moore, beverage director at Harper's, recommends stocking up home bars with a few bottles of fine spirits instead of a variety of cheaper brands. Credit Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times For a conversation starter, try an indigenous spirit or two instead of one of the major brands. “There are a lot of finely crafted local options now, like Black Dirt Bourbon, which is distilled in Warwick,“ says Paul Bratone, co-owner and beverage director at Bistro Rollin in Pelham. “Use American Fruits Black Currant Cordial as you would crème de cassis. Sugar Wash Moonshine”— a neutral spirit distilled in Pine Plains from Demerara sugar — “can be used instead of cachaça in a New York State riff on the Brazilian caipirinha.” While you might spend more on your spirits, save on simple syrup when the drink requires it. “There’s a reason it’s called ‘simple’ syrup,” Mr. Moore says. “Just bring equal parts sugar and water to a boil, and let it cool. It’s actually quicker to make than it is to shop for it, and homemade is far less expensive.” For infused simple syrup, add the desired flavoring ingredients (fresh herbs, spices, ginger root, citrus peel) to the warm syrup and let it sit for a couple of hours, tasting periodically. When the flavor is to your desired strength, strain. Stored in a covered jar in the refrigerator, the syrup will keep through the holidays. Lemon or lime juice plays an acidic role in many recipes, and the pros agree that cocktails are vastly improved when you squeeze your own. (Note that these juices will turn, so they should be used or refrigerated immediately.) And don’t skip the bitters when they’re called for. These intense tinctures of herbs, spices, fruits and roots add dimension to a cocktail. The Beacon-based Drink More Good website carries a wide variety of bitters and other artisanal mixology ingredients. After you’ve upgraded your ingredients, tweak your technique and presentation. “Always use jiggers,” advises the bartending veteran Jeremy McClellan, now general manager of the Tapp in Tarrytown and the Mill in Hastings. “Imprecise measuring can ruin a great cocktail recipe.” Stir cocktails that rely solely on spirits, and use a shaker for cocktails that incorporate juices or sugars to blend the flavors and give it the proper chill. For restaurant-worthy serving appeal, get ice trays that make perfectly square cubes. Smaller cubes are good for serving tall mixed drinks; for spirits-forward or spirits-only cocktails, Moore prefers one extra-large cube, which won’t melt as fast and won’t dilute a drink as quickly. And don’t mistake the appropriate garnish (twisted citrus peel, fruit slices, olives) for just another pretty finish — it adds flavor too. For larger gatherings, skip the shaker and choose a punch, a mulled wine or a mulled cider for serving simplicity. As Mr. McClellan puts it, “Nobody wants to wait 20 minutes for their cocktail, and you don’t want to spend the entire party mixing drinks.” But he cautions against making it too sugary, a common amateur mistake. “Balance is critical to the punch bowl, too,” he said. For an easy-serving alternative, Mr. Moore suggests a drink that can be mixed at least partly ahead of time. Simple, festive sparkling cocktails, like kir royales or poinsettias, can be made assembly-line style. It’s wasteful to use expensive Champagne to mix with other ingredients, but for balance, be sure to use a dry sparkling wine. Mr. McClellan serves prosecco; Mr. Bratone favors Gruet, a sparkling wine that is made in New Mexico.",

    "source": "Economy Forces White Plains Performing Arts Center to Cancel a Show <eos> WHITE PLAINS GOING to the theater has always been one of Joe and Theresa Arlotta’s greatest pleasures. But after Mr. Arlotta had a stroke, they stopped going to Broadway shows in the city. Then they discovered the White Plains Performing Arts Center . They became subscribers two years ago when the theater began staging its own shows under a new artistic director. The theater’s proximity to New York City has made it easy to attract Broadway actors who can work in White Plains and live at home. “I miss Manhattan, but this is really as close as you can get for the value and the quality,” said Ms. Arlotta, 70, a legal secretary here. Her favorite show this season was “Camelot” in September; last season it was “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.” The Arlottas are looking forward to the final show of this season — “Hello, Dolly!” — which was scheduled to open on April 30 — but they are likely to be disappointed. The theater’s management has not made an official announcement yet, but because of uncertainty about finances, it is delaying “Hello Dolly” indefinitely and recently laid off a company manager, said Jack W. Batman, the center’s executive producer. It is a bitter turn of events. Staging well-known musicals, starring Tony-winning actors, the White Plains Performing Arts Center had an audience of 35,000 this season — 1,200 of whom became subscribers during the past two years. Now, with municipal and corporate money disappearing, the theater is deciding where to cut back. “So far we have had no commitments for sponsorships or grants,” said Mr. Batman, a 40-year veteran of professional theater management who normally would have budgeted in April for the 2009-10 season that begins in the fall. “It’s fair to say we are struggling.” The City of White Plains, which holds the lease on the theater’s space on the third floor of the City Center, an entertainment and retail complex downtown, announced on April 6 that it had cut all funding to the theater from its proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. The city has contributed $100,000 annually to the arts center — which has a $1.7 million budget — since its founding in 2003. “When our financial report was issued in January, we fell off a cliff,” said Mayor Joseph M. Delfino, a Republican who recently announced he will step down after overseeing a resurgence in development here during 11 years in office. A booster of the theater who never missed an opening night, Mr. Delfino said he had to fill an $11.7 million gap in next year’s $160 million city budget. To make up the shortfall, 40 city staff positions were left vacant this year and 65 part-time employees were let go. In addition to cutting money for the theater, the budget proposes eliminating backyard refuse pickup and mounted police units, as well as giving the library less support, Mr. Delfino said. Louis R. Cappelli, the developer who redrew the city’s skyline when he built the 44-story Ritz-Carlton hotel and apartment complex downtown, gave the arts center $250,000 in 2006. This year, he will give money to the theater only if the city does, said Geoff Thompson, a spokesman for Cappelli Enterprises. James F. Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, another large donor last year, said the company would reduce its contribution but had not decided how much. “The budgetary pressures we are feeling has to translate into our contributions changing,” he said. The theater’s other largest corporate donor last year, Bank of America, did not return calls seeking comment. Corporate financing plays a bigger role in the White Plains Performing Arts Center’s budget than for other regional theaters, said Will Maitland Weiss, executive director of the Arts & Business Council of New York , a nonprofit organization based in New York City that advises arts groups and corporations. “The typical regional theater would get half its income from the box office, 30 percent from individual contributions and the remaining 20 percent from foundations, government and corporations, with the corporations being the smallest part,” he said. Last year the White Plains center made half of its budget from ticket sales; 4 percent from individual donations; and 46 percent from grants from foundations, government and, mostly, corporations, according to the theater. Arts organizations that depend largely on government support are in dire straits in New York because of significant drops in tax revenue, Mr. Weiss said. “I feel there is more potential to rescue and sustain a company like the White Plains Performing Arts Center from the private sector than to go back to the public sector and try to depend on handouts,” said Mr. Weiss, who has managed nonprofit arts organizations for 25 years, including a five-year stint at an Off Broadway theater. Even though there is no show in rehearsal on the performing arts center’s stage, it is not silent. Its plush movie-theater-style seats, donated by National Amusements in Boston, are filled half the time with audiences for college and school events, corporate seminars, church concerts and programs for the White Plains Youth Bureau . Mr. Batman said he was confident that despite the center’s uncertain financial future, he would be able to put a season together for next season. “The theater will survive this,” he said. “It has survived since the time of the Greeks, it always goes on.”",

    "source": "Florida Sues BP Over Gulf Oil Spill <eos> TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — The state of Florida filed a lawsuit Saturday against the oil company BP and the cement contractor Halliburton over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, becoming the fourth state to seek damages for the 2010 disaster. The suit, among other things, faults BP for not changing the batteries on the rig’s blowout preventer. It also accuses Halliburton of installing faulty cement barriers. The complaint by the Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi, was filed in United States District Court in Panama City. The federal court has jurisdiction under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Florida is the fourth state to sue over the spill; Mississippi sued on Friday, joining Alabama and Louisiana, which are part of a federal trial in New Orleans against BP and its contractors. A BP spokesman declined to comment and press officers from Halliburton could not be reached.",

    "source": "Daily Report: A New Android for a New Tech World <eos> With little notice, Google just told us a lot about our world. On Monday, the company announced the general availability of its newest Android smartphone operating system. Looking at how it got here and what is inside the new OS reveals much about how different tech works now, when compared with just a few years ago. Google first talked about the new OS, called Nougat, last March, and gave people the opportunity to download an early version of the software. Google appears to have used that feedback heavily in the final version. Send Us Your Favorite Money Question What’s the single best question about money that anyone has ever asked you — or that you’ve asked of a spouse, family member or loved one? And what was the conversation that ensued? Not so long ago, a new computer OS was a huge deal, developed in secret and released with a marketing thunderclap. That was when personal computers were the rule, or PC-type thinking dominated phone marketing. Now speed, feedback and continuous upgrades are the rule. Nougat will appear as an update on a handful of Nexus phones over the next few weeks, and later on a new phone. It is said to have 250 new features, but is unlikely to require a lot of new learning, unlike new versions of Windows on a PC. People don’t have time for that now; if things aren’t more intuitive, they are discarded. Personalization is also a big feature of these mass-market devices, so the phone can do things like provide polyglots with search results in multiple languages, ways to reconfigure Quick Settings controls or 1,500 different emoji for nonverbal communication. Image Besides feedback and customization, speed is another design principle that has become paramount. Apps can run side by side, notifications can open apps directly and previously used apps can be easily reopened. If saving seconds sounds like a big deal, it is: Google long ago discovered that even a 200-millisecond delay can make a search seem too slow. That impatience is now a consumer norm. So much for the present state of tech design. Nougat also has a couple of indications about what’s next, in the form of augmented reality and virtual reality functions. A lot of that will be dormant for now, until new games, and hardware like headphones and game controllers, become available. It’s O.K. if you start getting impatient for that stuff. After all, by the time you read this, Nougat will have been out for an entire day or more.",

    "source": "India Opens High-Level Inquiry in Fraud Case <eos> NEW DELHI —India’s highest-level investigative agency agreed Wednesday to open an inquiry into the software outsourcing company Satyam Computer Services , a move that might complicate a quick sale of the company. The Central Bureau of Investigation, analogous to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States, will take over from the police in the state of Andhra Pradesh, where Satyam is headquartered, and a patchwork of ministries, regulators and agencies that are looking into the vast fraud at the outsourcing company. B. Ramalinga Raju, the founder of Satyam, confessed in January to padding the books and said he had fabricated holdings of some $1 billion in cash. The C.B.I., as the agency is known, “proposes to undertake an all-encompassing investigation into the scam,” it said in a statement. The bureau is establishing a “multidisciplinary investigation team” in Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh, and will be consulting daily with market regulators, the national Department of Revenue, the state government and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Meanwhile, Satyam is pulling hundreds of employees out of the United States as business slows, a company spokeswoman said Wednesday. The spokeswoman, Archana Muthappa, said several hundred employees had been moved back to India, where they continued to work for the company. She said local newspaper reports that 1,500 employees had been relocated were false, but would not specify how many employees had been moved. The employee shift comes as Satyam, under a new, government-appointed board, is cutting costs wherever possible. It has hired Goldman Sachs to help it find a buyer. The new investigation does not automatically mean that buyers will stay away, analysts said. “The important thing is whether the company was making profits or not,” said Hitesh Kuvelkar, associate director at First Global, a research firm with offices in Mumbai, London and New York. “If they have margins and turnover, there will be a taker for this company.” Investors have filed several suits against Satyam and the company’s auditor, which could also complicate a sale. Mr. Raju and his brother, B. Rama Raju, a former Satyam director, are in jail in Hyderabad. A local court on Wednesday dismissed their petitions for bail, the Press Trust of India reported. The court will allow the Securities and Exchange Board of India to question S. Gopalakrishnan and Talluri Srinivas, former partners for Price Waterhouse, Satyam’s former auditor. The firm is the Indian arm of the accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers. Satyam was the most actively traded stock on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Wednesday, where its shares fell 3.3 percent. Executives from several Indian companies, even those unrelated to the software business, have said publicly in recent days that they would be interested in buying all or part of Satyam.",

    "source": "Obama Succeeds Globally, With Little Reward <eos> WASHINGTON — The foreign policy successes of President Barack Obama — most recently, the toppling of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi — are of only marginal value to his re-election struggle. The corollary is that Republican hopes earlier this year of a one-two punch against Mr. Obama — a soft economy and softness on national security, which were determinant in unseating another Democratic incumbent in 1980 — are diminishing. This time, they can only count on a one-punch, the economy. The administration’s stepped-up drone strikes and the killing of Osama bin Laden , Anwar al-Awlaki and a host of lesser Qaeda operatives makes an “easy on terrorism” charge a tough sell. Colonel Qaddafi’s demise after a U.S.-backed air campaign ties the bow on that campaign issue. Moreover, most of the Republican presidential candidates, apart from the libertarian Ron Paul and the former Utah governor, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., are in the camp of the neoconservatives, the architects of the Iraq war. These advocates of an aggressive and expensive foreign policy are out of sync with U.S. political opinion and economic realities. The Republican foreign policy traditionalists on the model of Henry A. Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft and James A. Baker III seem absent. Witness the reaction to the president’s decision to withdraw all forces from Iraq by year’s end. Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, called it “an astonishing failure” that risked all the gains of the past decade; Governor Rick Perry of Texas accused Mr. Obama of putting political expediency ahead of sound military security and “judgment.” Herman Cain simply said it was “dumb.” They all insist on keeping a residual force. The reality is the troop withdrawal timetable was crafted by President George W. Bush three years ago. As a candidate, in 2007, then-Senator Obama vowed to carry out the plan more rapidly. Americans, by overwhelming margins, want to get out of a war that has cost more than $800 billion and 4,500 American lives, while arguably strengthening the position of Iran, now a greater threat to the United States than Iraq ever was. Further, while the administration may not have negotiated very well, the Iraqis were adamant that any small remaining U.S. force wouldn’t be immune from local laws or prosecution as are U.S. troops stationed elsewhere. Imagine the reactions of politicians who worry about any U.S. forces being under control of a U.N. command if an army private fighting 10,000 miles away were to be prosecuted by an Islamic court. The neocons argue that a presence in Iraq is essential and that modern history shows that such a commitment must be long term. Otherwise, they say, Iran threatens to dominate the region. This argument was challenged by Robert W. Merry, the editor of National Interest, a foreign policy journal. “The threat of growing Iranian dominance over Iraq is real,” Mr. Merry said in a recent article. The neocons, he said, “should have considered it before they beat the drums for an Iraq invasion that would inevitably upend the centuries-long balance of power between the Persians and the Mesopotamians.” The notion that greater Iranian influence could be checked with a residual force of 5,000 U.S. troops “borders on the ludicrous,” he says. The next drumbeat will be to oppose a significant drawdown in Afghanistan, which is clearly designated as “Obama’s war.” There is some Republican division: Mr. Paul and Mr. Huntsman have called for a speedy withdrawal, while Mr. Romney has been, at various times, both more dovish and more hawkish than Mr. Obama. Most neoconservatives envision a larger and longer-term U.S. presence. The declining public support for such an endeavor is likely to accelerate after the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, recently let slip that in any conflict with the United States, he would side with Pakistan. This wasn’t a throw-away line. It was made days after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and David Petraeus, the director of the C.I.A., on a visit to Islamabad, warned Pakistan that if it didn’t take action against terrorists, the United States would act on its own. Mr. Karzai then sought out a Pakistani television network to deliver this broadside. Similarly, the neoconservatives proudly claim that the Arab Spring resulted from Mr. Bush’s aggressive push for democracy in the Middle East; they are less than pleased, however, when that outcome produces more Islamic, anti-Israel regimes. As welcome as Colonel Qaddafi’s overthrow is to most Americans of all political persuasions, the new regime’s vow to implement Shariah, or Islamic law, is unsettling. By focusing on the need for a more aggressive foreign policy — one that won’t command popular support — Republicans may be muddying other, credible criticisms of Mr. Obama’s efforts in the international arena. It would be fair to say that the White House is usually reactive and that its foreign policy team, more than most previous administrations, considers any action first for its political and personal effect on Mr. Obama; the discussion of the merits of a policy tend to come second. Protracted decisions are depicted by the White House as a result of thoughtful deliberations. To outsiders, they seem to reflect more this political cost-benefit analysis. Afghanistan is a prime example, as captured in Bob Woodward’s best seller, “Obama’s Wars.” There are specific policies that are open to legitimate criticism; a case can be made the administration dropped the ball on the Middle East, squandering any possibilities of a breakthrough on the Israeli-Palestinian front. None of this will much matter to the electorate 53 weeks from now. As noted by Richard N. Haass, an assistant secretary of state under Colin L. Powell and now president of the Council on Foreign Relations: “It’s hard to imagine more than a handful of voters pulling the lever on the basis of foreign policy.” Yet, he adds, the lack of voter interest in foreign affairs will have important implications, because the next president will face real national security challenges. “We’re going to elect a governor in chief,” Mr. Haass says, “rather than a commander in chief.”",

    "source": "Stabbing of Israeli Woman in West Bank Suggests Shift in Violence <eos> TEKOA, West Bank — In a charity store packed with used clothing on the edge of Tekoa, a Jewish settlement in the beige hills of the southern West Bank, Michal Froman, 30 and pregnant, was shopping on Monday when a Palestinian teenager walked in. He hesitantly picked up a piece of clothing and asked the price. Ms. Froman asked if she could help him, but he suddenly pulled out a knife, stabbing and wounding her, according to a local resident who arrived seconds later. The attack took place as a funeral convoy was making its way to Jerusalem for the burial of Dafna Meir, 38, a mother of six who was fatally stabbed on Sunday at the entrance to her home in Otniel, a settlement to the south. The attacks in Tekoa and Otniel suggest a shift in the recent surge of violence, during which Palestinians have attacked Israeli soldiers, police officers and civilians, usually using knives, cars and guns as weapons. Most of the previous attacks took place on the streets of Jerusalem, in cities around Israel, or along roads and at military checkpoints in the occupied West Bank. Now, it appears that Jewish settlements in the West Bank are also targets. Since Oct. 1, Palestinian assailants have killed more than 20 Israelis, an American student and a Palestinian bystander. More than 150 Palestinians have been killed during the same period, many of them after they attacked or tried to attack Jews, and others during protests and clashes with the Israeli security forces. The assaults inside the settlements also recalled a shocking attack in 2011 when two Palestinian teenagers stabbed five members of the Fogel family to death in their beds in the northern settlement of Itamar. Most of the world considers the settlements illegal and an obstacle to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Israel says their fate should be decided in negotiations with the Palestinians, but the peace process has long been stalled. Many Palestinians have cited a July arson attack that killed a Palestinian toddler and his parents in the West Bank village of Duma as a factor contributing to the recent wave of violence. Two young Jewish extremists who were living in West Bank settlement outposts have been charged in that attack. The United States ambassador to Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, praised the progress made in the Duma case on Monday, but harshly criticized the Israel’s settlement policy and what he described as its lax enforcement policy in the West Bank, saying that “too much vigilantism” by Israelis against Palestinians in the West Bank “goes unchecked,” he said, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz . Speaking at a conference of the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, Mr. Shapiro added, “At times there seem to be two standards of adherence to the rule of law: one for Jews and another for Palestinians.” Amid the fraught tangle of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Tekoa, a mixed community of Orthodox and secular Jews perched on the edge of the Judean desert a few miles from Bethlehem, has an unusual reputation for tolerance. Following the vision of its chief rabbi, Menachem Froman , who counted Yasir Arafat as a friend and who died in 2013 , many of Tekoa’s residents say they seek to live in peaceful coexistence with their Palestinian neighbors. Ms. Froman, who was injured on Monday, is married to one of the rabbi’s sons. Image The body of an Israeli woman who was fatally stabbed a day earlier at the entrance to her West Bank home in the Jewish settlement of Otniel, during her funeral on Monday. Credit Ronen Zvulun/Reuters Eviatar Kanotopsky, 36, had just arrived at his yoga studio, opposite the secondhand clothing store in Tekoa’s small industrial zone, when he heard Ms. Froman and two other women running out, screaming. “Michal had blood on her shoulder,” he recalled a few hours later, sitting in his studio in a sheepskin coat, his head wrapped in a turban. He described Tekoa as “a spiritual place.” “I am not afraid. It’s a matter of personality. My wife is afraid,” Mr. Kanotopsky said. “On the other hand, I say to myself, the stabber was a young kid. It’s not that all the villages around here attacked us. But fear has an effect, like in the rest of the country.” Amichai Solomon, 40, a preschool teacher here, said: “Personally I find it quite ironic that Rabbi Menachem Froman’s family has to endure this sort of random act of violence against innocents. It is a family that is all about peace and dialogue and living together.” Ms. Froman’s husband, Shivi Froman, told the Israeli news site Ynet what his wife had told him about the boy who stabbed her. “She felt that more than he wanted to kill her, he wanted to die,” he said. “They must be taught life, and we must fight without confusion against the envoys of death and the culture of death.” In another case that shocked Israelis, two schoolboys from Tekoa, Koby Mandell, a son of immigrants from the United States, and his friend Yosef Ishran were bludgeoned to death with stones in a cave near the settlement in 2001, during the second Palestinian intifada. John Kirby, a State Department spokesman, condemned “in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attacks over the past two days against Israeli civilians.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel rejected Mr. Shapiro’s remarks, calling them “unacceptable and incorrect,” and accused the Palestinian Authority of inciting violence in the West Bank. Avigdor Lieberman, the leader of the ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu Party, which sits in opposition in the Israeli Parliament, excoriated Mr. Netanyahu for the deterioration in security for Israelis, saying: “In Israel there is no functioning prime minister. There is a prime minister only interested in surviving.” Mr. Lieberman, who lives in the neighboring settlement of Nokdim, was speaking in front of the shop where the attack took place on Monday, and said he had come as a concerned resident of the area. The assailant in the Tekoa attack on Monday was about 15, according to Israeli news reports, and had entered the settlement through a hole in its perimeter fence. He was shot and wounded by security personnel, the military said, and taken to an Israeli hospital in Jerusalem, where he is under arrest. Ms. Meir, who was buried in Jerusalem, was a hospital nurse and a mother of six, including two foster children. At least three of her children were in the house at the time of the attack, but they were unharmed. The search for her killer continues. Ms. Meir’s oldest daughter, Renana, 17, who witnessed the fatal stabbing, eulogized her mother. “It’s hard to believe we will not laugh anymore,” she said. “We won’t argue anymore. We won’t sit and have tea together at midnight. It’s hard to believe you won’t escort me to the wedding canopy, or to the army induction center, or to the maternity ward.”",

    "source": "Lawyer for Officer Moreno Makes Closing Arguments in Rape Case <eos> Consciousness. A foggy memory. The lack of physical evidence. Those were the three main points reiterated on Friday by the lawyer for a police officer accused of raping a drunken woman he had been called to help. In nearly four hours of closing arguments in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, urged jurors to acquit his client, Police Officer Kenneth Moreno , because the case was littered with doubt. He emphasized that the woman was conscious, walking on her own and talking, as seen on surveillance footage showing Officer Moreno and his partner, Franklin Mata , escorting her into her East Village apartment building. The prosecution’s theory of rape is that the woman was physically unable to consent because she was too drunk. “If she’s not unconscious, not physically unable to communicate, you can stop,” Mr. Tacopina told the jurors, referring to his belief that there was no need to deliberate beyond that point and reach Officer Moreno’s testimony that there was no sex between the two. “The fact of the matter is she wasn’t physically helpless at all.” Prosecutors accused Officer Moreno of raping the woman while she lay face-down and dazed on her bed, while Officer Mata, also charged with rape, stood guard. But then Mr. Tacopina turned to the no-sex argument. The prosecution failed to present physical evidence, offering not so much as a hair of Officer Moreno’s, left behind in the woman’s bed, he said. That “they don’t find one hair is impossible” if the woman’s story were true, he said. “It’s impossible.” Semen or lubricant also were not found in the woman or on her bed, Mr. Tacopina said. “The lack of DNA in this case is death,” he said. “No semen and no lubricant and no injuries means no sex.” Mr. Tacopina also tried to show jurors that the certainty the woman portrayed on the witness stand belied the uncertainty of statements she made in the days after she said the attack occurred in December 2008. A few days after she said she was attacked, he said, the woman told an investigator that on the night in question, a taxi driver assisted her out of his car. That turned out to be untrue, Mr. Tacopina said. “She’s actually creating things in her mind that weren’t accurate, that are not true,” he said. Mr. Tacopina also emphasized investigators’ notes in which the woman’s friends said she told them she “believed” or “thinks” she was raped. “Her memories from that morning were vague and piecemeal,” Mr. Tacopina said. “Whatever limited, skewed memories she had, she tries to connect the dots.” That led her to solidify in her mind an inaccurate narrative, he said. Mr. Tacopina did not address Officer Moreno’s account on the witness stand that the woman came on to him and that he resisted her advances. “To me, it was something that speaks for itself,” he said outside the courthouse. He did, however, tell the jury that his client was sincere despite aggressive cross-examination from a prosecutor. He said that Officer Moreno’s comment on cross-examination that he does not “kiss and tell” was a sign that he was an ordinary person. “He’s not a very sophisticated guy,” Mr. Tacopina said, adding that his client was “maybe a bit of a simpleton.” Closing arguments are scheduled to continue on Monday with Officer Mata’s lawyer and then the prosecution.",

    "source": "Andy Pettitte Rejects Yankees’ Offer, Making Return Uncertain <eos> In some ways, Andy Pettitte is no different from the dozens of other free agents to start the new year without a team. Players all over baseball are waiting for better offers, and teams are searching for bargains. But Pettitte is not like other players, and the Yankees are not like other teams. Pettitte has pledged his loyalty to the Yankees, and the Yankees have spent lavishly this winter at a time when many clubs are scaling back. A reunion seemed inevitable at the start of the off-season, but now it is uncertain. Pettitte has rejected the Yankees’ one-year, $10 million offer, according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations, and there is no standing offer for now. Pettitte could return because some in the Yankees’ hierarchy want him back. But in a winter of aggressive activity, the Yankees have been unwilling to bend for Pettitte. As an eight-year, $180 million deal for first baseman Mark Teixeira becomes official with a news conference Tuesday, the awkward Pettitte drama plays out in the background. The offer to Pettitte represented a 37.5 percent decrease from his $16 million salary last season. Pettitte considered the offer for weeks, then met with General Manager Brian Cashman in Texas after the winter meetings last month. Pettitte might wonder why the Yankees offered a pay cut at a time when they spent a combined $243.5 million on C. C. Sabathia and A. J. Burnett. If he is, though, Pettitte has not said so. Reached by The New York Times on Dec. 3, he said he wanted to return but was leaving the matter to his agent, Randy Hendricks, who did not respond to e-mail messages Monday. Derek Lowe is still available in free agency, and after the Yankees’ stealth pursuit of Teixeira, anything seems possible. The fifth spot in the rotation probably belongs to Phil Hughes for now, but the easiest answer is to retain Pettitte. He led the team in innings despite pitching with shoulder pain, going 14-14 with a 4.54 earned run average. At 36 and a father of four, Pettitte has taken a year-to-year approach to his career. The Yankees let him take his time in deciding whether to exercise a one-year option after the 2007 season, and he waited until early December, just before the release of the Mitchell report . Pettitte did not tell the Yankees that he might be included in the report, which said he had used human growth hormone. Pettitte admitted his use and the Yankees supported him publicly. But his performance suffered in the second half of the season, when he usually gets stronger, and he admitted his distracting off-season might have been a factor. In a way, though, such honesty has always been part of Pettitte’s appeal; his sincerity and earnestness have made him a fan favorite. In an interview in September, Pettitte forecast a quick negotiation, even though he knew it might not be wise to do so. “Obviously anyone else would say, ‘I’ll go wherever I want to,’ because people want to try to get the most money,” Pettitte said before a Yankees-Angels game in Anaheim, Calif. “But, I mean, I’m not going anywhere, you know what I’m saying? The Yankees know me enough, it’s not like I’m going to hold out. I guess if I had spent all my money or whatever, it might be different. But it’s not about that, really, anymore.” Pettitte also said he would discuss his future with his family, so the possibility exists that he will simply retire. Yet those who have talked to Pettitte, including Manager Joe Girardi, have been under the impression that he wants to play for the Yankees. “He’s still excited about coming back,” Girardi said on Dec. 18, adding that Pettitte was enthusiastic about the Yankees’ roster moves. For Pettitte to be part of the team again, though, one stubborn party must back down.",

    "source": "Behind the Scenes at ‘Pterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs’ <eos> In a brightly lit production studio at the American Museum of Natural History in February, 12 artists were hard at work, heads down, eyes focused. In one corner, a sculptor was shaping clay to create a cat-size flying reptile, a rhamphorhynchus , using a tracing of the animal’s footprints that had been captured in a stone trackway excavated in Utah. In a back room, in hazmat suits and respirators, a team of three was building another kind of a pterosaur, as the flying reptiles are known: a nine-foot-long tropeognathus from foam, fiberglass and epoxy around an aluminum frame. But in the center of it all was the big daddy — the 28-foot-long quetzalcoatlus , with a wingspan as wide as a fighter jet and a crested head the size of a canoe. As the star of the museum’s latest show, “Pterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs” opening on April 5, he has had four artists assigned to him full time since December. Hannah Rawe , a sculptor, was seated next to the foam-filled animal, scratching what were supposed to be tiny hairs into its huge shoulder. At one point, she stopped to ask her boss where the hairs should end and smooth skin should begin. They emailed Alexander Kellner , one of the two curators of the show, a paleontologist at the Museu Nacional in Brazil. Stop at the wrist, he instructed them. And so Ms. Rawe did. Since the fall, Ms. Rawe and all 55 members of the museum’s exhibitions team have been working closely with curators, paleontologists and scientific consultants to get their creations — down to a hair — as close to reality as possible. In addition to painters and sculptors, there are computer animators, graphic designers and filmmakers. These three floors in this part of the museum complex — the Power House, where the coal fires were once stoked to heat the entire museum — are where art meets science. Where theory becomes reality. Image Building Pterosaurs Down to Their Hairs, William Henry Harrison’s Killer, Medical Device Loopholes A new exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History will feature great reptiles that soared over 60 million years ago; historians may be dead wrong about what killed the shortest-tenured American president; how safe are the medical devices in use in hospitals and doctors’ offices? <br><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/science-times/id120316173?mt=2\">Subscribe to the Podcast »</a> With each changing exhibition, including “Darwin,” “Whales: Giants of the Deep” and “The Power of Poison” and now this pterosaurs show, scientists translate their concepts for the visual realm. And artists patiently tease out the minutiae of science from experts in the field. “It’s kind of like the Santa’s workshop of the museum,” said the museum’s spokesman, Roberto Lebron, about the fifth-floor exhibitions studio. “These are the people who put it all together.” For the past 90 years, artists and sculptors — known as museum preparators — have labored in this room. The taxidermy for the museum’s famous displays and dioramas were done here in the 1930s. Hanging high on the studio walls are antlers, fish and casts of animal faces from old specimens, as well as one black-and-white photo of workers scraping an elephant hide for the Akeley Hall of African Mammals . From Idea to Exhibit Those animals still fill the museum’s halls, frozen in time. But these days, the beehive of activity inside the studio never seems to end. There are usually two special exhibitions each year, with work on one starting just as work on another is ending. The creation of each show begins in much the same way, with executive-level museum administrators learning from, and hashing out ideas with, the curators of each exhibition — this time, Dr. Kellner and Mark A. Norell , head of paleontology for the museum, who has curated more shows than anyone else on staff. Dr. Norell, one of the stars of the paleontology world, spends half his time traveling the globe, acquiring fossils in places like China and Romania, and the other half explaining to the staff what to do with them. Early on, the curators decide which animals they want to include. An architectural model is made of the show to figure out what will go where. “The process is kind of like making a film,” said Dr. Norell, seated in his rounded office in one of the museum’s brownstone turrets overlooking Central Park West near West 77th Street. “You have an idea, then the smaller pitch, then the shooting script, deciding how everything’s laid out, what objects and artifacts to use, what the look and feel of the show is going to be; then you start building your models.” Dr. Norell and his fellow scientists work closely with the artists to come up with drawings for each specimen. Together they decide what the creature will look like, based on fossils and research materials, then what position it will be in: soaring, flapping, mouth open, mouth closed. The color of a long-extinct animal can sometimes be determined by melanosomes — intercellular bodies that might be preserved in the fossils. Minute amounts of chemical residue that hint at color are also sometimes present. Based on discussions and research, the artists make their sketches, which Dr. Norell must approve, usually with some back and forth. Then the team starts building. Image From left, Hannah Rawe, Jack Cesareo and Tom Doncourt prepared a model for the exhibit. Credit Roderick Mickens/AMNH A few exhibitions staff members have biology backgrounds and do much of their own research. Jason Brougham , who is working on a diorama for the coming show, researched the pterosaurs and fish that would be included, as well as the plant life from the early Cretaceous period . He helped advise many of the other artists on anatomy. While most of the staff was still working on the “Power of Poison” exhibition this summer, Mr. Brougham was already immersed in prehistoric flying reptiles and their environment. He worked closely with John Maisey , a paleontologist on staff, who has dug in Brazil’s fossil-rich Romualdo Formation. Mr. Brougham studied biology as an undergraduate, switched to scientific illustration, then got his master’s in fine art, studying painting. At the museum his past creations include replicas of the human brain and twisting brass models of genome protein folds. “I came to New York to be a big-shot painter,” Mr. Brougham said. “But I took a day job here and totally fell in love with scientific art, reconstructing extinct animals. I really found my calling. It’s great at cocktail parties: a billionaire hedge-fund manager and a 5-year-old both want to talk to you with equal interest.” For the diorama, Mr. Brougham also worked closely with Dr. Kellner, using a thalassodromeus skull fossil from which they extrapolated what the rest of the animal might have looked like. They examined a similar pterosaur specimen, tupuxuara, to piece together the body. “Most of the questions that we actually get from artists, the answer is, ‘I don’t know,’ ” Dr. Kellner said. But the more research that’s done, the closer their guess can be on an animal that’s been extinct for 66 million years. “In art you can do whatever you want,” Dr. Kellner said. “You have an expression of how you feel about a certain subject. But in paleo art, you don’t have that liberty. You must try to present the reconstruction of those animals the best way that you can based on true scientific evidence.” Image Rebecca Meah, principal preparator, added finishing touches to a tropeognathus model. Credit Piotr Redlinski for The New York Times Together, he and Mr. Brougham reconstructed the muscle groups, then placed the eye and soft tissue, including a crest and big gullet, where they should be. The artists at the museum use not only fossils to determine what the animal might have looked like, but also anything and everything else that might help. In the quetzalcoatlus work space, there were photographs of modern birds — a Marabou stork and a crane — and even a photo of a raw chicken cut and splayed open to help envision the musculature. The curators watch the process closely, touring the work space every few days or, if they’re away, receiving photos of the progress and offering tweaks and suggestions. There is a weekly meeting to discuss the show’s progress. A Moving Target Sometimes, changes in science happen so quickly that an artist’s creation must be considerably altered. For instance, Michael Habib , a consulting scientist who specializes in the aeronautics of pterosaurs, was about to publish a new paper, and he suggested all the bodies of the models be slimmed down. The feet of Quetzalcoatlus underwent major changes as well: Five toes per foot were edited down to four; they were shortened and the toenails removed. Changes on the fifth floor were then communicated to the multimedia artists two floors down so that their work — which included an interactive digital flying pterosaur — would match. Rather than being frustrated by the constant changes to their creations, most of the artists seem proud to be working to get things exactly right. Tom Doncourt, an artist and a former cabinetmaker who made the original sketch of the quetzalcoatlus for the show based on a skeleton already in the museum, said that the challenge of fast-changing information was not unique to prehistoric reptile science. The Hall of Human Origins, built in the 1990s, was quickly made out of date by anthropological discoveries, he said. “Sometimes it’s obsolete the minute we finish it,” said Mr. Doncourt, now a senior principal preparator at the museum. The “ Dark Universe ” show in the planetarium had to be adjusted as well. Midway through production last year, a higher-resolution map of the cosmic microwave background was released. The new data was integrated into the show. Image Claws for a model. The exhibitions team has worked with paleontologists on details for months. Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times “Occasionally,” said Dr. Kellner, “once you have it done, everything is fine, everyone is happy. But then a year later someone makes a new discovery. This is why we paleontologists are never going to be out of a job.” Mick Ellison , who has worked with Dr. Norell for 24 years, photographing fossils and reconstructing animals from them, said he did not like relying on previous drawings because there was no telling how accurate they are. Mistakes, he said, can be passed down from artist to artist, year after year. For the “Whales” exhibition last year, Mr. Ellison, a senior principal artist, used a jawbone to recreate an entire Andrewsarchus , a long-extinct land-dwelling relative of the whale. “It was this big hairy beast that had always looked this certain way that was completely inaccurate if you looked at the fossil,” Mr. Ellison said. “It didn’t look anything like this image. But everybody copied this image. Discovery Channel, all these dinosaur movies.” So Mr. Ellison tries not to take anything for granted. “It’s pretty satisfying if you can get close to something that’s true,” he said. Mr. Ellison, who studied at the Maryland Institute College of Art and worked as a medical illustrator, has taken anatomy classes to help him recreate creatures great and small. For the quetzalcoatlus wing he created for the show, Mr. Ellison used an old-school trick to get it just right: the grid method, which dates back to the Renaissance. He placed the huge wing bone model on a giant piece of graph paper and numbered each square so that the finished product — the filled-in wing — would fit the bone exactly. He then went new-school and composed the drawing on the computer. But the wing and the matching computer file were so large that the computer kept freezing. So he broke the file in two. Most people, he said, think art and science are two different worlds. “I used to think they were very separate, but they’re actually very similar. You have to be creative and you have to be observant.”",

    "source": "Iran Fighting Proxy War in Iraq, U.S. Envoy Says <eos> WASHINGTON — Iran is engaging in a proxy war with the United States in Iraq , adopting tactics similar to those it has used to back fighters in Lebanon, the United States ambassador to Iraq said Friday. The remarks by the ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker , reflected the sharper criticism of Iran by President Bush and his top deputies over the past week, as administration officials have sought to trace many of their troubles in Iraq to Iran. Mr. Crocker said in an interview that there had been no substantive change in Iranian behavior in Iraq, despite more than a year of talks between the Bush administration and Iran over how to calm Shiite-Sunni tensions in Iraq. He said that the paramilitary branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps was continuing to direct attacks by Shiite militias against American and Iraqi targets, although he offered no direct evidence. Asked if the United States and Iran were engaged in a proxy war in Iraq, Mr. Crocker said, “I don’t think a proxy war is being waged from an American point of view.” But, he added, “When you look at what the Iranians are doing and how they’re doing it, it could well be that.” While Bush administration officials have long denounced what they have described as Iran’s meddling in Iraq, Mr. Crocker’s language was unusually strong, reflecting fresh concern about what he described in Congressional testimony this week as Iran’s role in supplying militias with training and weapons, including rockets used in recent attacks on the Green Zone, in Baghdad. The Bush administration is trying to exploit any crack it can find between the largely Shiite, pro-Iranian government of the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, and Iran’s Shiite government. On Friday, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said that Iran’s role in supporting radical Shiite militias in recent clashes with Iraqi security forces had been an “eye-opener” for the central government in Baghdad. “I think that there is some sense of an increased level of supply of weapons and support to these groups,” Mr. Gates said. “I would say one of the salutary effects of what Prime Minister Maliki did in Basra is that I think the Iraqi government now has a clearer view of the malign impact of Iran’s activities inside Iraq.” From Mr. Bush down, administration officials this week have been turning up the volume on Iran. Administration officials said that Iranian support for Shiite militias became increasingly evident late last month during the indecisive Iraqi operation to wrest control of Basra from Shiite militias, in addition to the rocket attacks on the Green Zone. Administration officials have long accused Iran of supporting Shiite militias in attacks on American forces in Iraq. The difference now is that administration officials are trying to convince the Iraqi government that Iran may not be the ally it thought, and is behind attacks against Iraqi government forces. That is a harder sell, given that Iran has supported Iraq’s government. Mr. Bush this week accused Iran of arming, financing and training what he called “illegal militant groups.” He said that Iran had a choice, and hinted that the United States would try to sow distrust between the governments of Iran and Iraq, if Iran did not stop backing the attacks. “If Iran makes the right choice, America will encourage a peaceful relationship between Iran and Iraq,” he said Thursday. “If Iran makes the wrong choice, America will act to protect our interests and our troops and our Iraqi partners.” Mr. Gates, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, said that Iraqi officials were starting to pay heed. “They have had what I would call a growing understanding of that negative Iranian role, but I think what they encountered in Basra was a real eye-opener for them.” Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, echoed the assessment that Basra offered evidence to counter statements that Iran was decreasing its efforts in Iraq. “As far as I’m concerned, this action in Basra was very convincing that indeed they haven’t,” the admiral said. In addition, Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top commander in Iraq, told reporters on Friday that while the Iraqi police and army troops had established security through most of Basra, “several significant neighborhoods are not under control of the Iraqi security forces.” Combating the Shiite militias in those enclaves of Basra, Iraq’s second-largest city, will be “a months-long operation,” he said. Iran remains one of the Bush administration’s stickiest foreign policy issues, and Washington is battling Iran on multiple fronts, as administration officials struggle to find a carrot-and-stick approach for influencing Iranian behavior. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday that the United States would consider new incentives or sanctions as part of its battle to get Iran to rein in its nuclear ambitions. She said she did not anticipate a new push just yet, but said that “we will always continue to consider refreshing both tracks,” referring to the administration’s two-track approach of sanctions if Iran continues to enrich uranium and incentives if it stops. Russia and China have been urging major powers to sweeten the incentives package, but thus far the United States has balked. During the interview, Mr. Crocker accused Iran of meddling in Afghanistan, Lebanon and Gaza, in addition to Iraq. He also faulted Iraq’s Arab neighbors for refusing to help, noting that a promised Saudi Arabian Embassy had yet to materialize. “The Arabs are basically missing in action,” Mr. Crocker said. He said that while Saudi Arabia had helped in American attempts to rein in the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq, Sunni governments in the Middle East needed to establish more of a diplomatic presence in Iraq, which Bush officials believe would further legitimize the American-backed Iraqi government. “It’s one of those things that have been in process for a long time,” Mr. Crocker said of the promised Saudi Embassy. “They’ve sent a delegation to scout out property. But somehow it never quite gets done.”",

    "source": "2010 Long Island Weather Set Stage for Fine 2011 White Wines <eos> Mother Nature made it nearly impossible to produce disappointing Long Island wines last year. The outstanding vintage set the stage for especially rewarding white-wine drinking this year, when the 2010s will be released. Reds will mature in oak barrels for two or more years. The rising quality of dry and off-dry whites (as well as cabernet franc, a red) has challenged the hoary notion that the East End is chiefly merlot country. Ambitious sparkling wines are also catching on, and alluring French-style rosés, which flatter maritime cuisine, are proliferating. Local vintners are striving to create signature wines by defining and transmitting their terroirs: the mix of soils, topography and climate that gives wines particular characters. Chardonnays, sauvignon blancs and rieslings that experience minimal intervention in winemaking and are reared in steel tanks and neutral barrels can express terroir nicely. New oak can mask it. Top-notch wineries like Bedell Cellars , Channing Daughters , Macari Vineyards , Shinn Estate Vineyards and Wölffer Estate Vineyard seem particularly attuned to the specifics of terroir. Their cellar methods seem to be adjusting to those specifics. There is a tier of less prominent producers whose 2010 wines are also likely to be inviting. It includes Anthony Nappa Wines , Bouké Wines , Clovis Point Wines , Comtesse Thérèse , Diliberto Winery , Jason’s Vineyard , Mattebella Vineyards , McCall Wines , Onabay Vineyards , Roanoke Vineyards , Suhru Wines and Waters Crest Winery. The new year brings the industry a potential downside. State budget constraints may prevent the New York Wine and Grape Foundation , a trade association, from subsidizing the Long Island Wine Council , a trade group, at the current level of almost $24,000. That kind of cutback would force vintners to spend more of their own money on marketing, raising the prospect of higher prices.",

    "source": "Once Again, .500 Slips From Mets’ Grasp <eos> PITTSBURGH — The final step to reaching the podium of mediocrity has been fleeting for the Mets . For the third time in less than a week, the Mets sought to reach the elusive .500 mark, only to be thrust backward. A pair of base-running mistakes led to the Mets’ demise this time, enabling the Pittsburgh Pirates to beat the Mets on Monday night, 3-1 , as the teams split a four-game series at PNC Park. But while they played even during this series, the Mets have found it more challenging to level their overall record. Since April 9, the Mets (32-34) have spent all of 24 hours at .500. They have not been at .500 since May 20, when they were 22-22 , and five times this year, they have attempted to reach that mark from a game behind, only to go 1-4. “It’s important,” Jose Reyes said. “We want to play .500 or better. When you play below .500, it means you don’t play too good. So we want to get to the .500 mark, and even better. We’ve had a couple opportunities to get there and let it get away.” Manager Terry Collins said he was not concerned about the team creating a self-imposed mental hurdle about the .500 mark. He explained that if his players had simply executed better, especially on the basepaths, they might have had a different result. “We had two base-running mistakes, and it ended up costing us perhaps the ballgame,” Collins said. “We didn’t execute, and that’s ultimately what it will take.” In fact, much of the outcome of this game was determined by plays in the dirt. In the first inning, Jose Tabata, the Pirates ’ left fielder, was allowed to stay on third base after he was tagged out because the second-base umpire Jerry Layne ruled that Reyes had interfered with him after he rounded second base. Mike Pelfrey, who was backing up third at the time, said he thought it was the right call, but Collins argued it. Nevertheless, Tabata stayed put, briefly, then scored on a single by Neil Walker. With the Mets trailing in the fifth, 1-0, Daniel Murphy was picked off second base when Pelfrey failed to make contact on a bunt attempt. Murphy broke for third too early and could not scramble back. It was the second time on the trip a pitcher failed to get down a bunt attempt and a base runner was caught. In the first game of this series, Josh Thole was caught in a rundown after Dillon Gee failed to get down the bunt. Then, in the bottom of the fifth, Brandon Wood hit a home run off Pelfrey (3-5), who allowed two runs and four hits in seven strong innings. Pelfrey, however, was outpitched by Paul Maholm, who allowed three hits and two walks in seven shutout innings. The score remained 2-0 as the game moved to the eighth, when the Mets ran themselves into more trouble. This time, it was the rookie Lucas Duda who made the mistake. After Ruben Tejada led off with a walk and Duda singled to right, the Mets had runners at first and third and nobody out. Reyes hit a sinking line drive to left field that Tabata appeared to trap off the turf. Duda had broken all the way to second, and when Tabata came up with the ball and it was ruled a catch, Duda did not have time to get back to first and was doubled up. Duda’s base-running mistake was not mimicked by Tejada, who tagged up and scored easily. Trailing by 2-1 in the bottom of the eighth, the Mets allowed an insurance run. Manny Acosta loaded the bases by allowing three singles, and Tim Byrdak walked Walker to make it a two-run game. INSIDE PITCH The Mets announced that Johan Santana, who is recovering from shoulder surgery, felt soreness in his left shoulder June 3 and has not thrown off the mound since then. General Manager Sandy Alderson said Santana was still not at the place where a pitcher would be at the beginning of a spring training, so his return would not come until at least August. Santana is expected to get back on the mound at the end of this week, and if he can throw two or three times without feeling pain, he would begin a process that should mirror a typical six-week spring training. But Alderson and Terry Collins both said that Santana would dictate his own pace, and that there is no guarantee he would come back at all this season. “Ultimately, when he feels right, he’ll pitch,” Collins said. “We can only hope that it comes in July maybe, or August or September. But we hope he comes back. And if not, if he’s ready next spring, we’re going into spring training with a pretty good pitcher on our team.”",

    "source": "Player Sees Tour Finale as Golden Opportunity <eos> ORLANDO, Fla. — Not long ago, the last official money event on the PGA Tour was known as the Fear and Loathing Open by touring pros trying to secure playing status for the next year by finishing in the top 125 in earnings. The nickname now seems quaint and a bit overwrought. In an era when a tour player who finishes inside 150 on the list will probably earn $500,000 and get in 15 Tour events and however many Nationwide Tour events he can play in the next year, the fear factor is not what it used to be. And while this year’s season finale includes the usual battle for players on the bubble, it also has a subplot of genuine hope real enough to move all but the most hardened cynic. Playing here in the Children’s Miracle Network Classic at Disney World is Erik Compton, the 28-year-old pro who five months ago received his second heart transplant and whose recent play has been almost, well, fictional. “Obviously, it’s a very fitting event, the Children’s Miracle Network,” Compton said of the sponsor organization that funds a network of 170 children’s hospitals in North America with private donations from individuals and corporations. “Considering everything that I’ve been through, I kind of know what the kids are going through because I’ve been there.” Two weeks ago Compton squeaked through the first stage of the tour’s qualifying school by shooting a final-round 68 to make up seven strokes and advance with the rest of the top 23 from Crandon Park Golf Course near Miami to next week’s second of three stages. Then, in a tune-up for this event, he shot a course-record 65 at Old Palm Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., a regular haunt of prominent tour regulars. Those efforts attracted the attention of PGA Tour tournament directors like Kevin Weickel of the Children’s Miracle Network, who offered Compton an exemption this week, and network news reporters like ABC’s Jeffrey Kofman, who interviewed Compton last week. His competitors and friends on the tour also took note. One of his pals, Brad Adamonis, is 120th on the money list and battling to maintain the tour playing privileges he earned for the first time this year. “It’s unbelievable,” Adamonis said, smiling and shaking his head. “Third heart. It’s amazing. I think being able to use a golf cart certainly helps him out. He probably wouldn’t be able to play if he didn’t have a golf cart, and, you know, I don’t know if he feels 100 percent yet. But here he is. It’s pretty unbelievable.” It seems unbelievable to everyone except Compton. He was granted an exemption by the PGA Tour to use a golf cart until March, “which hopefully will change in the next few months as I get stronger,” he said. He said he already felt strong enough to talk some trash on the practice range with his fellow University of Georgia graduate Bubba Watson, the tour’s longest hitter, about who can hit the ball farther. After getting a new driver from a manufacturer’s representative on Monday, Compton was going back and forth with Adamonis about how he was now hitting the ball 20 yards farther than his friend. Smiling slyly, Compton said, “You know, because I’ve got some weight back on and don’t really look like I’ve had any kind of problem, I find myself having to apologize to guys, you know, like, ‘Dude, I’m sorry I’m hitting it past you, but I really did have a heart transplant five months ago.’ ” Not that he is trying to incite anyone. It is just that Compton has never lacked confidence. As he begins to feel better each day, he is buoyed by the exhilaration of simply being alive. And he wants to make the most of every minute. “I mean, I’m just dumb enough to think that I could win the tournament,” he said, laughing again. “I thought going into Q school, I should win that tournament. I feel like I have a really good golf swing. I feel like I can putt the ball just as good as anybody. If my stamina is good and I can control my emotions, I just don’t see why not.” Adamonis said he does not doubt it. He was playing with Compton in a Nationwide Tour event last year in Boise, Idaho, when Compton inexplicably made a quintuple-bogey 9 on a hole to miss the cut by a stroke. At the time, Adamonis said he thought, “What an idiot.” Compton went home and had a heart attack two days later. Had the attack occurred while he was playing in Idaho, he might not have made it to the hospital as quickly as he did in Miami. On Tuesday, six months after the transplant, Compton allowed himself a flight of fancy. “I mean, if I won this week, what would the headline be?” he said. It may have the word miracle in it somewhere.",

    "source": "Cuban Slugger Brings Promise and Risk to the Plate <eos> During this year’s World Baseball Classic, Cuba’s Jose Dariel Abreu hit a grand slam against China that was positively jaw-dropping. Abreu, a powerfully built right-handed hitter, loaded up on his back leg, waited on a curveball and hit a towering drive halfway up the outfield stands. Thirty major league front offices were surely paying attention. Last month, Abreu defected from Cuba, the latest player to leave the nation to pursue a major league career. Yasiel Puig’s electric summer in Los Angeles for the Dodgers and Yoenis Cespedes’s success with the Oakland Athletics the past two seasons have helped to fuel the hype surrounding Abreu’s imminent arrival in the majors. It is possible that when Abreu does sign, his deal will be the richest of any Cuban defector, topping Puig’s $42 million. “There is more and more interest in the Cuban players all the time,” said the agent Jaime Torres, who represents Puig. “Look how well they are doing.” Still, Abreu is a player who has spent his career hidden from most major league scouts and has essentially been competing against hard-to-evaluate opponents. He could be the next great Cuban star, or merely the beneficiary of a bull market for Cuban players. There is little certainty either way. Abreu, 26, stands 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 250 pounds. He is a first baseman with ample power, but also a sharp batting eye and the ability to hit for a high average. The numbers he put up in Cuba’s Serie Nacional are staggering. Image Abreu is expected to sign a lucrative contract though it is unclear if he can successfully adapt to the majors like the Athletics’ Yoenis Cespedes. Credit Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images In the 2009-10 season, Abreu rose to stardom when he hit .399 with 30 home runs, 76 runs batted in and a .555 on-base percentage. The next year he had one of the best seasons in the history of the Cuban league, batting .453 with 33 home runs and 93 R.B.I. in only 66 games (he missed 23 with bursitis in his shoulder). His past two seasons have been similarly prodigious. At the World Baseball Classic this year, he was 9 for 25 with 3 home runs in 6 games. Abreu is often called a four-tool player, missing only the speed of his countrymen Puig and Cespedes. Scouts have compared him to Ryan Howard because of his size and easy power. Peter Bjarkman, who covers the Cuban league for baseballdecuba.com, said Abreu had the look of a young Mark McGwire. Adding to his value, Abreu will be part of a relatively thin free-agent class in the major leagues. So far, the San Francisco Giants have expressed interest, as have the Boston Red Sox, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Baltimore Orioles. The Mets, still looking for an impact hitter at first base, would also make an intriguing landing spot. Ike Davis, once thought to be the Mets’ first baseman of the future, spent time at Class AAA Las Vegas this season and was recently shelved with an oblique injury. Neither of his replacements, Lucas Duda and Josh Satin, inspires much confidence as a long-term solution. Abreu could be a quick — albeit expensive — fix should General Manager Sandy Alderson decide he is up for a somewhat risky bidding war. But Abreu is hardly a guarantee at the major league level. An international scout for one major league team said that Alfredo Despaigne and Frederich Cepeda, outfielders on the Cuban national team, were more dangerous hitters. An international scout for another team said that major league clubs could not afford to make a mistake when spending big on a first baseman, since it is a traditional power position filled by players who bat in the middle of the lineup. In other words, the scout said, the same money that could be used to sign Abreu might be better spent in the acquisition of one of the many established first basemen “you already know can hit big league pitching.” Image It is possible that when Abreu does sign, his deal will be the richest of any Cuban defector, topping the Dodgers’ Yasiel Puig’s $42 million. Credit Stephen Dunn/Getty Images Neither scout wanted to be quoted by name discussing a player his team might end up bidding on. Bjarkman noted that Abreu’s prodigious numbers came in a league that is leaking talent, as more and more players leave the country. Some pitchers in Cuba, he said, throw between 80 and 85 miles per hour, which is almost akin to batting practice in the majors. “His numbers in the Cuban league are great, but they came against some very mediocre pitching,” Bjarkman said. “For the national team, he dropped off a bit. If there is a question, it’s whether he can adjust as quickly to the better pitching as the Cuban players who have been so good in the majors.” Sigfredo Barros, a baseball writer for the Cuban newspaper Granma, said: “Sometimes it can be very hard to tell with the Cuban players. Not everyone can be Puig.” Right now, Abreu is working to establish residency in Haiti so he can legally work in the United States. If he came directly he could work immediately, but he would have been subject to the amateur draft and deprived of his lucrative free agency. In addition, Major League Baseball’s new interpretation of regulations from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control means Abreu will face a longer wait before he is cleared. In the past, Cuban defectors needed only to prove permanent residency in a country outside Cuba. Now baseball requires players to petition the Foreign Assets office, a process that can take several months. Praver Shapiro Sports Management, which has handled other Cubans like pitcher Livan Hernandez, will represent Abreu. Last summer, the agency negotiated a nine-year, $30 million contract for another Cuban client, Jorge Soler, who signed with the Chicago Cubs. Abreu is expected to have a showcase for scouts in the Dominican Republic this month, at which point the hype will probably grow. Where it leads remains to be seen.",

    "source": "Scores Die in Avalanches on Afghan Mountain Pass <eos> SALANG PASS, Afghanistan — Rescuers atop this treacherous mountain pass dug through piles of snow on Wednesday to extract more bodies from cars, buses and trucks buried in snow as the death toll from possibly the worst series of avalanches in Afghanistan ’s history climbed to 166. Officials are predicting that they will find more victims. On just one stretch of the buried highway, at a place known as Pul-i-Khaki, the authorities had dug out 150 bodies, frozen in their final agonies. The rescue teams piled the bodies five to a police pickup truck and took them down to a makeshift helipad to be flown out. The director of the Afghan National Disaster Management Authority, Abdul Matin Adrak, said that 300 injured people had been recovered and that 67 were in critical condition. But even in this snowy roadside graveyard, there were tales of improbable survival, like that of a 31-year-old taxi driver named Sher Muhammad. A storm had already begun on Monday when Mr. Muhammad started up this pass over the Hindu Kush mountain range in his maroon Toyota sedan, with four paying passengers. The heavy rains and ferocious winds loosened mountainfuls of snow, setting off 17 avalanches along a nine-mile-long stretch of the highway. By 9 p.m. Monday, Mr. Muhammad had reached a point just 1,000 feet below the tunnel at the top of the 12,000-foot pass, and it would prove to be the worst place of all. There was a noise like thunder and what felt like a blast, and Mr. Muhammad later told his brother that he remembered only clutching the steering wheel as the car rolled down the mountain and landed on its roof, snow piling over it. The heavily traveled highway, which links Kabul to northern Afghanistan, had been packed with traffic, and officials estimated that 100 or more vehicles had been buried on this one stretch, some of them after tumbling 500 yards down the slope. Within an hour, Mr. Muhammad’s family knew he had not made it over the pass, and they began calling his cellphone, only to get an out-of-service message. Mr. Muhammad was alive and conscious in the darkness of his buried Toyota; one of his passengers had been thrown out, and three others were injured. It took him until 3 a.m. Tuesday to find his cellphone, turn it on and call home. As he and hundreds of others lay buried, rescuers began arriving by helicopter and on foot. “We’ve had many avalanches here,” said the Parwan Province police chief, Maulana Sayedkhili. “This is the worst one ever.” Rescuers from the nearest village found a bus that had been buried, with just the rear bumper sticking out, according to one of the villagers, Azizullah (who, like many Afghans, has only one name). They started digging and found 14 people still alive, those in the back of the bus, closest to the surface. Piled beneath them were 40 dead passengers. In another car, officials found a dead woman and her seven children, all still alive. At least four other children were reported to have lost their parents in the avalanches. The governor of Parwan Province, Basir Salangi, estimated Wednesday that 50 vehicles remained buried. “There are still a lot of cars under the snow,” he said. He stamped his foot. Then he stamped it again. “It sounds hollow, there’s probably one here, too.” Rescue workers began digging there with shovels, the only tools they had, and not many of them; there were at least five workers for every shovel. They soon struck the metal of a roof. It was Wednesday afternoon, two full days after the avalanches began, before heavy equipment finally reached this point. Mr. Muhammad’s brother, Baryalai, 24, reached the pass on Tuesday. He had been on the phone all night as his buried brother tried to guide him and other family members to where he was. The car was 100 yards from the entombed bus. Just a single wheel of his taxi protruded from the snow. “The snow was blowing so hard we couldn’t even see it,” Mr. Baryalai said. “He was saying exactly where he was, he knows this road really well.” Hours passed before they found the car, and Mr. Muhammad wanted to say farewell to his family, his wife and 6-year-old son, but Mr. Baryalai said he would not allow it. “I said, ‘We’re going to get you out of here,’ ” he said. Mr. Baryalai dug out a door and pulled his brother and two survivors out. One of the passengers had already died. It was 10 a.m. on Tuesday, 13 hours after the car had been swept off the road. Mr. Muhammad was paralyzed from the waist down, apparently from frostbite. “At least he’s alive,” his brother said.",

    "source": "New V.A. Secretary Says Hiring Spree Is Needed to Meet Patient Demand <eos> WASHINGTON — The new secretary of Veterans Affairs said Monday that the department needed to hire “tens of thousands of new doctors, new nurses, new clinicians” — emphasizing the significance of a shortage of employees who are directly involved in treating patients, a factor many experts said was a main driver in the waiting-list scandal that rocked the agency this year. Yet the new secretary, Robert A. McDonald, a former chief executive of Procter & Gamble, who was unanimously confirmed by the Senate six weeks ago after the resignation of Eric Shinseki in May , acknowledged that it would be difficult to fill many of those slots. “I am worried about our ability to recruit and retain talent,” Mr. McDonald said at his first news conference at the department’s office in Washington. “The issue now is, we have to find the people.” Mr. McDonald broadly outlined other plans to fix the department’s problems, but he did not offer many specifics or go much beyond remedies that had already been outlined by the deputy secretary, Sloan D. Gibson, in the weeks after Mr. Shinseki’s departure. In addition to hiring more doctors and nurses, Mr. McDonald pledged to flatten the department’s hierarchical structure; to continue to eliminate benchmarks that had created unintended incentives to manipulate waiting-time data; to transform what some officials called a vindictive and retaliatory management culture so that it “embraces constructive dissents and welcomes critical feedback”; and to take steps to make it easier for veterans to receive care. In response to a question, Mr. McDonald even gave a room full of journalists his cellphone number. All that may prove less difficult than finding the new doctors and nurses the department needs to handle the demand from service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as from aging veterans of Vietnam and previous wars. At the same time, the department must still fill both existing vacancies and new positions created by a $17-billion plan approved by Congress this summer to stabilize the agency. The precise number of clinician slots the department already has the money to fill is not clear. In July, the department told Congress that it had almost 36,000 “clinical provider vacancies” — including more than 9,000 registered nurse vacancies and almost 4,000 physician vacancies. Over all, there were almost 46,000 vacancies across the entire veterans health care system, a vacancy rate of 15.5 percent. In some parts of the country, the shortage of doctors and nurses has been acute, and the department will have to compete in a tough job market to recruit talent. In Phoenix, for example, where a waiting-list scandal at a department medical center exploded into a national controversy, a whistle-blower, Dr. Sam Foote, has attributed long wait times to a doctor shortage. As recently as two years ago, Dr. Foote has said, as many as 15,000 veterans in Phoenix were waiting to be assigned to a primary care doctor because theirs had left or they were new to the system.",

    "source": "Before Accusations, Uber Was a Boon for Indian Women <eos> NEW DELHI — There is never a bad time to state a plain fact. Uber is a greater friend of urban women in India than the government ever was. Over the past several months, women have taken to the smartphone app with enthusiasm. They grade the drivers and convey to Uber their compliments — and their complaints about bad manners and body odor. Many rate the Uber experience higher than sitting in their own chauffeur-driven cars because the relationship between the driver in front and the female employer in back is often filled with the chauffeur’s melancholic stories about the health of his children, which lead to requests for loans and time off from work. And there is the issue of his judgmental gaze at her clothes and ways. Also, as he spends most of his day playing cards with other drivers, he passes on a considerable amount of information about his employer — information that is sometimes tapped by the neighbors. Uber’s drivers, on the other hand, are transient and have no incentive to whine. And, until Friday night, they were considered very safe. An Uber driver told me that they were considered so safe that boyfriends “could drink and dance with” their girlfriends “all night and didn’t have to drop them home — they just put them in Uber.” All that changed on Friday night. A young woman in New Delhi has alleged that she was raped by an Uber driver. After her complaint, the police could not figure out how to contact a human from Uber until an officer downloaded the app and used it to hail a car. He asked the driver to take him to Uber’s office. It would be hours before the police got any useful information. The man accused of rape was eventually detained. It turned out that he had been accused of the same crime at least twice before, but was acquitted in one case and granted bail in the other. Most of Uber’s cabs in India are run through third-party contractors who own and manage fleets of cars. They are required by Uber to check their drivers’ backgrounds, a process that mostly involves procuring a certificate from the police stating that the person in question has no criminal record — a largely meaningless exercise because such certification is routinely obtained through bribes of less than $10. I spoke to several Uber drivers who said their “police verification” was bought in this manner. Some said their backgrounds were not checked at all. Video In January, The New York Times interviewed Uber’s C.E.O., Travis Kalanick, about the ride-sharing company’s business practices, including liability in accidents. Credit Credit Jack Atley for The New York Times The driver accused of rape had a police certificate that said he was “not involved in any criminal offense as per the records of” one police station in New Delhi. The police have said that the certificate was forged. Even if it were genuine it would not surprise anyone in India. A rapist’s best ally is the corrupt government official. The government may be complicit in this alleged crime, but it has pretended that the problem is an app. On Monday, the Delhi region’s Transport Department banned Uber and its Indian clones and declared their operations in the National Capital Region illegal on various grounds. But I have been riding in Uber cabs since the ban was announced, and even as I write this column on Tuesday the cars are available. One driver showed me a text message on his mobile phone that he said was from Uber. The message asked him not to lose faith in the service “in these difficult times” and said Uber would continue to operate. Uber is staying put, and by making it illicit, the government has probably relieved it of the pressure to ensure the safety of its users. India’s best-known economics writer, Swaminathan Anklesaria Aiyar, told me that Uber “is a company that does not have a moral compass, but it does serve the society.” For many years, until the recent arrival of radio cabs, taking a taxi or an auto-rickshaw in India was an act of accepting defeat. The customer was often cheated and the drivers were unruly. So in India, unlike in some American and European cities, Uber does not have to contend with nostalgia. It has been, in a way, a liberator.

    "source": "Solar Meets Polar as Winter Curbs Clean Energy <eos> Old Man Winter, it turns out, is no friend of renewable energy. This time of year, wind turbine blades ice up, biodiesel congeals in tanks and solar panels produce less power because there is not as much sun. And perhaps most irritating to the people who own them, the panels become covered with snow, rendering them useless even in bright winter sunshine. So in regions where homeowners have long rolled their eyes at shoveling driveways, add another cold-weather chore: cleaning off the solar panels. “At least I can get to them with a long pole and a squeegee,” said Alan Stankevitz, a homeowner in southeast Minnesota. As concern has grown about global warming , many utilities and homeowners have been trying to shrink their emissions of carbon dioxide — their carbon footprints — by installing solar panels, wind turbines and even generators powered by tides or rivers. But for the moment, at least, the planet is still cold enough to deal nasty winter blows to some of this green machinery. In January 2007, a bus stalled in the middle of the night on Interstate 70 in the Colorado mountains. The culprit was a 20 percent biodiesel blend that congealed in the freezing weather, according to John Jones, the transit director for the bus line, Summit Stage. (Biodiesel is a diesel substitute, typically made from vegetable oil, that is used to displace some fossil fuels.) The passengers got out of that situation intact, but Summit Stage, which serves ski resorts, now avoids biodiesel from November to March, and uses only a 5 percent blend in the summertime, when it can still get cold in the mountains. “We can’t have people sitting on buses freezing to death while we get out there trying to get them restarted,” Mr. Jones said. Winter may pose even bigger safety hazards in the vicinity of wind turbines. Some observers say the machines can hurl chunks of ice as they rotate. “It’s like you throw a plate out there and that plate breaks,” said Ralph Brokaw, a cattle rancher in southeast Wyoming who has 69 wind turbines on his property. When his turbines ice up, he stays out of the way. The wind industry admits that turbines can drop ice, like a lamppost or any tall structure. To ameliorate the hazard, some turbines are painted black to absorb sunlight and melt the ice faster. But Ron Stimmel, an expert on small wind turbines at the American Wind Energy Association, denies that the whirling blades tend to hurl icy javelins. Large turbines turn off automatically as ice builds up, and small turbines will slow and stop because the ice prevents them from spinning — “just like a plane’s wing needs to be de-iced to fly,” Mr. Stimmel said. Mr. Brokaw says that his turbines do turn off when they are too icy, but the danger sometimes comes right before the turbines shut down, after a wet, warm snow causes ice buildup. From the standpoint of generating power, winter is actually good for wind turbines, because it is generally windier than summer. In Vermont, for example, Green Mountain Power, which operates a small wind farm in the southeastern part of the state, gets more than twice the monthly production in winter as in August. The opposite is true, however, for solar power . Days are shorter and the sun is lower in the sky during the winter, ensuring less power production. Even in northern California, with mild winters and little snow, solar panels can generate about half as much as in the summer, depending on how much they are tilted, according to Rob Erlichman, chief executive of Sunlight Electric, a San Francisco solar company. Operators of the electrical grid do not worry much about the seasonal swings, because the percentage of production from renewable energy is still so low — around 1 percent of the country’s power comes from wind, and less from solar panels. In addition, Americans use slightly less electricity in the winter than in the summer because air conditioners are not running. This is especially true in sunny areas, so solar panels’ peak production matches the spikes in demand. But as renewable energy becomes a bigger part of the nation’s power mix, the seasonable variability could become more of a problem. Already, power developers are learning that they must make careful plans to avoid the worst impacts of ice and snow. Trey Taylor, the president of Verdant Power, which has put small turbines in the tidal East River in New York City and plans more for the St. Lawrence River in Canada, said that ice chunks could slide over one another “like a deck of cards,” pushing ice below and harming turbines. That may rule out parts of otherwise promising sites like the Yukon River in Alaska, he said. Kevin Devlin, the vice president for operations of Iberdrola Renewables, a wind developer, said that winter was probably the hardest time of year to maintain turbines, because workers must go out in snow and ice. Occasionally, he said, the turbines will shut down or set off alarms if it is too cold, and workers must brave the elements to fix them. For homeowners, the upkeep of their power sources can also be a bother. Mr. Stankevitz keeps his panels tilted 40 degrees or higher, but they still become covered with snow — and experts say that if even one cell in a panel is covered, the panel will not produce power. On the other hand, the panels can get extra power from sunlight reflected off nearby snow. And like other electronic gear, solar panels work better when cold. Mr. Stankevitz said that on some rare winter days, when the Minnesota sky is clear, the weather is freezing and the sun is shining brightly, his panels can briefly churn out more electricity than they were designed to produce, more than on the balmiest days of summer.",

    "source": "U.S. Plans to Put Advisers on Front Lines of Nigeria’s War on Boko Haram <eos> DAKAR, Senegal — The Pentagon is poised to send dozens of Special Operations advisers to the front lines of Nigeria’s fight against the West African militant group Boko Haram, according to military officials, the latest deployment in conflicts with the Islamic State and its allies. Their deployment would push American troops hundreds of miles closer to the battle that Nigerian forces are waging against an insurgency that has killed thousands of civilians in the country’s northeast as well as in neighboring Niger, Chad and Cameroon. By some measures, Boko Haram is the world’s deadliest terrorist group. The deployment is a main recommendation of a recent confidential assessment by the top United States Special Operations commander for Africa, Brig. Gen. Donald C. Bolduc. If it is approved, as expected, by the Defense and State Departments, the Americans would serve only in noncombat advisory roles, military officials said. Even as President Obama has drawn down the large American armies sent to Iraq and Afghanistan, he has relied heavily on Special Operations forces to train and advise local troops fighting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and to carry out clandestine counterterrorism missions. Already, about 50 American commandos are advising fighters battling the Islamic State in eastern Syria. Scores more in a new, secret kill-or-capture unit are hunting Islamic State militants in Iraq. The Pentagon has offered to send American advisers with Iraqi brigades on the battlefield instead of restricting them to bases inside Iraq. Dozens of American commandos are conducting surveillance missions in Libya and counterterrorism missions in Somalia. “Rather than entangle U.S. combat forces on the ground, help build the capacity of regional forces to tackle their countries’ security challenges,” said Jennifer G. Cooke, Africa director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, who visited Nigeria last month. “Training and advising and perhaps imparting the lessons we learned the hard way is a good thing.” Since taking office last year, Nigeria’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, has vowed to pursue a military campaign against Boko Haram more vigorously than his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan. His shake-up of the military high command and new cooperation with neighboring countries has proved effective. Mr. Buhari, a former general, has boasted of the military’s successes in wresting control of a huge portion of terrain from the group, declaring a “technical” victory late last year. But while the military has killed or captured thousands of militants and put an end to raids of villages by dozens or more fighters, the group has still carried out suicide attacks at a relentless pace in Nigeria and neighboring countries. “Despite losing territory in 2015, Boko Haram will probably remain a threat to Nigeria throughout 2016 and will continue its terror campaign within the country and in neighboring Cameroon, Niger and Chad,” James R. Clapper, the director of national intelligence, told the House Intelligence Committee in Washington on Thursday. To help combat this threat, Mr. Buhari has embraced American assistance, ending several years of tense relations that sank to new lows in 2014 when the United States blocked the sale of American-made Cobra attack helicopters to Nigeria from Israel, amid concerns about Nigeria’s protection of civilians when conducting military operations. Groups like Human Rights Watch say the Nigerian military has at times burned hundreds of homes and committed other abuses as it battled Boko Haram and its presumed supporters. Image A Nigerian Army soldier in Lagos last year. Credit Stefan Heunis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Nigeria’s ambassador to the United States responded sharply at the time, accusing Washington of hampering the country’s effort to defeat Boko Haram. American officials also expressed hesitancy about sharing intelligence with the Nigerian military, fearing their ranks had been infiltrated by Boko Haram, an accusation that further infuriated Nigerian leaders. In December 2014, Nigeria canceled the last stage of American training of a new Nigerian Army battalion that was to take the lead in fighting terrorists. Those days now seem over. This month Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the State Department’s top diplomat for Africa, announced that the suspended training for the Nigerian infantry battalion would resume soon. Nigeria will provide the ammunition. Two weeks ago, Gen. David M. Rodriguez, the head of the Pentagon’s Africa Command, hosted Nigeria’s chief of defense staff, Gen. Abayomi Gabriel Olonisakin, at the American headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. “To contain Boko Haram, working together is a priority,” General Rodriguez told his visitor. About 250 American service members have deployed to a military base in Garoua, Cameroon, where United States surveillance drones flying over northeastern Nigeria are sending imagery to African troops. Drone photos recently helped the Nigerian Army avoid a major Boko Haram ambush, according to a senior American intelligence officer. Another breakthrough occurred late last year when General Bolduc, a Green Beret with multiple Special Forces tours in Afghanistan, visited Nigeria. When officials there asked for assistance, General Bolduc quickly sent an assessment team to conduct a 30-day review. Among the team’s main recommendations was to position “small dozens” of Special Forces in Maiduguri, a major city in the northeast on the edge of the conflict, to help Nigerian military planners carry out a more effective counterterrorism campaign. British special forces are already assisting in the city. (The American military now maintains only a tiny intelligence cell in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital.) Nigerian military officials have embraced the recommendations and are drawing up detailed requests, American officials said. Just last fall, life seemed to be turning back to normal in the areas near Maiduguri, which for years had been the epicenter of Boko Haram’s activities. But after a major military operation uprooted the militants from nearby villages they had seized, many fighters have returned to Maiduguri to launch repeated suicide bombing operations in the city or in villages on the outskirts that have caused dozens of deaths. At the end of last year, fighters attacked the city with rocket-propelled grenades and several suicide bombs. Residents say they eye one another with suspicion, especially women wearing religious gowns, fearful that explosives may be hidden underneath. These relentless attacks have put more pressure on Nigeria and its neighbors to marshal their forces against a common enemy. After taking office last year, Mr. Buhari began forging relationships with the presidents of neighboring countries to establish information-sharing and to build trust between his nation and Niger, Cameroon and Chad. But grouping the four nations together to share information and untangling decades of mistrust among them have proved harder. A regional task force established by the countries last year has largely stalled amid lingering distrust and differing views about the threat. Less than half of the task force’s $700 million budget has been raised, and sinking oil prices have hurt the economies of Chad and Nigeria, Ms. Cooke said in congressional testimony this week. Still, working together has yielded victories. Earlier this month, the Cameroonians teamed up with the Nigerian military as part of a joint operation on Nigerian soil just across the border in the far north, killing more than 160 Boko Haram fighters, dismantling a logistics hub for the fighters and destroying explosive devices, according to officials there.",

    "source": "Pope Benedict Meets Saudi King at Vatican <eos> ROME, Nov. 6 — Pope Benedict XVI and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia clasped hands at the Vatican on Tuesday in the first official meeting between a pope and a Saudi monarch, who is entrusted to protect Mecca, the birthplace of Muhammad and the center of the Islamic world. The two met for half an hour, speaking through interpreters, in a conversation that a Vatican news release said had been cordial and had covered the “value of collaboration between Christians, Muslims and Jews for promoting peace” and “the necessity of finding a just solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, among other themes. Marco Politi, the Vatican correspondent for the Italian daily La Repubblica and a biographer of Pope John Paul II, said, “I think it is extraordinarily important that an official communiqué from the Vatican and an important Islamic state like Saudi Arabia mentions ‘cooperation’ between Christians Muslims and Jews — not dialogue but cooperation.” The meeting, presaged by an upbeat front-page article in L’Osservatore Romano, the Vatican’s newspaper, was also a clear attempt by the Vatican to repair damage done by the pope’s 2006 statement on Islam, which the Arab world had seen as insensitive if not incendiary. In a speech in Regensburg, Germany, in September 2006, Benedict quoted a 14th-century Byzantine emperor who called Islam “evil and inhuman.” The comment led to protests in Islamic nations, and prompted some Islamic states to recall their Vatican ambassadors. Firebombers attacked churches in the West Bank and Gaza, gunmen killed an Italian nun in Somalia, and the pope was threatened. The Vatican expressed “deepest regrets” but said the remark had been misinterpreted in a way that “absolutely did not correspond” to the pope’s intentions. The article in the Vatican newspaper seemed to open the door for a diplomatic initiative toward Islam and the Middle East. It said the meeting with Abdullah was “of great importance.” “In a world where the boundaries have become day by day more open, dialogue is not a choice but a necessity,” it said. The article also acknowledged that some weeks ago Pope Benedict had received a letter from 138 Islamic religious leaders from 43 nations, appealing for more dialogue between Christians and Muslims. As the weeks went by with no response, some scholars here had complained that the pope seemed slow to address an important appeal. The Vatican allayed those fears on Tuesday. The meeting represents a triumph of sorts for Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, and especially for Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran, president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue. Cardinal Tauran, who previously served the church in Lebanon and Syria, is familiar with the Middle East and has promoted greater contact with Islamic states. But official statements issued Tuesday did not mention establishing diplomatic relations between the Vatican and Saudi Arabia, and it was not clear that the topic was even discussed. In May, the United Arab Emirates became the latest Islamic country to establish diplomatic relations with the Vatican, the Vatican newspaper said. One reason the Vatican wants to forge diplomatic relations in the Middle East, or at least increase its diplomatic influence there, is the presence of significant Roman Catholic populations in predominantly Muslim countries. Almost all are guest workers from elsewhere. The Vatican noted that 1.5 million Christians are in Saudi Arabia, the majority of them Catholics from the Philippines. The State Department has criticized Saudi Arabia for religious intolerance and persecution of non-Muslims. “Charges of harassment, abuse and even killings at the hands of the Muttawa (religious police) continue to surface,” the department said in a report issued this year. But little sign of tension was evident Tuesday. The pope gave the king a 16th-century engraving of the Vatican and a gold medal with his seal. The king gave the pope a sword, telling him it was “made of gold and precious stones.” In 1999, long before becoming king, Abdullah met Benedict’s predecessor, John Paul II, who also met other prominent Muslim leaders, including, in 1999, Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric who was president of Iran.",

Performers include Sam Moore, one half of the ’60s R&B and soul duo Sam & Dave, and The Piano Guys. Both acts performed at a welcome concert for Mr. Trump on Thursday. The armed services ball will feature a performance by the singer Tony Orlando and the Texas musician Josh Weathers. If you thought getting a ticket was tough ... 6:55 p.m.: The idea of an inaugural ball might sound fun, but let’s talk about how hard it is to actually get into these events. Guests have to walk several blocks through a labyrinth of security fences, road barriers and a human wall of police officers dressed in riot gear in front of the convention center. (Several women are cursing their decision to wear high heels.) Empty city buses and garbage trucks are establishing a loose perimeter around the convention center. They are likely parked here to safeguard against bomb blasts. At the end of the long lines, a set of metal detectors await. It’s hard to keep a festive mood with the sounds of helicopters flying low overhead and the sight of the occasional protester with signs that read “resist extermination,” but these revelers are managing to do it somehow. “Trump’s going to be here, it’s a great day, let’s enjoy it,” a woman said as she joined the line of people waiting to get into the Freedom Ball. Freedom isn’t free, and neither are the drinks 7:51 p.m.: Things are in full swing at the Freedom Ball, where the festivities were supposed to begin around 8 p.m. Attendees are enjoying a buffet of pasta and rolls. After a $20 glass of champagne (cash bar), we’re ready to mingle. If there’s one big fashion theme emerging, it’s that these revelers enjoy their sequins. One ballgoer, 26-year-old Ashley Walukevich, chose a dress with silver sequins and embellishments down the sleeves after searching for a week for the right look. She posed with a friend, Lauren Hodge, who chose a dress made of black velvet and lace. Aside from trying to hail an Uber driver who got trapped by protesters, Ms. Walukevich said the protests around Washington haven’t bothered her. “I wanted to come out to celebrate our country coming together,” she said, “and to celebrate our new president.” Into the swing of things 8 p.m.: The concert at the Freedom Ball has started. The singer Tim Rushlow, who performed as part of the Frontmen of Country at the “Make America Great Again” concert on Thursday, appeared with His Big Band to the convention center. He opened the show by heralding a “landslide victory and an amazing time for our president.” (Mr. Trump has also called his victory a landslide, despite losing the popular vote.) The swing jazz group opened with Frank Sinatra’s “That’s Life,” a melancholy hit about persevering though life’s ups and downs. As Sinatra said, “I’ve been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king.” Mr. Trump would disagree . Dueling pianos 8:23 p.m.: With two balls in one building, and with guests at one ball separated from guests at the other, acts were performing both on stage and on large screens. At the Freedom Ball, The Piano Guys, introduced as “four musical dads from Utah,” played covers of pop music songs, including Rachel Platten’s “Fight Song.” — which Hillary Clinton used as an anthem during the campaign. While The Piano Guys played on stage, a squad of 18 Rockettes danced on screen (with the sound muted), dressed in gold-sequined outfits and glittery tights.

Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times This company of women had been at the center of a media firestorm since December when the Madison Square Garden Co., the group that manages them, committed the dancers to perform at the inauguration, even though some members dissented. At the ball, however, the women performed with their trademark precision. Their smiles, of course, were huge. The people’s parties 8:35 p.m.: Instead of focusing on A-list artists — which the inauguration committee struggled to book anyway — the entertainment here is centered on what might be called “classic American” music. In other words: lots of Frank Sinatra covers. It also turns out the performers are alternating between the two stages at the convention center. It’s a little disorienting, but the guests don’t seem to mind. Image People waiting for President Trump and his wife, Melania, at the Freedom Ball on Friday. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times The Rockettes are at the Freedom Ball now, in Uncle Sam outfits. Despite the celebrity snafus, the Trump team wants to make one thing clear: The Freedom and Liberty balls are about the people. Tickets were $50 each, according to the Presidential Inaugural Committee, much lower than the cost of other balls happening around town this weekend. The committee raised more than $100 million for the inauguration over all. Where’s the President? 9 p.m.: This ball shuts down in two hours and the president and vice president are still no-shows. That didn’t bother Trump supporters like Tye Hill, a Republican from Indiana, who stood in a plum-colored gown as she waited for the night’s headliners to arrive. “Right off the bat, when I heard Trump, I knew he spoke for me,” she said. “He’s conservative. He’s promised jobs, he’s promised immigration reform.” She added: “And I’m going to hold him to it.” Their first dance as first couple 9:36 p.m. : President and Mrs. Trump emerged at the Liberty Ball shortly after 9:30, and Mr. Trump sounded familiar themes from his postelection speeches when he addressed the crowd. “They said we — and me — we didn’t have a chance, but we knew we were going to win, and we won,” the president said. “Today we had a great day,” he continued. “People that weren’t so nice to me were saying that we did a really good job today. They hated to do it, but they did it.” Though it had appeared to begin raining just as Mr. Trump was sworn in at noon, he apparently did not notice. The rain held off until the dignitaries had moved inside, Mr. Trump said. “It was like God was looking down on us, I will tell you,” he added. Meanwhile, a crowd formed near video screens at the Freedom Ball to watch Mr. Trump dance with the new first lady, who wore an architectural off-the-shoulder white sheath with a high slit, a thin burgundy bow belt, and a silk organza wave curving from one dropped sleeve to the opposite hip, and then down the skirt. The video was muted as ballgoers watched the couple sway to a cover of “My Way” (Sinatra again!). Image President Trump and his wife, Melania, danced for the first time after the inauguration to “My Way.” Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Despite dancing to a song about the bittersweet struggle and ultimate reward of individuality, this president apparently likes to double date. Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, were invited to the stage. And then, of course, the whole Trump clan joined in. The scene was a flurry of nude-toned dresses and very slow swaying. Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka wore a champagne-colored fairy princess gown covered in sparkles by Carolina Herrera. At the end, the families bowed and beamed, signaling the end of the show. For this ball, at least. A dress makes waves 10:08 p.m.: Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, reports that Mrs. Trump’s dress is a collaboration between herself and Hervé Pierre, a former chief designer for Carolina Herrera who also worked at Oscar de la Renta. Image President Trump and his wife, Melania, making their entrance at the Freedom Ball. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times The first lady’s choice to wear a powder-blue Ralph Lauren to the swearing-in ceremony both nodded to the American establishment and referenced history. Her look was reminiscent of Jacqueline Kennedy , a first lady whose clothing choices became synonymous with classic American style. Having it ‘My Way’ 10:19 p.m.: Mr. Trump arrived at the Freedom Ball and greeted the crowd with “Howdy folks” and a few more well-worn remarks. His supporters, it seems, think he should keep his personal Twitter account. “Should I keep the Twitter going or not?” the president asked. The crowd said yes. “The enemies keep saying, ‘Oh, that’s terrible,’” Mr. Trump said, “but it’s a way of bypassing dishonest media, right? If the opening dance at the Freedom Ball looked a lot like what happened at the Liberty Ball, that’s because it was about exactly the same. After what seemed like a momentary audio glitch, “My Way” was back on the sound system. The Trumps were once again joined by the Pences and — all together now! — the rest of the Trump clan. Now it’s time to head to the National Building Museum, where Mr. Trump and the gang will attend the Armed Services Ball. On to the final ball 10:54 p.m.: After a leisurely walk though several blocks of security barricades and a screening by a few friendly Secret Service agents and police officers, we have arrived to catch the tail end of the Salute to Our Armed Services Ball, where Mr. Trump is expected to speak. This black-tie affair was the harder ticket to get, and about half of the guests here are members of the military in full dress. Unlike the last one, this ball is open bar. There is no music right now and the crowd is lingering to hear Mr. Trump speak. The new commander-in-chief 11:15 p.m.: Arriving at around 11, Mr. Trump greeted supporters at the armed services ball by praising law enforcement and the military. “I like you for a lot of reasons. Also I like the fact that you all voted for me,” Mr. Trump told the crowd. They laughed and cheered. Image The first couple dancing at the Salute to Our Armed Services Ball. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times A live feed of troops in Afghanistan was projected on the screen. “How is it over there? How’s it going?” asked the new commander-in-chief. “I like them much better than I like the media,” he said of the troops. “These are much nicer people, finer people.” “Don’t be like these people — don’t be too tough on me,” Mr. Trump told them, gesturing toward the news media corralled in the stands. (This reporter somehow managed to skirt the entrance and found a spot somewhere near the open bar.) Image President Trump and Melania Trump speaking with members of the military at the National Building Museum. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Mrs. Trump then spoke publicly for the first time on Inauguration Day. “Thank you all for your service,” she told the attendees. “I’m honored to be your first lady. We will fight, we will win, we will make America great again.” The couple chose a different song to dance to this time, a cover of “I Will Always Love You.” Signing off 11:22 p.m.: After dancing alongside each other for the third time tonight, the president and vice president together used a saber to cut through a giant red, white and blue cake. Image President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence cutting a cake at the Salute to Our Armed Services Ball. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times And with that, it’s time to sign off.

    "source": "Discovering Concavenator Corcovatus, the Dinosaur With a Hump <eos> Researchers have discovered the most complete fossil of a meat-eating dinosaur from Europe in Las Hoyas, Spain. Curiously, it is humpbacked. The study appears in the journal Nature . Named Concavenator corcovatus, the dinosaur belongs to the theropod family. In most ways, the dinosaur is not unusual, and it shares many characteristics with other medium-size theropods. But the humplike structure on the 20-foot creature has previously never been seen in a dinosaur. “We have no idea if this hump had flesh tissues; if so it could have been a fatlike deposit,” said Francisco Ortega, a biologist at the Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia and the study’s lead author. “Or if it was decoration, it was used as a display.” The hump probably looked similar to that seen on some cows today, he said. The fossil also suggests that the dinosaur had bony bumps on its limbs, possibly structures from which feathers protruded. The dinosaur lived during the Early Cretaceous period, about 130 million years ago. Earlier dinosaur fossils have shown evidence of feathers, and birds are now generally considered to be dinosaur descendants. He and his colleagues uncovered the dinosaur in a 2003 dig, but the assembly and analysis took seven years. The complete fossil can be seen at the Museum of Science in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain.",

    "source": "Alaska’s Rural Schools Fight Extinction <eos> NIKOLSKI, Alaska — This distant dot in the Aleutian Islands needed just 10 students for its school to dodge a fatal cut from the state budget. It reached across Alaska and beyond but could find only nine. Built by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1939, the little Nikolski School will not be the last in Alaska to close. Four others have closed this fall and at least 30 more are at risk because of dwindling enrollment; one school in remote southeast Alaska survived only by advertising on Craigslist for families with school-aged children. “We lose one or two every year,” said Eddy Jeans, the director of school finance for the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development. As Alaska celebrates its 50th anniversary of statehood amid new political prominence and urban aspirations, it is confronting a legacy of loss in rural communities that are unlike any others in the United States . Some of these communities, like Nikolski, are linked to the earliest human settlements in North America , yet are now buckling beneath the accumulated conflict of old versus new. Alaska Natives are increasingly leaving villages for cities. Young women, in particular, have departed, and birth rates, once disproportionately higher in villages, have dropped. Jobs for the young people who remain are declining. Village elders have fewer peers who share their dialects. Heating fuel, gasoline and groceries can be expensive and medical services minimal. The annual statewide student counting period, completed last month, is a census of the exodus. After several decades of growth, the overall rural population has declined about 4 percent since 2000 and much more in many regions. In the Aleutians, the population is down 19 percent, to about 4,500. About 20 percent of Alaska’s 680,000 people live in rural areas. Rural school districts, desperate to make the cut, are known to move students between schools to prop up enrollment during the counting period, while some have sought out families willing to relocate from other states. “We were desperate,” said Gordon Chew, whose wife runs the school in Tenakee Springs, where two families with a total of six children relocated earlier this year in response to an advertisement on Craigslist. “That saved us.”The decline of rural schools is at the heart of a broader debate in Alaska over the treatment of native communities, which dominate the state’s rural population. Here in the Aleutians, native Unangans, or Aleuts, are linked to people who traveled the Bering land bridge from Asia more than 10,000 years ago. They survived off the sea, making skiffs from seal skin and building houses from sod for shelter against the endless ocean gales. They endured violence and religious conversion by Russian explorers and, during World War II, forced evacuation by the American military. Now they face budget cuts and the pressures of modern Alaska. “If you put it in the calculus we use today to determine public policy, places like Nikolski probably have a difficult time measuring up,” said Byron Mallott, a Tlingit leader who has advised several Alaska governors on native issues. “But look at Nikolski in the context of Alaska, look at it in the context of America. These are the native homelands, and we ought to recognize that and not forget that.” Concerns over the cost and quality of education in rural areas have long generated tension: can preserving village life be balanced with preparing students for a broader world? A court settlement in the 1970s required the state to build high schools in most villages, prompting an expensive construction boom. But by 1998, with oil revenues no longer soaring, the State Legislature decided that schools with fewer than 10 students would face severe cuts in financing. With some parents leaving villages in pursuit of better education anyway, some lawmakers said saving schools was missing the point. “Schools may close, but the fact of the matter is, we’re in the education business,” said Gary Wilken, a former Republican state senator from Fairbanks who pushed for the higher enrollment requirement. “Our state has to provide a quality education to all, and sometimes you can do it better through the Internet with home school programs or in regional boarding schools.” For some, more recent standardized tests showing relatively poor performance among rural and native students have confirmed skepticism over investing in declining schools. Others have pressed more aggressively than ever for schools to nurture fading native cultures and languages, once banished in the name of education. Georgianna Lincoln, 66, a former Democratic state senator who lived in the village of Rampart, northwest of Fairbanks, until she was 9, was among the lawmakers who fought raising the financing threshold to 10 students. The school in Rampart closed shortly after the new requirement was imposed. After the vote, Ms. Lincoln recalled: “I told everybody, ‘I don’t care if you import your cousins or your friends. Do not allow the school to close because that’s the death of the community.’ ” Larry LeDoux, Alaska’s commissioner of the Department of Education and Early Development, noted that the state had just filled a new position, director of rural education, but he also said that did not mean the state would try to save village schools. Nikolski , nearly 1,000 miles southwest of Anchorage, is the last of what once were more than 20 native villages on Umnak Island. A few decades ago, the village had 80 people; it is now down to about 30. Enrollment here fell below 10 last year, but the Aleutian Region School District stretched its budget and kept the school open. To run the school with 10 students for one year costs $400,000 to $500,000. By last spring, enrollment had fallen further but there was new optimism: Yuki and Maria Iaulualu, natives of American Samoa , agreed to move here from Seattle with their five school-age children. Joe Beckford, the district superintendent, arranged for the district to pay several thousand dollars for the Iaulualus’ airfare. Yet Mr. Iaulualu soon lost his job working for the village, and it became clear that even his family’s arrival would not raise enrollment to 10. Now, Mr. Iaulualu said, “we’re out of here.” Grace Oomittuk, the village health aide, and her two school-aged children came from the state’s north coast two years ago. Consulting with Mr. Beckford, she timed their initial visit to coincide with the student counting period. Now, Ms. Oomittuk said, her family will most likely move to her mother’s home in Palmer, about 40 miles northeast of Anchorage . Another student, Ivan Krukoff, 18, whose father lives in Nikolski, has moved back in with his mother on a neighboring island. If only his cousin, Darin Krukoff, 17, had been open to Mr. Beckford’s efforts to “entice him,” as the superintendent put it, to move to Nikolski. That would have made 10. But Darin likes the neighboring island, where the school has a basketball team and other attractions, including girls his age. “You have to live your life,” Darin said. That gets to Eric Willhite. He is 13 . Nobody had to ask him to prop up ancient Alaska. He is from here, a descendant of generations of seal hunters and salmon fishermen. The Black Eyed Peas thump through his iPod . His hoodie helps cut the wind that roars across the Bering Sea. He longs for middle school cool at the edge of America. “I don’t want to leave,” he said. After moving to Missouri with his parents several years ago, Eric decided he preferred life in the village and returned after a year to live with his aunt and uncle. He has heard the stories of how his grandfather was punished in school for speaking Unangan. He says he understands that he is now the only child left in Nikolski with a direct connection to the native bones and artifacts anthropologists have taken from its tundra. While he says this is home, flight is his obsession. He simulates takeoffs on a computer and makes jets out of Legos. His goal is to follow his older brother, Daniel, 19, to a vocational boarding school in interior Alaska. “He could fly pilot,” Eric said, “and I’ll fly co-pilot.” First he needs to pass the eighth grade. After spending several weeks this fall uncertain whether the Nikolski School would remain open, he is now in a home-school program. “This is a crucial year for Eric, and things aren’t going well,” said Scott Kerr, Eric’s uncle and legal guardian. Mr. Kerr is not native, but he is largely responsible for perpetuating native traditions in Eric’s life, from hunting and fishing for food to finding peace in Umnak’s isolation. “I’ve told him, ‘If you have nothing else in this world, you are Unangan, you are Aleut,’ ” Mr. Kerr said. “That’s something to be proud of.” The few people who remain here still gather in the evening on the rocky beach of Nikolski Bay to fish for dinner or something to salt for winter. Volcanoes loom, one dormant, one not. Eagles coast. Sea otters float. Cattle wander the hills, wild descendants of a long-ago ranch and, now, a particularly good meal. Foxes poke through the small landfill. At one end of the village, elders recently reburied bones of their ancestors, reclaimed from various collections. At the other, the shell of an old Reeve Aleutian airliner sits beside the gravel runway, wreckage from a 1965 flight caught in crosswinds. The school is in the middle, the newest relic. “That school,” said Arnold Dushkin, president of the Nikolski village council, “is our major reason for the village to be going.”",

    "source": "Federal Reserve to Unveil a Redesigned $100 Bill <eos> WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve will begin circulating a new $100 bill on Tuesday with some modern and colorful anti-counterfeiting features, after overcoming problems that postponed its debut for more than two and a half years. In addition to traditional safeguards like a paper blend that would be difficult to duplicate, the redesigned note will have two new features: a three-dimensional blue strip with images that appear to move when the note is tilted, and an image of a copper inkwell containing a holographic bell whose color changes when tilted. The note is the last United States currency denomination to undergo the “ New Color of Money ” face-lift that started with the $20 note in 2003, introducing subtle hues and other security features to paper currency as part of efforts to stay ahead of counterfeiters. Image The new type of $100 note, the most counterfeited currency outside America, arrives Tuesday. Credit Bureau of Engraving and Printing “It only takes a few seconds for people — if they know what they’re looking for — to know what they’re looking at is genuine,” said Michael J. Lambert, associate director of the Federal Reserve. The $100 bill is an especially hot item on the global stage: The Federal Reserve estimates that one-half to two-thirds of $100 notes in circulation are abroad at any given time, making them one of the nation’s largest exports. As a result, the $100 bill is the most commonly counterfeited note outside the United States. Mr. Lambert said officials at the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and the Secret Service had devoted extra time to redesigning it and spreading the word — including on newmoney.gov , which is available in 23 languages — with that in mind. The note took more than a decade to develop. It was originally scheduled for release in February 2011, but about four months before its debut the Federal Reserve said that an unanticipated printing problem had caused some notes to be creased and thus unfit for circulation. Investigating and resolving the issue meant there would not have been enough bills ready by February. Another printing problem caused ink to smear. The inspector general’s office at the Treasury Department released a report in 2012 attributing the delay to “a production failure that potentially could have been avoided and has already resulted in increased costs.” Image The Federal Reserve will begin circulating a new $100 bill on Tuesday with some modern and colorful anti-counterfeiting features. Experts say the efforts appear to have paid off. “I would say it’s absolutely worthwhile to do whatever it takes to make sure that we have the best currency that we can,” said Benjamin Mazzotta of Tufts University, an expert on the cost of currency. “That’s something that’s not going to be able to be reproduced on a photocopy machine, that’s for sure, or even on the computer,” said Dennis Forgue, a currency expert in Chicago. But the transition may not be seamless everywhere. When the United States issued a new $100 note in 1996, for instance, Russians — accustomed to a system in which old currency becomes worthless — worried that there would not be enough bills to meet demand. While older United States currency retains its value, Mr. Forgue said that overseas, especially in Eastern European countries, people may demand the newest bills as the only acceptable form of payment. “They’re afraid of getting stuck with something that’s not good because they’ve gone through so many changes like that,” he said. Mr. Lambert said the Federal Reserve was prepared. “We stand ready to get them the notes that they need, and obviously our goal and our objective is to meet the demand,” he said. “Whether that’s international or domestic, it doesn’t matter.”",

    "source": "Queens as a Tourist Destination? Readers React <eos> An article Wednesday on the rising number of tourists visiting Queens — attributed to the Lonely Planet guidebook’s designating the borough to be the No. 1 travel destination in the country this year — attracted reader responses from along the No. 7 train line and beyond. Some could not believe what they read. “I believe the end-time prophecy of the Book of Revelation calls for the appearance of the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse, the 7th Seal, and the Beast, all to be followed by Queens and Staten Island becoming hip,” said EDG of New York . “We’re apparently up to Queens.” Many Queens residents, present and former, wondered why The New York Times blew open their secret. “The reason why Queens was so great was because there were no tourists. And now, it will be ruined,” said TJ of New York . “Keep tourists out of Queens please! And stop giving them tips on places to visit! Whenever I have out-of-town guests I literally make them swear on their mother’s grave that they will not under any circumstances tell anyone about my ‘secret’ places,” said Betti of New York . “Does Queens really need a bunch of tourists going to Roosevelt Avenue and gawking at all the brown, yellow and black people? It’s not a zoo, you know,” said a Queens native, Admiral Halsey . Others expressed a common fear of that great arbiter of gentrification, artisanal mayonnaise, once the word gets out. “And with the tourists, let’s welcome the developers that will try, no doubt, to create the next Brooklyn in Queens. Let’s thank Lonely Planet in five years for giving the kiss of death to all the cultural diversity and mom and pop shops that they put out once they jack up the prices and build a bunch of boutique hotels, microbreweries, and artisanal mayonnaise shops to appease the masses,” said Layla of Queens . “RIP Queens, you were good while you lasted.” “We enjoy fairly reasonable rents (compared to Brooklyn and Manhattan), we have small businesses that are practical and usable (butchers, bakeries, fish mongers) and there’s not an artisanal mayonnaise shop or gluten free anything in the bunch,” said Zazie of New York . “We love living in Queens and would gladly leave it untouched as a ‘destination.’” But a few influential Queens business people said they welcomed the influx of tourists. The founder of Sweetleaf, a Long Island City cafe mentioned in the article, wrote in to express his excitement that Parisian tourists, among others, had heard of his store. “There is so much more food, art, cultures to be explored. We are the world’s greatest melting pot!” said Alfred Arundel of Costa Rica and Queens . Image Journalists from Mexico were among the tourists who visited the Socrates Sculpture Garden in Queens last month. Credit Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times Ellen Kodadek of Queens, said , “While Times Square may be known as the Crossroads of the World, Queens has become the Crossroads of our City!” Ms. Kodadek is the executive and artistic director of Flushing Town Hall, a Queens performing arts center. Tourists themselves chimed in with praise. “I visit Queens for a week every year — for the US Open. And although most of my time is spent watching tennis, we love to visit Jackson Heights, Flushing, and other neighborhoods. We stay out in Bayside and are welcomed every year by the waitress at the Italian restaurant on Bell Blvd; when we walk into the Vietnamese place for a late dinner, the owner gets up and switches the TV to tennis for us. He recognizes us, too. Not to mention the friendly and helpful bus drivers. Not an Onion parody at all. Queens is real,” said jw of Boston . Mr. B from Buffalo said , “Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria. Fantastic! And the Beer Garden around the corner.” “Can’t believe you fail to mention Rockaway Beach, an absolute jewel,” said Seano from Pennsylvania .” Well, not all tourists had praise. Porter of Sarasota, Fla., said: “This is truly beyond all understanding. Yes, some stretches of coast are appealing, but overall Queens is dirty, gritty, unkempt, and seriously in need of investment on its roads, bridges and in its public parks and spaces. And a good sand-blasting for most of its buildings. Visit it on vacation? You’re out of your mind.” Undaunted, Queens residents who did not mind giving away their secrets wrote in with their own travel advice for visitors. “If you’d like a little wilderness mixed into your urban vacation, try the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. If you want a little beach time, visit the revamped Rockaways,” said Ecce Homo of Queens , who also plugged the culinary delights of his neighborhood, Jackson Heights. “Food critics have long recognized Queens as the home to truly excellent restaurants of all descriptions … The chefs tend to be recent immigrants, so the food is the real thing.” “Oh, and our hotels/motels are mostly more affordable and much more parkable than Manhattan offerings,” said Carol Goldstein of New York . “Most are near subway lines that will get you into Manhattan in no more time than it takes to go from midtown to the Battery.” “And don’t forget the Queens Farm Museum, the aviary at the zoo, the botanical garden,” said Anthony N. of New York . “Ride the 7 train and see the world,” Larry ULURP of New York wrote, apparently testing a new tourism slogan that many Queens natives hope never catches on.",

    "source": "Running Out of Time in Greece <eos> LONDON — As interest rates on Greek debt spiral upward again, the question facing Europe is no longer whether Athens has the political will to cut spending and raise taxes to curb its gaping budget deficit, but whether Greece will run out of money before it gets the chance to do so. With the rate on 10-year Greek bonds reaching as high as 7.5 percent on Thursday, up from 6.5 just three days ago, the cost of insuring against a Greek default hit a record high. The message from the market could not be clearer: artfully worded communiqués from Brussels will no longer suffice. To avoid bankruptcy, analysts said, Greece needs a bailout from Europe, and fast. “This is no longer about liquidity; it’s a solvency issue,” said Stephen Jen, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who is now a strategist at BlueGold Capital Management in London. But with European officials consumed with a debate over whether loans to Greece should be offered at rates consistent with a typical I.M.F. bailout or punitive ones closer to current market levels, the risk is that while Brussels fiddles, Greece is burning. At a press conference on Thursday, Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, sought to break the fever in the markets by saying that the aid program proposed by the International Monetary Fund and the European Union was a “very, very serious commitment.” The statement helped bring yields on 10-year Greek government bonds down from their peak for the day, to 7.35 percent, but it was not enough to turn around the mood of pessimism that contributed to a further fall in Greek and other European stocks. “Time is running out,” said a senior official in the Greek government who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue. “The market is testing Europe’s resolve.” To a large extent, this latest bout of Euro-stasis is a function of Germany’s view that it is not the market contagion from the Greek drama that presents the greatest risk to Europe. Instead, Berlin is far more worried, as Mr. Jen puts it, about the supposed “contagion of bad behavior” in other countries like Portugal and Spain that might follow if Greece were to become the beneficiary of a bailout on relatively generous terms. “This should be easy to do; Greece is only 3 percent of Europe’s G.D.P.,” said Paul De Grauwe, an economist based in Brussels who advises the president of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso. “But this is no longer a financial issue. It is about politics and nationalism, and it is a real setback for those who believed in a united Europe.” There are unmistakable signs that individuals and corporations are withdrawing funds from Greek banks, although the sums involved do not yet constitute a bank run. Still, weakened Greek banks, increasingly shut out of the capital markets, have become largely dependent on the European Central Bank and have turned to the Greek government to release more money from a previously established rescue fund. The Greek government is coming close to giving up on private investors as well. While Athens said it would go ahead with its short-term borrowing auctions this week, the planned fund-raising trip this month by Greece’s finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, to tap Wall Street investors is unlikely to happen as long as Greek borrowing costs remain high, said a person who was briefed on his plans. Greece’s hope is that it will be able to borrow as much as 30 billion euros ($40 billion) from Europe and the I.M.F. at a rate of about 4 percent or so, which is consistent with the terms offered by the fund to other indebted countries. Such a view, however, assumes that the I.M.F. would be the lead actor in the rescue, as it was in countries like Hungary and Latvia that are not in the euro zone. In all the vagueness of the European Union’s agreement with the I.M.F. on Greece, the one point of clarity was that Brussels rather than the I.M.F. should dictate terms, even if a team of I.M.F. experts was already in Athens advising the government. As a result, European officials, pressed hard on this point by Germany, are now saying that Greece must not receive the carrot of concessional interest rates available to those who agree to accept the stick of an I.M.F.-style austerity package. Greece’s interest payments on its net debt, as a percentage of its gross domestic product, are already the highest among developed nations, according to recent research by Deutsche Bank. And as the economy withers further in the face of spending cuts and tax increases, its ability to generate the revenue to pay these sums decreases. “If you look at Greece’s G.D.P. potential and its borrowing costs,” Mr. Jen said, “there is a gigantic gap.” The sharp rise in rates has spurred increased talk of some form a debt restructuring. In such a situation, analysts said, holders of Greek debt could perhaps be forced to accept a loss of 20 percent or more on their bonds. That would be similar to what happened after Argentina defaulted on $93 billion in debt in 2001. Like Argentina, Greece has suffered from a fixed currency, fiscal deficits and a growing lack of industrial competitiveness. Still it seems unlikely that Europe — which through German and French banks owns over 100 billion euros in Greek bonds — could countenance such a solution. “If you do a restructuring, people would not lend any further money to Greece,” said Yannis Stournaras, an economist and an adviser to previous Socialist governments. “That would be a huge mistake,” he added. “Greece has the mechanism. It just has to ask for the money.”",

    "source": "George Steinmetz’s Aerial Photography of New York <eos> New York has stories it doesn’t reveal to the people walking its surfaces; you have to get up high to see them. This is where the photographer George Steinmetz works: in a lightweight one-person paraglider, in a tiny two-person helicopter, sometimes on a high floor in a tall building. In his 30 years of taking aerial photographs, Mr. Steinmetz, 58, has aimed his camera at animal migrations in sub-Saharan Africa and the sculpted sands of the world’s deserts. More recently, he has plied the airspace above the city. You see things up there, he said. You see a rooftop pool designed with an Andy Warhol filmstrip — “Who knew there were all these swimming pools?” he said — or townhouse blocks in Brooklyn that could be toy sets as interpreted by early Modernist painters. One morning, flying around the Frank Gehry-designed building at 8 Spruce Street in downtown Manhattan, Mr. Steinmetz’s camera captured a man wandering naked through his apartment. “You see lives inside very expensive pigeonholes in the sky,” he said. These days the city skies are getting crowded — not just with new skyscrapers but also with drones , whose numbers are likely to multiply on the morning of Dec. 25. “Drones are revolutionizing aerial photography,” Mr. Steinmetz said. “They’re doing what the iPhone did for still photography, putting it within everyone’s grasp.” The catch for Mr. Steinmetz is that it is currently against the law to take drone photographs for commercial purposes. “So my son can use my drone to take all the pictures he wants,” he said, “but if I do it, it’s illegal.” The images here are collected in a new book, “New York Air” (Abrams), and are part of an exhibition at Anastasia Photo on the Lower East Side through Jan. 31. The gallery prints tell yet another story about the city. The dots become people. “You really have to see the big prints,” Mr. Steinmetz said. “When they’re small, you see the patterns. Up close you see the people and the life in the city.”",

    "source": "In Struggles of Artist With His Work, Hints of Mexico’s Own <eos> MEXICO CITY — DAMIÁN ORTEGA’S completed installation outside the new Museo Jumex here looks, at first, like a workaday kitchen filmed in space. A teapot, plates, bowls and utensils slowly spin above an unassuming wooden table. A chair, then another, seem to be balancing on one leg. Gradually, deeper meanings emerge. First, complexity lies below. The piece includes five concentric circles of floor, each spinning slowly. Second, Mr. Ortega’s domesticity is a quiet rebuke to its surroundings, lying between Mexico’s newest icons of wealth: the billionaire Carlos Slim Helú’s shimmering new Soumaya Museum and the Jumex, the new home for the widely admired art collection of Eugenio López Alonso, the Jumex juice heir. Mr. Ortega’s piece, in short, is a rebellious interloper, a playful whirligig combining simplicity, beauty and a surprisingly anticorporate message. “It’s a monument to everyday life,” Mr. Ortega said. “I thought it would be interesting to have a public plaza with something intimate and individual.” Mr. Ortega is certainly not the first Mexican artist to be concerned with class or the quotidian, but his interest in re-examination — in taking old things apart and putting them back together in new ways — makes him well matched to the moment. Mexico is in the middle of a perception crisis. Optimists who insist the country should be portrayed as rapidly modernizing are constantly arguing with those who see a society stuck in place, with metastasizing violence, continuing corruption and poverty that may or may not be receding, depending on the data set. In the midst of this confusion (compounded by a lack of government transparency), Mr. Ortega’s art seems to offer a comforting sense of agency and connection. Even before his piece was finished, people walking by touched its familiar items. “People want it to move,” said Rosario Nadal, the curator who oversaw the commission for the piece. “They go up to the table and move things around.” Mr. Ortega, 45, with longish hair and a voice that moves quickly from soft to firm, welcomed the interactivity. The son of an actor and a teacher at an alternative school housed in a former stable, Mr. Ortega came to art through play. He fondly recalls a boyhood shaped by seeing his father practice comedic roles in front of the mirror, putting on mustaches or wigs, and hanging around set designers for movies and theater. Mr. Ortega said he was also strongly influenced by watching the area where he grew up — Tlalpan, on the southern edge of Mexico City — go from mostly rural to densely urban. There was little planning or forethought, he said, just lots of activity. “Mexico is a country that’s very productive,” he said. “There is a lot of making and fixing things. It’s a very rich culture of resolving things and finding solutions to problems, alternative solutions.” That turned out to be exactly what Mr. Ortega needed for “Cosmologia Doméstica,” his piece outside the Museo Jumex. It was his first installation with a large international team: Designers in Europe drew computerized markups of the complicated mechanism that would move the floor, with Mexican construction firms assigned to build and assemble it. Mr. Ortega and two art coordinators he met a decade ago at the Venice Biennale would supervise. BUT putting it all together turned out to be far harder than expected. Despite promises of precise measurement from Mexican producers, the metal rings meant to turn the floor were not perfect circles; they would move a bit, then get stuck, like a warped bicycle tire caught by the brakes. Video The Times’s Damien Cave tracks the delayed debut of Damián Ortega’s modern art installation outside the new Museo Jumex in Mexico City. Then the teams meant to construct the piece kept delaying. With just a few days before art collectors from all over the world were to arrive for the Museo Jumex opening in November, Mr. Ortega’s piece looked like an open maw full of steel, wood and workers. Wearing a plaid shirt and trying to sound upbeat five days before the official debut, Mr. Ortega described it as a culture clash between rigidity and flexibility. The steel gears below the floor represented European engineering, but when combined with improvisational Mexican production, movement proved to be a challenge, he said. Mr. Ortega bent down with some of the workers and tried to explain his vision of a floating system of motion, with some larger gears allowed to move back and forth within the flawed circle. It did not work. A day later, he tried ropes and pulleys. That failed, too. Then he and his team went even simpler, with rubber wheels spinning the larger metal rings. This seemed to succeed, but only after what would become a major overhaul: The circles would have to be cut and welded again to make them round enough for easy movement. Each new day produced minimal progress. It was a race of stress and physics, and a reminder that art does not spring from the mind fully formed and ready for Sotheby’s. Contemporary art today, much of it at least, is less effete than industrial, a battle of calloused hands and computers fighting the limits of resistant materials, in a mad search for beauty or provocation. When he was in a good mood, Mr. Ortega compared the process to a Mexican carnival, with the grizzled mechanics who make the rides go despite rust, bent steel and lost screws. In darker moments, he compared his experience to the famed disaster of filming “Apocalypse Now .” Or constructing a crypt. “I’m like the last slave building a tomb,” he said the night before the official opening, drilling long after dark. “I’m going to be here all night. Definitely.” AND he was. The following morning, as foreign visitors sipped Champagne and toured the museum with curators and the building’s architect, David Chipperfield, work continued on Mr. Ortega’s piece. He had missed the deadline and the elaborate parties, losing out on a chance to hobnob with the global art elite and old friends like the artist Gabriel Orozco, with whom he had shared a studio roughly a decade ago as they both sought greater acclaim. It was frustrating, he said, depressing. Unintentionally, though, he had also become a monument to the routine of most Mexican workers: long days, little guarantee of a clear payoff. “With him, it’s like going back to the original,” said Grazia Cattaneo, 43, an art coordinator from Italy whom Mr. Ortega hired to help oversee construction. “He is always trying for simple solutions that work. He has a very poetic vision.” Museum officials stood by him as well. Patrick Charpenel, the director of the Museo Jumex, insisted that the museum would always be “committed to following local artists.” “We stick with them,” he added. “It’s a beautiful piece.” And eventually, he was right. Two months — yes, months — after the official opening, Mr. Ortega’s installation was finally finished. With everything orbiting as planned, it was understated on the surface, with deep complications down below. Mr. Ortega resisted describing the piece as a metaphor for Mexico, but at a second opening the museum held on his behalf on Feb. 3, he said he was relieved and thrilled to see the piece completed. Asked what kind of project he planned to take on next, he did not hesitate: “A painting,” he said. “A very small painting.”",

    "source": "New Florida Rules Return More Than 115,000 Ex-Offenders to Voting Rolls <eos> MIAMI — Gov. Charlie Crist announced on Tuesday that 115,232 Florida felons had regained their voting rights since new rules took effect last April, but 80 percent of the state’s disenfranchised ex-offenders remain off the rolls. The governor — a Republican who had initially pushed for a broader clemency program — said he was proud of the progress and hoped the number of those regaining voting rights would increase. “Once somebody has truly paid their debt to society, we should recognize it, and we should honor it and we should welcome them back into society and give them that second chance,” Mr. Crist told a crowd of law enforcement officials and advocates for prisoners’ rights in Tallahassee. “That could make an enormous difference in November,” he said. Indeed, the new figures arrive during a hotly contested presidential race — and as Florida has come under increased scrutiny for erecting barriers to voting. Since 2000, Florida has passed some of the strictest voter registration rules in the country. It is also the most populous of three states (the others are Kentucky and Virginia) whose constitutions require withdrawal of voting rights from all felons. So while ex-inmates in 47 states typically have their civil rights restored automatically, in Florida until April, most felons who finished prison and probation had to endure a lengthy review by state officials. About 7,000 each year were cleared to vote, to serve on juries and to get jobs that require state licenses, like a nurse or barber. The newer rules create a three-tiered system for ex-convicts, based on the severity of their crimes. Those who have completed sentences and probation for the least violent, Level 1 offenses since April can have their rights restored without having to fill out paperwork, after the state confirms payment of restitution. Of the 115,232 who have regained their rights, the vast majority are older cases that preceded the law. But most of the state’s estimated 950,000 felons must request reinstatement. It is not clear how many more people are eligible. “There is a large demand for this,” said Muslima Lewis, director of the voting rights project at the American Civil Liberties Union in Florida. “And it is a lot higher this year with the election.” Ms. Lewis said Mr. Crist deserved credit for changing the rules. But, she said: “It does need to be seen in context. There is a lot more that needs to be done.” The issue of voting rights here has long been intertwined with race. The ban on voting by felons became part of the state Constitution in 1868, when many Southern states found ways to suppress black votes in the wake of the Civil War. More recently, liberal groups have accused the state’s Republican-controlled government of retaining the policy in an effort to keep blacks, who tend to vote Democratic, from registering. Some Republicans have argued that felons of all races forfeit their rights when they commit crimes. Mr. Crist, in turn, has emphasized the Christian value of redemption. And yet, for those who are looking to have their rights restored, voting is just part of the appeal. Gregory L. James was released from jail in March after serving 12 years on a federal drug conspiracy conviction. A talkative 46-year-old who founded a nonprofit organization that mentors former prisoners, Mr. James said he hoped to have his rights restored over the next few years. He sees it as a way to finally move beyond prison. “Being whole again means that I have my rights again,” Mr. James said. “Without my rights, it’s like I’m still doing time all over again.”",

    "source": "Mets’ Bolstered Rotation Is Again in Doubt <eos> PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — The Mets decided years ago to build their team around elite young pitching, a strategy that carried some inherent risk. Strong and vibrant pitchers are lost to arm injuries every year , so general managers almost have to walk around with their fingers crossed, hoping for the best. The Mets are no exception. They essentially passed on the 2014 season when Matt Harvey sat out after Tommy John surgery. This year, his comeback is the biggest story of their spring training, but three other pitchers have injuries that will cause Mets fans to hold their breath. Zack Wheeler, whom the Mets consider nearly as important as Harvey, will miss his next start because of elbow tenderness and a blister on his index finger. Josh Edgin, the team’s top left-handed reliever, is considering Tommy John surgery. Vic Black, one of the team’s top setup men, is having his right shoulder examined. The Mets announced the news about Wheeler on Friday, and General Manager Sandy Alderson insisted that the injury was not serious. He said that Wheeler experienced the same thing at times last season, managed the problem, then had it examined over the off-season. The Mets seemed satisfied with the results, because Wheeler started the spring with no public restrictions. Alderson pointed out that Wheeler was spectacular in the second half of the 2014 season. Over his last 15 starts, he compiled a 2.80 E.R.A. and averaged more than a strikeout an inning. His fastball was among the fastest in the National League. “We don’t think it’s serious because it’s something that he’s experienced before,” Alderson said. “It’s sort of an intermittent issue that he has to manage. At this point, we don’t expect it’s going to be a major issue.” Alderson expected Wheeler to miss just one start. Black was sent Friday to have a magnetic resonance imaging test on his right shoulder. But Alderson did not seem too concerned about him, either, calling the test precautionary. Alderson indicated that the problem was tendinitis. Edgin’s injury appeared to be the most serious. The Mets previously said he had a stretched elbow ligament and was given a choice: Have Tommy John surgery and miss the season, or try to rehabilitate the injury. Before Edgin decides, he will get a second opinion from Dr. James Andrews, an orthopedic surgeon.",

    "source": "Courting a Crowning Moment in Prague <eos> After more than 10 nomadic months, Tomas Berdych’s A.T.P. Tour season ended last week in London and the weary Czech, eliminated from the World Tour Finals after a loss to Novak Djokovic, was asked to share his best moment of the year. “I hope that the best moment is still to come,” Berdych said with a grin. Berdych, for all his fearsome ability to pound a tennis ball into submission, has yet to win a Grand Slam singles title and may never do so in the age of Roger Federer, Djokovic, et al. But Berdych still has a chance to achieve closure this year by winning the Davis Cup with the Czech Republic. Berdych and his longtime teammate and doubles partner, Radek Stepanek, have been on essentially a two-man quest since 2007. And, after losing to Rafael Nadal and Spain in the final on indoor clay in 2009 in Barcelona, they now get the chance to play the final at home against Spain without Nadal in the equation on a much (much) quicker indoor hardcourt. Hopes are understandably high even if David Ferrer, who is playing this week for Spain, has won just as many tournaments this year on indoor hardcourts (two) as the more powerful Berdych. It has been 32 years since Czechoslovakia won its first and only Davis Cup title and even though the Czechs and Slovaks split amicably in 1993, it is difficult not to see the Davis Cup final this week through the lens of that 1980 final, which was also staged in Prague. The Czechs kept Czechoslovakia’s place in the elite 16-team World Group after the country’s division, while the Slovaks had to start again in the event’s minor leagues and work their way back up, which they did quite impressively, reaching the 2005 final, which they lost to Croatia. But while the Slovaks have had their stars, including Miloslav Mecir and, more recently, Dominik Hrbaty, Karol Kucera and Daniela Hantuchova, it is the Czechs who have provided the bulk of the champions through the years. The women include Martina Navratilova, Helena Sukova, Hana Mandlikova , Jana Novotna and the potential masterwork in progress, Petra Kvitova. The men include Jaroslav Drobny, Jan Kodes and Ivan Lendl. Lendl and Kodes were on the 1980 team that defeated Italy, 4-1, in Prague, but the Czechs were, like Berdych and Stepanek, essentially a two-man band, with Lendl and Tomas Smid the only Czechs to play in the final. Lendl was just 20 then, not yet the obsessively rigorous player who would rise to world No.1 and win eight Grand Slam singles titles. But he and Smid squeezed the suspense out of the final, with Smid beating Adriano Panatta in five sets, Lendl beating Corrado Barazzutti in four and then the two Czechs clinching the victory by beating Panatta and Paolo Bertolucci in five sets in doubles. Lendl later said that winning the final was not as big a highlight for him as his victories on the road in the semifinal over the Argentine stars Guillermo Vilas and José Luis Clerc. But the final was definitely the bigger highlight for his country, which he later left — like Navratilova — for exile in the United States. Czechoslovakia was the first Communist country to win the Davis Cup since the competition began in 1900. But capitalism and the naming rights that accompany it are now firmly entrenched and this final will take place in the O2 Arena, with a capacity of 13,800, which sold out on the same day that tickets were released to the general public in October. That is a reflection of the passion the Cup can still generate as the Czechs and Spaniards prepare to play the 100th final in the event’s history. But the Cup final has also become more a local than a global occasion, with interest often building to a peak in the two finalist nations but with less resonance in the wider world. More star power would not hurt, but it is not as if the game’s biggest draws have not taken their swings at the title. In 2010, Djokovic led Serbia to victory, using it as a springboard to winning three Grand Slam singles titles and finishing No.1 in 2011. Nadal has been part of four Cup-winning efforts for Spain, including the victory last year over Argentina in Seville. Although Federer is uncertain to play the Cup next year, he had every hope of finally winning it this year, but he and the Swiss were upset in the first round by John Isner, Mardy Fish and the Americans in Switzerland. This final still has heft. Ferrer and Berdych are both ranked in the top six. Spain’s second singles player, Nicolas Almagro, is 11th. The doubles rubber is expected to match Spain’s Marc López and Marcel Granollers, who won the title at the World Tour Finals, against Berdych and Stepanek, who have a remarkable 11-1 record in Davis Cup together. Their only loss came against Spain in the 2009 final, when Feliciano López and Fernando Verdasco beat them in straight sets. The Spanish, with Ferrer and Nadal in the singles, went on to sweep that final 5-0. But a rout looks unlikely this time around. Berdych might play his most persuasive tennis on fast surfaces: See his run to the final on the slick, blue clay in Madrid this year. But Spain has the deeper team even without Nadal and its new captain, the former leading player Alex Corretja, has ably managed the tricky task of following on the work of his friend Albert Costa, who won two titles in his three-year run as captain. “The year has been very good but we want it to be excellent,” Corretja said. “Nobody on this team is satisfied with the possibility of losing. We will give it our all.” Corretja and Costa were on the team that won Spain the Cup for the first time, in 2000. The Spanish have since been the competition’s dominant force, winning again in 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2011. Berdych, Stepanek and the Czechs would be delighted to do it just once.",

The lawyer, Carey W. Gabay, 43, was shot in the head during a predawn celebration in the Crown Heights neighborhood before the West Indian American Day Parade. A friend of the family said he remained in critical condition on Thursday morning. Mr. Gabay was a bystander caught in a shootout that is believed to have been between gangs, the police said. He was taken to Kings County Hospital Center , where he has been in a coma. His family and friends have been keeping vigil at the hospital since Monday. The man sought for questioning has been described as a black man, 19 or 20 years old, who was wearing a white T-shirt and black pants, and had a Jamaican flag around his neck. The officials have not specified whether the man is suspected of being the gunman or a witness. Image Mr. Gabay Credit Judy Sanders/Office of the New York Governor, via Associated Press The New York Police Department has also offered a $12,500 reward for information leading to the arrest and indictment of the gunman. Mr. Gabay, the son of Jamaican immigrants, grew up in the Boston Secor Houses , a public-housing project in the Bronx, and graduated at the top of his class at Truman High School . He studied government at Harvard, where he was elected president of the undergraduate council, the main body of student government, in his senior year. Later, he attended Harvard Law School.

    "source": "Racing to See Banksy Graffiti, While It Can Still Be Seen <eos> Ilyssa Fuchs, a lawyer whose office is just below City Hall, logged onto Facebook at lunchtime on Tuesday and immediately bolted from her desk. She asked two other lawyers in her suite if they were interested in joining her on a six-tenths-of-a-mile dash, and not to get to some emergency hearing in court. “I said, ‘You like art?’ “ she explained. “They said no. I said, ‘You like graffiti?’ They said not really. To be fair, they are prepping for a trial. So I said, ‘I’m running up there,’ and my heart was going the whole time. Was it still there?” “It” was a silhouette of the twin towers looming over the Lower Manhattan landscape, with a burnt-orange chrysanthemum dangling where one of the hijacked jets struck on 9/11. And it was apparently the latest work by the elusive British street artist Banksy, who is halfway through a monthlong “residency” in New York. It may or may not be one of his more provocative installations, but it drew a crowd alerted by a photo on Instagram , then a post from his Twitter account: “Time to step it up.” He did not elaborate. He rarely does. He is famously anonymous, putting up his distinctively playful stencils unnoticed, and there was no response on Tuesday to an e-mail to a London publicist who represents him. He did not even say exactly where the twin towers silhouette was, but others soon pinpointed the location, again on Instagram and Twitter. That made things easy for Jane Viera, a publicist from Los Angeles who is on vacation in Manhattan. “They said ‘Jay and Staple,’ and we were like, ‘We’re there,’ ” she said, referring to the location of the silhouette, on the Staple Street side of the building at 9 Jay Street, about half a mile from where the World Trade Center stood. Some in the crowd discussed blog posts about other Banksy works that have appeared in recent days. They wondered how long this one would last before being tagged over, or damaged. They said they had heard stories of locals who commandeered a site, covering the Banksy and making visitors pay to see it . That did not happen at midday on Staple Street. The crowd took photos of the twin towers silhouette, some with cellphones, some with digital cameras. Some trained their eyes on others in the crowd — and up, at the windows of surrounding buildings — because they figured Banksy was somewhere nearby. They said true artists attend their own shows. Oscar Salguero, who designs children’s products, wondered whether the flower was Banksy’s, or had been put there by someone else. Either way, he said, the flower “looks like flames.” “But the connotation is so different, it’s beautiful,” he said. His Web site said he set up a table in Central Park last Saturday and sold signed canvases for $60 apiece , far less than they would otherwise sell for. A sign on the table advertised the work simply as, “Spray art.” The buyers, if they knew Banksy’s work, apparently did not realize they had bought originals, not knockoffs. But he did not part with many. The Web site said his total for the day was $420. “I’m amazed at the publicity this guy gets,” said Robert Janz, who said that he had painted several images on the Staple Street wall before the Banksy silhouette appeared. (“I am not a graffiti artist,” Mr. Janz said. “I draw on top of graffiti.” He pointed to a buffalo he had painted inside someone else’s graffiti.) As for whether he admired Banksy, Mr. Janz said, “I admire him for putting up a piece right under one of mine.”",

    "source": "That Must Be Bob. I Hear His New Hip Squeaking. <eos> The first time John L. Johnson’s artificial hip squeaked, he was bending down to pick up a pine cone in his yard in Thomasville, Ga. Mr. Johnson looked up, expecting to find an animal nearby. Susan O’Toole, a nutritionist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, who first squeaked going up stairs after getting home from her hip-replacement surgery in 2005, said she thought the banister she was gripping needed repair. And Edward Heary, an apprentice appraiser in Hatboro, Pa., said clients sometimes look with embarrassment or concern at their floorboards when he walks though their homes. As all three patients — and hundreds of others — discovered once they pinpointed the source of the noises, they had become guinea pigs in an unfolding medical mystery. Their artificial hips are made of ceramic materials that were promoted as being much more durable than older models. But for reasons not yet fully understood, their hips started to squeak, raising questions about whether the noises herald more serious malfunctions. “There is something amiss here,” said Dr. Douglas E. Padgett, chief of adult reconstructive and joint replacement service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. More than 250,000 Americans get total hip implants each year, a procedure that generally costs close to $45,000. Hip replacements have a success rate of more than 90 percent, based on patients’ achieving relatively pain-free mobility after recovery periods that range from a few months to a year. Any artificial hip can occasionally make a variety of noises. But until Stryker, a medical products company, began marketing highly durable ceramic hips in the United States in 2003, squeaking was extremely rare. Now, tens of thousands of ceramic hips later — from Stryker and other makers that entered the field — many patients say their squeaking hips are interfering with daily life. One study in the Journal of Arthroplasty found that 10 patients of 143 who received ceramic hips from 2003 to 2005, or 7 percent, developed squeaking. Meanwhile, no squeaks occurred among a control group of 48 patients who received hips made of metal and plastic. “It can interrupt sex when my wife starts laughing,” said one man, who discussed the matter on the condition that he not be named. Beyond annoyance and embarrassment, many patients and their surgeons fear that the squeaky ceramic hips may signal that the joints are wearing out prematurely. That could force patients to undergo the very operation — a second replacement of the same hip joint — they had hoped to avoid by choosing ceramics. Already, dozens of patients have elected to endure subsequent surgeries to replace the noisy hips. Some have sued Stryker, the pioneer and market leader, which some doctors say has been slow to take their patients’ concerns seriously. Last fall, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to Stryker, saying it had failed to take the steps needed to prevent squeaking and other problems. Clouding things further, Stryker last year recalled ceramic hip parts made at its factory in Cork, Ireland, after determining that some did not meet its sterility specifications. Stryker says that none of the problems underlying the recall or the warning letter from the F.D.A. reflect problems that cause squeaking, which it contends occurs in less than 1 percent of implants. Whatever the actual frequency, some investigators who have looked at the problem say the squeaking seems to be associated with extreme flexing of the ceramic implants, but exactly how is unclear. In X-rays, many of the squeaking hips appear to be perfectly aligned. Nor is there a clear relationship between squeaking and hip pain or other conditions some patients say they have encountered, like the sensation that the hip disengages slightly when a patient walks. Some patients squeak even they are walking normally, like Ms. O’Toole or Michael Mueller, a software executive in Scottsdale, Ariz. Mr. Mueller is so frustrated with squeaks, pain and popping noises for which he blames his ceramic hip that he has displayed his problem on YouTube. While there have been no reported cases of serious mishaps, some surgeons fear that the ceramic material might shatter at some point, leaving a patient with so many inflammatory shards in the hip that a doctor could never find them all. “Catastrophic failure has been a concern in the past, with older ceramic components,” said Dr. James M. Bried, a surgeon in Poway, Calif. Ceramic materials have been used since the 1960s. Dr. Bried, who implanted Mr. Mueller’s hip last year, said he was concerned that squeaking might be “a harbinger of something similar.” Mr. Mueller said Dr. Bried had told him to consider getting the hip replaced “sooner rather than later.” Stryker says such fears are overblown. “It is important to keep this in perspective,” said Aaron R. Kwittken, a spokesman for Stryker. “Published research shows squeaking is rare compared with other total-hip-related risks like infection, dislocation and leaving patients with uneven leg length.” But plaintiffs lawyers, who have already filed scores of lawsuits on behalf of ceramic hip patients, are gearing up to argue that squeaking is not a minor problem for many who experience it. “We’re in the infancy of this,” said Douglass A. Kreis, a personal injury lawyer in Pensacola, Fla., whose clients include Ms. O’Toole and Mr. Johnson, who has had his ceramic hip replaced. Most artificial hips, whatever material they are made of, share a basic design: a socket implanted in the pelvis, into which a spherical head is fitted. The head is attached to a spike that is driven into the femur, or thigh bone, to anchor it. Durability is paramount with artificial hips. Patients worry that they will outlive their artificial hips and require a second, more extensive and even more expensive procedure at an age when their bodies may be less able to cope with the trauma. Ceramic hips were promoted as lasting much longer than the 15 years or so for conventional artificial joints made of steel and plastic. Now that the squeaking has raised caution flags, researchers are weighing the noted durability of ceramic-on-ceramic hip joints like Stryker’s Trident model against products with other combinations of materials. Each combination has known or suspected drawbacks. Metal-on-metal devices, for instance, slowly shed tiny ionized particles that some researchers say might promote cancer . And even the newest plastics are still not as durable as other materials, raising the risks of fragments that can lead to bone-destroying inflammations. For patients who have already received ceramic hips that have started to squeak, many orthopedic surgeons advise nothing more than watchful waiting unless there are also signs that the hip is slipping out of place or that ceramic particles are breaking loose from the head or the socket. Doctors who have removed ceramic hips say they find dark stripes that indicate accelerated wear on the ceramic heads. But durability tests have suggested that even those extracted hips would have outlasted conventional metal-and-plastic replacement joints, according to researchers. “There is no evidence that the wear associated with squeaking would lead systems to fail,” said Dr. James A. D’Antonio, an orthopedic surgeon outside Pittsburgh, who was a chief investigator on the clinical trials that led to regulatory approval for Stryker’s Trident. Dr. D’Antonio, whose longstanding role in Stryker’s product development efforts earned him $1.1 million in consulting payments from the company last year, said he had implanted 400 Tridents since the clinical trials began in 1996. He said that only four of his patients had noticed squeaks and that none of them were able to reproduce them in his office. But Dr. Fabio Orozco, a surgeon at the Rothman Institute, a major orthopedics group in Philadelphia, said that a recently completed review of about 1,500 Rothman patients with ceramic hips had found that the squeaking condition occurred in 49 of them, or about 3 percent. “I’m very hesitant to use ceramic-on-ceramic now,” Dr. Orozco said, “unless we are talking about somebody very young.”",

    "source": "Migrants in Kos Inspire Both Hospitality and Anger in Greeks <eos> KOS, Greece — Dawn was breaking over a beach near Kos harbor, and the first swimmers threaded their way between orange beach umbrellas into the sea. Suddenly, a black rubber dinghy burst out of the grayness. It tacked rapidly toward the beach, and the life-jacketed young men on board began ululating with joy. Migrants, they had made it across the narrow stretch of water from Turkey to the Greek island of Kos, and what they hope will be a safer and more prosperous life in the European Union . One punctured the boat. Most of the others scrabbled onto the sand, dropped their life jackets and quickly vanished into the nearby alleyways. Two young friends, Shady Khilel and Akram Dakdk, both 21, stopped for just a moment to take a selfie. In their Bermuda shorts and T-shirts, with beards and tousled hair, they could have passed for tourists. Only Mr. Khilel’s scratched and swollen feet hinted that they had had to hike through thorny underbrush on the other side of the channel to get to their boat. After taking the photo, Mr. Khilel made three phone calls. “Allahu akbar,” he crowed to the first person. “Mama,” he explained, laughing joyfully. The next call was to his best friend. The third was to a friend in Kos, who had made the same journey by boat from the Bodrum peninsula in Turkey a few days earlier — Ayman Almotlak, a teacher of Arabic. Mr. Almotlak instructed the two young men to meet him at a cafe near the medieval fortress, less than a mile from where they had washed up. Image One migrant helping another shave early Thursday on the island of Kos, Greece, as they wait to be registered at a police station. Credit Alexander Zemlianichenko/Associated Press At the cafe, another friend, Nour Hamad, a veterinarian, explained why they had made the journey. “We lost everything in Syria ,” Mr. Hamad said. Mr. Khilel said something, and Mr. Almotlak translated: “My friend says he lost his humanity.” On Wednesday, five days after he reached the beach, Mr. Khilel sent a reporter two photographs and a brief voice message. It said, “I am in Macedonia.” His timing may have been lucky. On Thursday, Macedonia declared a state of emergency and said it was tightening security on its normally porous border with Greece, stranding thousands of migrants who are trying to move north to more prosperous European countries. Traveling With Dignity On Kos, the clean white tables and chairs of a seaside cafe overlook a small yachting marina, and a few miles away across the blue Aegean waters, the whitewashed houses of Bodrum can be seen sparkling in the sun. In between are a new addition to the scene this summer: the tents, clotheslines and playing children belonging to thousands of refugees who have fled destitution and war. A group of elderly Greek men in crisp shirts sipping coffee at the cafe could be overheard saying that the Greeks, too, were once refugees. “But we always traveled with dignity,” one added. Dignity, or axioprepeia in Greek, is the word of the hour in Greece. The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, frequently used it as a battle cry against the austerity demands of eurozone creditors. But it seems to have a special resonance here, where the promise and the reality of modern Europe meet. Salvage Operations A peculiar industry has sprung up on the island: salvaging the migrant boats. Every morning, a small group of enterprising Greek men cruise the beaches in jeeps, picking up the punctured dinghies, the abandoned motors, the discarded inner tubes and life jackets. Video Over 1,000 migrants mainly fleeing the Syrian war are being held in the area as the police try to contain the influx of people arriving. Credit Credit Ognen Teofilovski/Reuters One of them is Grigoris, 72, who rides barefoot across the beaches at 5 a.m. in his open jeep. He specializes in life jackets, and every morning he collects a pile of them, as hundreds more migrants arrive in Kos. The jackets generally do not meet European Union standards, so they cannot be legally reused in Greece, he said; instead, he removes the foam from them and turns them into reflective vests, which he sells or gives away. “I do this just to keep busy,” Grigoris said. “Anything illegal, I like.” In his youth he was an itinerant acrobat, he says, traveling as far as Brazil to perform. Now his bare feet are hard enough to walk on glass, he says. He lives on the produce he grows in his garden, while collecting antiques, and now life jackets. He is proud of his cunning. “People like me, we are not educated,” he said. “But we are more intelligent than many educated people.” Common Ground Dealing with the onslaught of migrants has forced the Greeks, who could be excused for being consumed with their own country’s never-ending economic crisis , into a strange kind of double-think. On the one hand, their fundamental hospitality comes out, and they want to help. On the other, they see the flood of migrants as detrimental to tourism and their own economic interests. In public they express compassion; in private, they are very often angry and resentful. In this resentment, Turks and Greeks, enemies for centuries, find common ground. In Bodrum on the Turkish side of the channel, a tour guide and a restaurant waiter ask a visitor whether Kos is overrun with migrants. Yes, they are told, the influx already exceeds 20 percent of the island’s population of about 33,000. That is nothing, the Turks reply. Turkey has nearly two million refugees on its hands just from the Syrian civil war, more than any other country. Priority for Syrians Last Friday, three days after a near riot in a stadium on Kos where migrants were being held , a giant ferry that once cruised between Athens and Crete docked at the island. The ferry was pressed into service as a floating processing center, dormitory and refectory. The hope is that it will take some of the migrants off the streets and beaches of Kos, where they have been camping out while waiting for papers that would allow them to move legally inside Greece . The Global Refugee Crisis, Region by Region In the latest crisis, tens of thousands are racing to Hungary before a border fence is finished. Mayor George Kiritsis of Kos announced that Syrian migrants would be given first priority. Syrians receive preferential treatment in many ways, because the Greeks consider them most likely to be actual war refugees rather than economic migrants. Migrants were told to assemble at midnight Saturday to board the boat. Several hundred men, women and children milled anxiously at the dock. A man brought a feverish baby to the Coast Guard officers providing security for the ferry, and was told to take the child to a hospital instead. The Syrians in the crowd began complaining that many of those assembled at the boat were not Syrian. “Passports!” the Greek authorities demanded, in English. When most of the crowd did not seem to understand, they called for refugees who understood English and Arabic to step forward and translate for the rest. Christian Salloum, a Syrian in a new blue and white souvenir Kos cap, volunteered. Mr. Salloum, who said he had worked as a journalist before fleeing Syria, organized the waiting Syrians into two lines, one for those who had already registered with the authorities and the other for those who had not. A group of men suddenly started jumping up and down, chanting and clapping in protest that they were not being allowed onto the ferry. “They are saying, ‘We are Iraqis,’ ” Mr. Salloum explained. The disturbance passed, and the Syrians began boarding the ship. Asked about his hat, Mr. Salloum said he had gotten it to remember Kos. “It’s a nice place, but we don’t have the heart to enjoy it,” he said. “For us, it’s a road. I hope someday to come here not being a refugee.”",

    "source": "Clijsters and Federer Win First-Round U.S. Open Matches <eos> Kim Clijsters , once the world’s No. 1 player, does not favor the word comeback to describe her return to professional tennis after a two-year absence. She considers what she is doing now as tackling a second career, mixing tennis with motherhood to create for herself a fresh start in a sport that once wore her down with injuries. Roger Federer , the men’s No. 1 player, has mixed in fatherhood without missing a practice session. He laughs at the idea that this year is any sort of comeback because in 2008 he fell all the way — gasp — to No. 2. Clijsters and Federer brought their vastly different experiences to Arthur Ashe Stadium on Monday but had similarly easy first-round matches at the United States Open. Clijsters looked rejuvenated in a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Viktoriya Kutuzova of Ukraine, and Federer only barely ruffled in a 6-1, 6-3, 7-5 victory over the 18-year-old American Devin Britton. “It was a good start to the tournament for me,” Federer said. “It was a tricky match for me, playing a guy who’s got absolutely nothing to lose. I’m here as a five-time defending champion.” But as Federer rolls into what must feel like home at the National Tennis Center, where he has not lost a match since 2003, Clijsters came in trying to unravel the mystery of how she will do after a two-year absence. She retired in 2007, nagged by chronic injuries and the desire to start a family with her husband, Brian Lynch. Now that their daughter, Jada, is 18 months old, Clijsters decided a few months ago it was time for another try. Federer arrived here coming off victories in the last two Grand Slam events, the French Open and Wimbledon, and with new twin daughters in tow. They were born in late July, with his wife, Mirka, doing the hard part and Federer playing the support role. He talks glowingly about combining fatherhood with his career, which did not miss a beat. Britton took a service game off Federer in the second and third sets, but Federer broke back immediately both times and turned the challenge into something only a little more than a nuisance. The last time Federer was beaten in the Open was by David Nalbandian in a fourth-round match in 2003. Britton was unlikely to be the next one to do it. He won the N.C.A.A. singles title in the spring as an unseeded freshman at the University of Mississippi. He signed a pro contract this summer. “My goal was not to get crushed, and make it interesting for a little while out there,” Britton said. “It was fun for a little while.” Now 26, Clijsters, who is from Belgium, has many supporters here, and Open officials were eager to give her a wild card. She was the 2005 champion, a well-liked personality in a women’s game that has been wanting for more of those since she stepped away. And she gives the tournament a comeback story to follow, whether she considers it one or not. “Little more nervous than usual,” Clijsters said. “It’s a very special court to me, but I really enjoyed it. I felt really good out there.” Her match was the first of the day, and of the tournament, and Clijsters was greeted by a crowd of 2,000 or so when she stepped onto the court into swirling breezes. The crowd grew as she dominated the match, which took 58 minutes, as did her confidence. She said the experience brought back a flood of good memories of her “first” career here, where she won her only Grand Slam title. “Obviously, the situation was a lot different then, but you kind of get the whole feeling for it again,” Clijsters said. “I remember just driving up here this morning, just seeing the court and everything. The same memories come back. But it’s nice. I mean, I’m glad that I have those memories.” Clijsters beat four top-20 players in the two tournaments she entered this summer, and her two losses came to No. 1 Dinara Safina and to No. 4 Jelena Jankovic. Because she is a wild card, she is unseeded. Up next is 14th-seeded Marion Bartoli of France, whom Clijsters beat in straight sets in the first round of the Cincinnati Open in early August. Perhaps the most entertaining match of the day came in Louis Armstrong Stadium when John Isner outlasted Victor Hanescu of Romania, the No. 28 seed, 6-1, 7-6 (14), 7-6 (5). Isner, a big-serving American, made a splash here two years ago when he was just out of college, advancing to the third round and taking a set from Federer with the Ashe Stadium crowd cheering wildly for him. This match was nowhere near that magnitude, but was a challenge for Isner nonetheless. He is bouncing back from a bout with mononucleosis. He was taxed by the 30-point tie breaker but fought off 10 set points by Hanescu to win it on an excellent serve-and-volley play. Serena Williams, the No. 2 seed, made quick work of her first-round match against her fellow American Alexa Glatch in a 6-4, 6-1 victory on the Ashe Stadium court. The men’s No. 12 seed, Robin Soderling of Sweden, a French Open finalist this year, needed four sets to beat Albert Montañés of Spain, 6-1, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. The No. 8 seed, Nikolay Davydenko of Russia, won, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5, over Dieter Kindlmann of Germany.",

    "source": "Politics Seen in Cuban Accusations of Military Plot by Miami Men <eos> MIAMI — There was a time not all that long ago that Santiago Alvarez, a Miami developer, fantasized about swinging an automatic weapon over his shoulder and heading back to Cuba to incite an uprising. His criminal record shows he did a bit more than daydream. A 30-month federal prison stint for illegally possessing a cache of weapons behind him, the 72-year-old Mr. Alvarez is among a small group of older Cuban exile activists who the Castro government believes are still plotting its demise. He and six other Miami men were accused by Cuban officials Wednesday of plotting a violent attack on military installations in Cuba with the hopes of toppling the Communist government. Mr. Alvarez denies any involvement in the alleged plot. Some others here raised questions about how much the case is about crime and how much is about politics. Four of the men are in custody in Havana in connection with an episode that to Mr. Alvarez and others has the feel of something more from the past than the present. “I wish I could get a rifle and fight the dictatorship, but that is not realistic,” he said on Thursday. “We cannot live in the past.” Fifty-five years after Fidel Castro won an armed rebellion of his own and a week after Washington again kept Cuba on its short list of state sponsors of terrorism , the Cuban government publicly announced that violent plots persist. Cuba-watchers said the case was hard to separate from political theater, particularly because the announcement came on the heels of a visit by four members of Congress to see Alan Gross, an American imprisoned for illegally taking satellite gear to Cuba. With his case on the diplomatic forefront and Cuba still pushing for the release of three Cuban agents jailed in the United States, experts say Havana is likely to use the latest arrests for its diplomatic benefit. Although Miami was long the birthplace of conspiracies to overthrow the Castros, experts say most aging exiles have embraced nonviolent avenues toward democracy. “I just don’t see it,” said Andy S. Gomez, a Cuba expert, who retired last year from the University of Miami and who voiced skepticism about the charges. “There are some old-timers that believe the only way to topple the regime is by doing these activities, but over the years those numbers have decreased to really nothing.” A statement from the Interior Ministry published in the Communist Party newspaper Granma on Wednesday said that on April 26 four Miami residents “of Cuban origin” were arrested on terrorism-related charges. The men, whom the statement identified as José Ortega Amador, Obdulio Rodríguez González, Raibel Pacheco Santos and Félix Monzón Álvarez, reportedly admitted that they had planned to attack military installations and “promote violent actions.” The men sought to break into a military unit and kill soldiers and officers, according to Juventud Rebelde, another state-run newspaper. “Toward this end, three of the individuals had made several trips to the island, since mid-2013, to study and practice the execution of their plans,” the statement from the Interior Ministry said. The suspects in custody said Santiago Alvarez and two other men in their 70s had helped hatch the plan, the government statement reported. Also implicated were Dr. Manuel Alzugaray, an orthopedist who runs an international medical humanitarian organization in Miami, and Osvaldo Mitat, Mr. Alvarez’s co-defendant in a 2006 weapons-possession case . “Osvaldo and I meet every once and a while and drink coffee, but there has been no conspiracy going on between us for years,” Mr. Alvarez said, adding that he had never met the men arrested in Havana. “Some people are saying these guys are infiltrators. To me, these people are real. I think they either got misguided or wrong advice or they came up with the wrong idea.” Little is known about the men who were arrested. Florida corporate records show that in 2009, Mr. Pacheco, 31, founded an organization called the Cuban Liberation Force. “The purpose of this corporation, under the Human Rights Act, is to help the people in Cuba to reconquer their democracy and lost liberties,” the founders wrote by hand in the state records. Attempts to reach their families were unsuccessful. The State Department declined to comment. “I don’t know these people,” Dr. Alzugaray said. “The Cuban government writes something in a controlled Communist fashion, and it resonates around the world. They have done tremendous propaganda here.” Dr. Alzugaray is the founder of the Miami Medical Team, an organization that provides medical assistance internationally. In the 1980s, the group went to Nicaragua to help those wounded fighting the leftist Sandinista government. The Cuban government has accused Mr. Alvarez of terrorist activities before. Mr. Alvarez is known as a benefactor of Luis Posada Carriles, a former C.I.A. operative linked to both the downing of a Venezuelan airliner and a string of hotel bombings in Havana in the 1990s. Mr. Posada was arrested in Panama 14 years ago on allegations that he planned to assassinate Fidel Castro at a presidential summit meeting, and the Cuban government said at the time that Mr. Alvarez was a mastermind of the operation. The Cuban government later released recordings of him talking to an informant discussing placing a bomb in the famed Tropicana nightclub. In 2005, federal agents raided an apartment of his and found five machine guns and a grenade launcher. Mr. Alvarez said the weapons were C.I.A. relics, but were not going to be used in the plots he had hatched with senior Cuban military officers who planned to conspire against the government.",

    "source": "With Bartolo Colon and R.A. Dickey, Braves Look to Contend Now <eos> ATLANTA — R. A. Dickey chuckled at the idea of not being the Atlanta Braves’ oldest starting pitcher next season. Dickey, 42, must concede that distinction to Bartolo Colon, 43. “I gave myself the nickname ‘Little Ugly,’” Dickey said Friday, playing off Colon’s nickname. “Big Sexy and Little Ugly are going to be leading it on.” Colon and Dickey recently agreed to one-year contracts, each with a team option for 2018. The Braves insist their unorthodox moves show how serious they are about contending again for a postseason spot. The major target of their rebuilding plan was the starting rotation. That’s where Colon and Dickey come in, giving the Braves two players who can eat up innings and mentor younger pitchers without requiring the sort of long-term commitment that might block the path of several top prospects. “These aren’t four- or five-year deals,” General Manager John Coppolella said. “These won’t, theoretically, block any of our kids. It will just give them a little more time. Guys that may have been force-fed up here now have a little more time to get their sea legs under them as they turn into really good big-league pitchers.” In a way, the signings of Dickey and Colon show that the Braves’ timetable for a return to contention has been pushed up a bit. The acceleration in the approach coincides neatly with a move from Turner Field to SunTrust Park, a $622 million suburban stadium nearing completion that will anchor a complex of shops, restaurants, office space, residential areas and a hotel. Dickey was introduced at a news conference in an eighth-floor suite that provided an ideal view of SunTrust Park and the furious construction activity going on below. This is a franchise that has undergone a major overhaul, on and off the field. “It’s a real honor for me to be a part of a very storied franchise that looks like it’s on its way to becoming what it once was,” Dickey said. “I’m happy to be a part of that growth and hoping that I can add to what they did at the end of the year.” Despite a second straight year of more than 90 losses, Atlanta finished strong, indicating that better times may not be far off. A trade for the slugger Matt Kemp and the emergence of players such as Dansby Swanson, Ender Inciarte and Adonis Garcia helped the Braves win 50 of their last 97 games, and they closed the season with a 12-2 spurt. “Our starting eight is really good,” Manager Brian Snitker said. “Everybody feels very confident in what we’ve got going on, and rightly so.” The Braves are still in talks to add another pitcher, perhaps even a top-of-the-rotation starter such as Chris Sale of the Chicago White Sox. But for now, Colon and Dickey provide an aging insurance policy. Colon is coming off an All-Star season with the Mets. He had a record of 15-8 with a 3.43 earned-run average and became the oldest player to hit his first career homer. Dickey, with a 10-15 record and a 4.46 E.R.A., is more of a gamble. He slumped down the stretch with the Toronto Blue Jays and was dropped from the starting rotation. “We didn’t give up any players,” Coppolella said. “It didn’t cost us a draft pick. We’ve been in trade talks for players — pitcher and nonpitchers — but the price of doing business is really expensive right now. So for us to be able to add somebody where it’s only money is really important.”",

    "source": "Rumors, Merger Talk and Denial by Airlines <eos> Long-simmering talk of an inevitable round of airline industry mergers heated up again yesterday. By the end of the day, after a spike in their share prices, the central players in any merger talks, dismissed the rumors as just that. Many airline executives have said they are in favor of consolidation, in theory, to help reduce costs and improve historically meager profits. And they were given a push by Pardus Capital Management — a New York hedge fund that holds big stakes in UAL, parent of United Airlines, and in Delta Air Lines — which sent Delta a letter Tuesday night suggesting that the two carriers merge soon. “We believe it is imperative that you seek to enter into a merger transaction,” Karim Samii, president of Pardus, wrote to Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta. The topic line of the letter said: “Time is of the essence to announce a transaction with UAL.” Pardus hopes that a merger of the second- and third-largest airlines would capture more business travelers and help the carriers navigate the fuel prices that threaten to snuff out the industry’s nascent recovery. Delta promptly responded that it was, indeed, in favor of industry consolidation, but that it was not involved in merger discussions with United. Delta said the airline’s board had previously appointed a special committee to evaluate, among other strategic options, merger possibilities and that it had retained financial and legal advisers. Thus, after the companies’ shares briefly rallied when an Associated Press report said United and Delta had actually been discussing a combination — a report subsequently denied by both companies — the shares showed only modest gains yesterday. Shares of Delta rose 77 cents, to $19.77. Shares of United rose 67 cents, to $44.17. Both companies are valued at approximately $5 billion. A stock-for-stock deal, with no premium, as Pardus proposed, would create a company with a roughly $10 billion market capitalization, depending on investors’ reaction to the combination. Although most executives acknowledge the need for mergers to reduce costs, the reality of doing so gives them pause. The industry has a long history of difficult mergers. The most recent example is US Airways, the product of a merger two years ago with America West Airlines. There, pilots are battling over how to reconcile union seniority lists, a sticking point that is holding up the company’s ability to operate as a single airline. Combining computer systems has led to severe service disruptions. Shares of US Airways have plunged from their 12-month high of $63.27, reached around the time it made an unsuccessful $10 billion bid for Delta a year ago, to $23.48 late yesterday. Workers at Delta and United would most likely be skittish about any combination that reduced employment or job security, having just made huge pay and benefit concessions to survive separate bankruptcies. To be sure, since the initial US Airways bid for Delta a year ago, big airlines have had tentative discussions with one another about merging. Delta talked to Northwest Airlines at one point. United talked to Continental Airlines. But nothing concrete came of those talks. Pardus said in its letter that it owns 7 million Delta shares, or about 2.6 percent. And Securities and Exchange Commission filings indicate it owns 5.6 million shares in UAL, or about 4.8 percent. The industry has been modestly profitable last year and this year and was building a cash cushion until fuel prices soared in recent weeks. Pardus said in its letter that the rise in fuel costs could hurt Delta’s financial prospects next year. Airlines are trying to raise fares to make up for the higher cost of fuel, which accounts for about one-third of expenses, but with only limited success. Pardus said in its letter that it had consulted with Gordon M. Bethune, a former chief executive of Continental Airlines, and with consultants at Simat, Helliesen & Eichner to conclude that United was the best merger partner for Delta. Combined costs could be reduced by $585 million a year, it said. And the airlines’ complementary strengths would give it the breadth to capture more business travelers. United, after all, has a big presence on Asia routes, in the western United States and at Heathrow Airport, serving London. Delta is strong in the southern United States, at Kennedy International Airport in New York and in Europe and Latin America. A combination of Delta and Northwest Airlines would allow more cost-cutting — $1.5 billion a year because of enormous overlap in domestic hubs — but provide less international breadth, Pardus said. The US Airways takeover proposal for Delta was also mostly aimed at reducing domestic costs and ran into opposition from labor groups and from some politicians, fearful that service would have been reduced in some cities. Pardus mentioned that “the current regulatory environment,” meaning the Bush administration as opposed to a possible Democratic president, is favorable and thus a merger ought to happen soon.",

    "source": "Extended Benefits Are a Lifeline for Many Unemployed <eos> HUDSON, Fla. — Rick E. Rockwell plopped his large frame down in front of his laptop on Thursday morning, next to a foot-wide sheaf of unpaid bills still in their envelopes, lined up like an accordion on his desk. He logged into his bank account to see if his unemployment check had been deposited yet. His balance, however, remained stuck at $57.17. “That’s amazing to me,” Mr. Rockwell said. “It still hasn’t posted yet.” So Mr. Rockwell began another day as a man of the middle class who is now living on an economic precipice. Mr. Rockwell, 56, who estimates he has sent out more than 400 job applications over the last year and gone to just four interviews, is one of the more than 5.4 million people across the country receiving unemployment benefits. And Mr. Rockwell is part of arguably the hardest-luck group of all — those who have been out of work for so long that they are depending on a second emergency extension of unemployment insurance that Congress passed and President Bush signed last month. In the 21 states and the District of Columbia currently with three-month average unemployment rates above 6 percent that means 20 more weeks of what has become an economic lifeline for many in the midst of one of the deepest recessions in the past century. Florida ’s rate for November was 7.3 percent. (The other states get seven additional weeks.) For Mr. Rockwell, who lost his job in January as a sales manager at a computer store that he and his brother owned, the weekly checks of $275 — the maximum allowed him under Florida law and a little less than half his former take-home pay — have become like a crucial piece in the game Jenga, in which players construct a tower of blocks by removing one at a time from the bottom and moving it to the top. Mr. Rockwell is playing a balancing act so he can keep the edifice of his former life from crumbling, paying off certain bills and letting others lapse, so he can stay just ahead of his creditors. Mr. Rockwell has been without benefits for more than a month after he exhausted the first federal extension, which lasted 13 weeks, on top of the 26 weeks he had received from the State of Florida, back in October. After supporters were unable to get the legislation through Congress before the election, Mr. Bush signed the second extension in late November. Florida, like other states, has been rushing to get checks to so-called gap people like Mr. Rockwell whose benefits had expired. Advocates estimate there are about 800,000 of them nationwide. “States are really overwhelmed in terms of responding to claims,” said Andrew Stettner of the National Employment Law Project. “They were pushed beyond the brink in terms of doing the second extension.” Florida added 50 staff members to its unemployment insurance division in recent weeks, bringing its total to around 870. It also recently added 345 lines to its phone system for a total of just over 1,000, and has extended its call-in hours. There are, of course, people who are much worse off than Mr. Rockwell; but there are also many who have had much more of a financial cushion to get through this crisis. Last year, he was making $31,200 a year as sales manager of a small computer store that he had started 15 years ago with his brother, Rodney. But the rise of big-box stores like Best Buy, along with the recession, combined to drive their store, Comp-U-Save, into the ground. “All of a sudden, the floor came out from underneath it,” said Rodney Rockwell, who closed his old store in October and re-opened under a new name. The brothers agreed that Rick would leave in January because the store, by that point, was depending mostly on its repair business, which was Rodney’s specialty. They also figured that because Rick was younger and had some background managing restaurants, he would be able to find a job relatively easily. He had a little over $5,000 in his bank account, mostly what was left over from a $40,000 second mortgage he took out on his home four years ago for home repairs that never materialized. But Mr. Rockwell has been succumbing to a slow economic death, which accelerated significantly in the last month as his unemployment benefits lapsed. His mortgage lender has begun foreclosure proceedings on his modest two-bedroom home, which he bought in 1998 and still owes $117,000 on. He has begun packing to move into his 84-year-old mother’s two-bedroom condominium nearby. He is in danger of losing his red 2005 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder convertible, a prized possession that he keeps gleaming in his garage, because he is behind in his payments. He has listed for sale both that car and a 1996 Toyota RAV4, which he owns outright and keeps in the driveway, but he is hoping to keep the Spyder. The only reason he can still drive it at all is because his mother, who is mostly living just on Social Security, paid his car insurance for this month. He is two months behind on his electric bill. A partial payment by a local church that he went to recently for help helped him stave off losing his power. His water bill is in arrears as well. Mr. Rockwell was settling into his love seat two weeks ago to watch the teenage drama “One Tree Hill” — an afternoon pleasure he developed while sitting around out of work — when he found his cable had been cut off. Last Wednesday, after returning home from dinner with a reporter, Mr. Rockwell found a note on his door from his neighbor that someone had been looking for him. It turned out to be a collection agency for one of his credit cards. Mr. Rockwell has racked up about $15,000 in bills on various cards, reaching his limit on all but one. In a final indignity, Mr. Rockwell wakes up most mornings flat on his back on the ground because the air mattress he now sleeps on, after his waterbed sprang a leak earlier this year, has a hole in it. Mr. Rockwell now spends most of his days hunched in front of his laptop. He spends several hours going through new job postings in the morning and then devotes himself to several Internet marketing schemes promising riches that he has stumbled upon. Keeping in mind the criticism of those who say expanded unemployment benefits keep people from working, Mr. Rockwell conceded he might appear to be too picky in the jobs he would accept. He has mostly ruled out commuting to Tampa, a much larger city an hour away, because of the distance. He has also tried to confine himself to looking for management-level restaurant jobs. “I’m not going to clean grills, take out the garbage,” Mr. Rockwell said. “I’ve done that before, but I feel I’m beyond that.” His home is overflowing with sports memorabilia — autographed posters, baseballs and cards of every sort that he has collected. He has sold off some but is reluctant to part with others at fire-sale prices. On Thursday, Mr. Rockwell spent several hours plowing through job listings and wound up applying — or re-applying, actually — to just two, one for a restaurant manager at an Arby’s in nearby New Port Richey and one for a shift supervisor job at a Wendy’s in Tampa. He logged into his bank account again the next day and found to his surprise that his unemployment check had finally been deposited. It is a small reprieve for now.",

    "source": "A Digital Library Race, and Playing Catch-Up <eos> AMERICA stood at the forefront of the public library movement in 1731, when Benjamin Franklin founded the Library Company of Philadelphia , our first successful lending library. Looking back on the project decades later, Franklin wrote in his autobiography that the growth of lending libraries had played a role not only in educating but also in democratizing American society. “These Libraries,” he wrote, “have improv’d the general Conversation of the Americans, made the common Tradesmen & Farmers as intelligent as most Gentlemen from other countries, and perhaps have contributed to some degree to the Stand so generally made throughout the Colonies in Defence of their Privileges.” Lending libraries may have been the newfangled democratizing factor of their day. Centuries later, though, the United States finds itself trailing Europe and Japan in creating the modern equivalent: a national digital library that would serve as an electronic repository for the nation’s cultural heritage. In other words, there’s a real digital library divide. In contrast to the United States, the National Library of Norway has been a global early adopter. In 2005, it announced a goal of digitizing its entire collection; by now it has scanned some 170,000 books, 250,000 newspapers, 610,000 hours of radio broadcasts, 200,000 hours of TV and 500,000 photographs. And, last year, the National Library of the Netherlands said it planned to scan all Dutch books, newspapers and periodicals from 1470 onward. The libraries of the nearly 50 member states in the Council of Europe, meanwhile, have banded together in a single search engine, theeuropeanlibrary.org . And the European Commission has sponsored Europeana , a portal for digital copies of art, music film and books held by the cultural institutions of member countries. It currently contains scans of about 15 million artifacts. Until recently, however, many American institutions and academic centers have concentrated on making scans of their own special treasures, or collaborating with one another on themed projects, rather than combining their electronic resources into a single online access point. A national digital library is clearly a bigger challenge for the United States, with its vast and disparate library holdings, than for European countries with smaller populations and land masses. But the Library of Congress was already working on the effort in the 1990s when it created a digital collection called “American Memory”; it contains scans of 16 million books, maps, movies, manuscripts and pieces of music. Even so, the library still has more than 100 million other artifacts that are not yet scanned, says James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress. And even though the American Memory project also carries the name “national digital library,” it is not formally connected, for example, to many of the country’s public libraries. “There’s tremendous local activity and national collaboration around specific topics,” says David S. Ferriero, the archivist of the United States . “But there has been no national coordination of all the wonderful disparate projects around the country.” Some of those individual efforts, however, are now beginning to dovetail. Last month, the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard said it would coordinate a planning program for public and private groups interested in creating a “digital public library of America.” The idea, says Robert Darnton, the director of the Harvard University Library and one of the project’s originators , is to link the electronic resources of participating university libraries and cultural institutions like the Library of Congress and make them accessible through a single portal. The hope is to create “a gigantic digital library that would make the cultural heritage of the country available to everyone,” he says. The project would also widen the audience for the kind of historical out-of-print books, manuscripts, letters, images, films and audio clips that have typically been the province of scholars. Of course, practical matters — like cost, copyright issues and technology — would need to be resolved first. “The crucial question in many ways is, ‘How do you find a common technical infrastructure that yields interoperability for the scholar, the casual inquirer or the K-12 student?’” Dr. Billington says. The idea for an American digital public library was prompted in part by the work of Google. In 2004, the company started a digitization project, Google Books, that has since scanned more than 15 million books. Many of these are out-of-print books lent by institutions like Harvard, Cornell and the University of Michigan. “Google came along and woke everyone up and showed the world what could be done in a short period of time,” says Maura Marx, a fellow at the Berkman Center. People can read out-of-print items at no cost on Google Books, if those works are no longer subject to copyright protection. But if a judge approves a settlement between Google and copyright holders, subscription fees to access scans of out-of-print books still covered by copyright will have to be paid by universities and other institutions. An American digital public library would serve as a nonprofit institutional alternative to Google Books, Professor Darnton says. “There’s a conflict between the raison d’être of Google, which is to make money for its shareholders,” he says, “and libraries whose goal is to make books available to readers.” But such a digital public library would have a better chance of success, he says, if it included out-of-copyright books owned by member libraries that Google had digitized. That is already happening in Europe, where the national libraries of the Netherlands and Austria have signed agreements with Google in which their sites can host digital copies of out-of-copyright books in their own holdings that have been scanned by the company. The libraries also have the right to make those scans available on public educational sites like Europeana. A SPOKESWOMAN for Google says the company would be happy to participate in the proposed American project. “Making the world’s books accessible online is something that requires public and private initiatives,” says Annabella Weisl, a Google Book Search executive in Germany, “and so we welcome new efforts in this direction.” But Jill Cousins, the executive director of Europeana, says that the great American research libraries could do much more than simply increase access to scans of scholarly material. “What’s sort of missing is digitization of the accessible literature,” like the popular novels and biographies readers seek at brick-and-mortar public libraries, she says. A few institutions, like the National Library of Norway, are already venturing into this area, via novel arrangements with copyright holders. “It would be nice to conceive of something bigger that has more to do with the public good than with the academic side of the equation,” Ms. Cousins says.",

    "source": "Geithner, Rescue-Team Veteran, Has Head Start in Seizing Reins <eos> WASHINGTON — For the last year, Timothy F. Geithner has been at the very heart of dealing with the financial crisis , the junior partner with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve. Together, they scrambled to save Bear Stearns, American International Group and Citigroup, while letting Lehman Brothers fail. Now Mr. Geithner, youthful president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and President-elect Barack Obama ’s choice for Treasury secretary, will be thrust from go-between to the head of the table. He will graduate from team player to team captain, steering the new administration’s economic policies and its plan to rescue the financial system. The two-month wait until Mr. Obama takes office could be awkward, so much so that people who know Mr. Geithner say he may step down from the New York Fed within a few weeks. That would give him an early start in developing a stimulus plan , which Mr. Obama’s aides say they are coordinating with Democratic leaders in Congress and hope to pass before the inauguration. Mr. Geithner’s immersion in the critical events of the crisis and his close ties to Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke, both appointees of President Bush, will provide a vital sense of continuity for the rescue effort, Mr. Obama indicated on Monday in Chicago. “Tim will waste no time getting up to speed,” Mr. Obama said in announcing his intention to nominate Mr. Geithner. “He will start his first day on the job with a unique insight into the failures of today’s markets and a clear vision of the steps we must take to revive them.” Experts said Mr. Geithner would have to make a series of difficult decisions, in quick succession, about how to proceed with a rescue effort that has been marked by political tension, reversals and a growing sense of confusion, as Mr. Paulson appears to be hostage to events. And he will have to do this in the vortex of a deepening economic crisis, at home and abroad, that could limit his options. Though Mr. Geithner, 47, cut his teeth in past crises, most overseas, economists who know him say little could have prepared him for the magnitude of responsibility he is assuming. “It’s hard to think of a moment in history where a new Treasury secretary has started in this position,” said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. “It’s a position of incredible responsibility. He really has to reshape the financial system, on the run.” While the weekend rescue of Citigroup calmed the financial markets, Mr. Rogoff described it as merely a “temporizing measure” that would have to be followed by other steps. Indeed, there were reports Monday of a vast new loan-purchase initiative being readied by the Fed and the Treasury. As the rescue plan has mutated from asset purchases to direct injections of capital, Mr. Geithner has worked hard to maintain a public alliance with Mr. Paulson, who on Monday welcomed his nomination and noted that Mr. Geithner had been “critical to designing and implementing” the financial industry’s rescue. But people familiar with his thinking say Mr. Geithner has had significant differences with Mr. Paulson over how the bailout should proceed. Mr. Geithner has expressed support for the idea of modifying large numbers of loans held by subprime borrowers, a move Mr. Paulson has largely avoided. Such modifications would create a psychological lift for the nation, Mr. Geithner has told others, and would help resolve uncertainty in the financial markets by creating support for home prices. Mr. Geithner has also voiced private support for purchasing distressed assets from banks, which was originally the focus of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Mr. Paulson abandoned that strategy this month in favor of direct capital injections into the banks. Asset purchases, Mr. Geithner has told associates, would revive investor confidence in many banks, whereas announcing plans to abandon those purchases introduced more uncertainty, as Citigroup discovered last week. Lobbyists for the financial industry who favor asset purchases are hopeful that Mr. Geithner will move the program back in that direction. The bailout of Citigroup was a positive step, they say, although what the government has agreed to do is absorb most of the losses on $306 billion in home and commercial real estate assets on Citigroup’s balance sheet rather than buying those assets outright. “It’s getting closer to the piece we think is necessary, but it doesn’t quite get us there,” said Timothy Ryan, chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Mr. Ryan, who helped direct the government’s rescue of the savings and loan industry in the 1990s, said Mr. Geithner’s involvement in the current rescue effort would give him an invaluable head start. “He’s one of a core group of government executives who’s been part of every decision,” Mr. Ryan said. Robert S. Nichols, president of the Financial Services Forum, which represents large institutions, said the transition from Mr. Paulson to Mr. Geithner was like “delicate surgery,” adding, “If you have to switch doctors, you don’t want to bring in someone who hasn’t even watched the surgery.” If there is a mystery about Mr. Geithner, industry executives said, it is his views on tax matters. Having spent his career in international economics before becoming a central banker, he has said almost nothing about his views on issues like capital gains taxes and dividends. Whatever substantive change Mr. Geithner makes could well reflect a personal style that is different from Mr. Paulson’s. The current Treasury secretary for decades was a Wall Street deal maker, accustomed to short-term, trigger-quick decisions — and reversals. Some say that accounts for the rescue program’s constant evolution and its stop-and-start tendencies. “Geithner has had a very different upbringing: a much more studious, and sober, professional training,” said a former Treasury official and Wall Street executive who knows both men. Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama’s press secretary, said that the president-elect spoke with Mr. Bernanke on Monday morning and that the Fed chairman asked that Mr. Geithner remain at the New York Fed until he could be replaced, “to ensure a smooth transition.” Mr. Obama agreed, Mr. Gibbs added. Once Mr. Geithner steps down, it is expected that he will join Lawrence H. Summers, the incoming director of the National Economic Council, in drafting the two-year economic stimulus package of spending and tax cuts Mr. Obama has called for. In addition, he will have to organize his Treasury staff, prepare for his Senate confirmation hearing and continue to oversee the rescue effort. Though Mr. Geithner is expected to be easily confirmed by a Democratic-controlled Senate, he will face questions about the bailout effort at his hearing, before the Senate Finance Committee, given unhappiness in both parties about the way that program has been operated. As secretary, Mr. Geithner will have to juggle his oversight of the financial rescue program, the process of enacting and carrying out the economic stimulus package and the development of annual budgets. Given that, people who know both Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers see potential for tension between them, should Mr. Summers, given his proximity to the Oval Office and his aggressive style dominate the internal budget and tax debates.",

    "source": "Like-Minded Russians Visit Occupy Wall Street Inmate at Rikers Island <eos> Most people disappear from the headlines into the gray anonymity of Rikers Island after they are found guilty in state court in Manhattan. But for Cecily McMillan, the 25-year-old Occupy Wall Street organizer convicted on Monday of assaulting a police officer, her incarceration has served only to heighten her profile. As her admirers have taken to Twitter in droves to criticize the judge and the district attorney for their handling of the case, Ms. McMillan has gotten sympathetic treatment on “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart” and friendly coverage from left-leaning media outlets like Democracy Now! , The Guardian, The Nation and The Village Voice. That trend reached a peak on Friday, when two members of Pussy Riot, the Russian protest group that was incarcerated for staging a political performance against President Vladimir V. Putin, trooped out to Rikers Island in the drizzle to visit Ms. McMillan in a show of support. “It was a very bad decision to put her in jail,” said one member, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 24, as she came through the jail’s hurricane fence, which is topped with razor wire, and lit a cigarette. “She’s a professional revolutionary.” Her colleague Maria Alyokhina, 25, urged Justice Ronald A. Zweibel to sentence Ms. McMillan to probation and community service rather than prison. She said a harsh sentence would lead to unflattering comparisons to Russia, where they served 21 months for playing a raucous protest song in Moscow’s main cathedral. “Society must organize to save Cecily because she’s really a hero,” Ms. Alyokhina said. “She is very similar to us. We also did time and went to prison for our beliefs. We see a lot of parallels.” The groundswell of support for Ms. McMillan includes some of the jurors who convicted her in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. On Thursday, a juror who said he spoke for nine members of the panel took the highly unusual step of writing a letter to Justice Zweibel, asking that he show leniency. “We feel that the felony mark on Cecily’s record is punishment enough for this case and that it serves no purpose to Cecily or to society to incarcerate her for any amount of time,” the juror, Charles Woodard, wrote, according to a defense lawyer, Martin R. Stolar. Juries have no say over sentencing in criminal cases. Justice Zweibel could sentence Ms. McMillan, who was convicted of second-degree assault, to as little as a stint of community service or as much as seven years in prison. The judge remanded her to jail after the conviction until a sentencing hearing on May 19. The jury found that Ms. McMillan had deliberately elbowed a police officer, Grantley Bovell, in the face as he led her out of Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan during a protest on St. Patrick’s Day in 2012. That protest had started as a way to mark six months since the founding of Occupy Wall Street. Though she had taken part in many other protests, Ms. McMillan testified that she had not joined in the civil disobedience that night. She had been out drinking beer with a college friend and went to the park only to pick up another acquaintance, she said. She testified that she did not recall hitting the police officer, though she said she did remember throwing her elbow instinctively when she thought someone had grabbed her right breast, which was bruised during the arrest. A grainy videotape from an onlooker appeared to support the officer’s version of events, showing her hitting him in the eye, then running a few steps before he tackled her. Since their release from prison in December, the members of the Russian protest group have started a nonprofit, Zona Prava, whose mission is to improve conditions in Russian prisons. They have also used their status as global symbols of political freedom to promote feminism, gay rights and more transparency in Russian politics. Earlier this week, they met with senators in Washington to discuss what they view as Russian human-rights abuses, including the long incarceration of several protesters arrested during a May 2012 opposition rally in Bolotnaya Square in Moscow. They were contacted by Ms. McMillan’s supporters on Thursday and then agreed to go to Rikers. Ms. Alyokhina and Ms. Tolokonnikova, who were accompanied by Petya Verzilov, a member of their arts collective, said Ms. McMillan had appeared to be upbeat and thriving, though she said she missed her cigarettes. Ms. Tolokonnikova said Ms. McMillan had kept busy organizing other female inmates to write letters on her behalf to the judge. A Russophile, Ms. McMillan impressed her visitors with her knowledge of Soviet history and poetry, discussing the absurdist poet Daniil Kharms. “It’s really incredible to see someone that positive in prison,” said Mr. Verzilov, who served as a translator. Ms. Alyokhina said Ms. McMillan had talked at length about how she now wanted to start a social revolution in America. “She told us about the revolution maybe 20 times,” her visitor said. “It’s really very important to her.”",

I stay home trying to keep an energetic baby entertained and happy while searching job sites hoping that something will stick. We enjoy our times alone — it is our time to unwind, to remember that we love each other outside the smile of our son. On a seasonably spring night, we walked through Union Square Park, just the two of us. Having ravenously stuffed our bellies with seafood from a quaint restaurant nearby, we sat on benches. Our bench was placed among a row of others, housing other couples and singles talking about their lives and also enjoying the serene landscape in the busy city. “I don’t want to sit here for long,” I said, uncomfortably shifting and feeling full. “I want to spend time with you,” he said. Without skipping a beat, I replied with a twinge of sarcasm: “We always spend time together. I see you every day!” He took another breath of his cigarette and exhaled. “I just want to spend time with you.” At that moment he put his arm around me and we sat in silence, taking in the view and separating ourselves from the bustling city around us.

    "source": "Univision Buys a Stake in The Onion to Reach Millennials <eos> The Spanish-language media giant Univision Communications announced Tuesday that it had acquired a large stake in The Onion, the comedy and satirical digital media group, as part of the company’s efforts to extend its digital reach and strengthen its portfolio of comedy outlets. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the transaction was said to be for a 40 percent stake, valued at less than $200 million, according to one person briefed on the deal. “Comedy is playing an expanding role in our culture as a vehicle for audiences to explore, debate and understand the important ideas of our time,” said Isaac Lee, chief news and digital officer of Univision. “It has also proven to be an incredibly engaging format for millennial audiences and is expected to play a key part in the 2016 presidential election process via our robust content offerings in Spanish and English.” Univision’s digital portfolio is undergoing a flurry of changes, part of an effort to build its footprint and reach as diverse a group of millennials as possible. News emerged last month that Univision was in talks with the Walt Disney Company to take full control of their joint venture Fusion, the English-language digital news service and cable channel. In November, Univision named Mr. Lee to a new position with responsibility for overseeing digital functions, leading multicultural efforts and creating a music strategy. He also is chief executive of Fusion. Image The Onion’s home page on Tuesday. At the same time, Univision’s plans for a public offering of stock have been delayed after broader fears about the future of the television business sent the share prices for major media companies on a downward spiral. Univision executives saw The Onion as a complement to Fusion and its other properties, with comedy filling a vital role in culture, political discourse and the discussion of current events, according to the person briefed on the deal. They also saw the deal as helping Univision develop new comedy and satirical offerings in Spanish and English and collaborate with up-and-coming talent. The two groups also could create and distribute new TV programs based on The Onion. The deal gives Univision an immediate expansion of its online presence. In December, Univision’s digital sites attracted 19.5 million unique United States visitors, while Onion sites drew 19.3 million unique United States visitors, according to the media measurement firm comScore. The Onion describes its start — with a wink — as rising from “humble beginnings as a print newspaper in 1765” and now attracting a daily readership of 4.3 trillion as “the single most powerful and influential organization in human history.” The company actually began in 1988 as a weekly publication in Madison, Wis. The Onion Inc. portfolio of sites now includes the satire news publication The Onion; the pop-culture site The A.V. Club; the buzzy ClickHole; a gossip site called StarWipe; and Onion Studios, a digital video network. In a memo to employees, Mike McAvoy, the president and chief executive of Onion Inc., said the deal came after the company had searched for a partner during the last year to help the company grow. He said that after acquiring a “good chunk” of Onion Inc., Univision could acquire the remainder of the company in the future. “As an independent media company, we’ve always been forced to run a tight financial ship, which has made us smart and lean, but not always ready to invest in the great new ideas that we come up with,” Mr. McAvoy said in the memo. “I’m excited to see what we can do with Univision behind us.”",

    "source": "Oddly, Tigers, Yankees and Arizona All Like a 2009 Deal <eos> Max Scherzer was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the first round in 2006. When they traded him after three years, it changed his outlook on his profession. “That’s just the business side of the game,” Scherzer said last month, by his locker in the Detroit Tigers ’ clubhouse. “Trades happen, you never know. Heck, I could get traded next.” Not likely. Scherzer has 14 victories for the Tigers, who are going to the playoffs for the first time in five years. Like the other participants in a three-team, seven-player deal on Dec. 8, 2009, the Tigers would not change a thing. “It doesn’t happen this way that often, but it has worked out well for all clubs, which is good,” said Dave Dombrowski, the Tigers’ president and general manager. “We achieved what we needed to, the Yankees did and so did Arizona.” The Yankees acquired center fielder Curtis Granderson from Detroit. The Diamondbacks acquired two starting pitchers: Edwin Jackson from the Tigers and Ian Kennedy from the Yankees. The Tigers acquired center fielder Austin Jackson and reliever Phil Coke from the Yankees, and Scherzer and reliever Daniel Schlereth from the Diamondbacks. Now all three teams are likely to be in the playoffs, with each player in the deal making an important contribution. Even Edwin Jackson has left his mark; after throwing a no-hitter for Arizona last season, he was traded to the White Sox for Daniel Hudson , who has become a solid No. 2 starter behind Kennedy, the first National League pitcher to 19 victories this season. “It’s extremely unusual,” said Josh Byrnes, the Arizona general manager in 2009. “A couple of years out, all the teams are successful, and each team would not undo the deal.” The Yankees were reshaping their outfield after winning a championship. They moved Brett Gardner to left, replacing Johnny Damon, and aimed for Granderson, who was coming off a down year but was under contractual control through 2013. In Dombrowski, Cashman found another veteran general manager with his sensibilities. “With the new generation of G.M.’s, a lot of them are in the mode of ‘I’ll give nothing but I’ll ask for a lot,’ ” Cashman said. “The guys like Dombrowski, Theo Epstein, Kenny Williams, Kevin Towers, those guys are out there willing to give to get. We give a lot, but it’s in the hopes of getting a lot. The newbies don’t want to deal with the negative publicity.” While Cashman and Dombrowski discussed Granderson, Byrnes was pursuing Edwin Jackson, who was coming off an All-Star season. He was also intrigued by Kennedy, who had spent most of 2009 dealing with an aneurysm under his right armpit but looked sharp in the Arizona Fall League. Byrnes introduced the three-way concept as a way to satisfy all parties. He and Cashman knew the Tigers wanted younger versions of the players they would be trading — and then some. Austin Jackson gave Detroit a younger center fielder than Granderson, and Scherzer a younger starter than Edwin Jackson. Cashman also parted with Coke, a left-hander who could start or relieve, and Byrnes included Schlereth, another lefty, who had been a first-round pick. Because Byrnes was trading Scherzer, too, he needed another young starter in return. So the Yankees gave up Kennedy, a fly-ball pitcher who seemed to be a better fit for the National League West than the American League East. “As much as we liked Scherzer and Schlereth,” Byrnes said, “the notion of getting two starters back was pretty compelling.” Dombrowski tried to pry another left-hander, the Yankees’ Michael Dunn, but Cashman resisted. The general managers met in Cashman’s suite at the winter meetings in Indianapolis and finished the deal without Dunn, who soon went to Atlanta in a deal for Javier Vazquez and Boone Logan. Cashman had reservations about Granderson, who slumped in 2009, hitting just .183 against left-handers and who had no mechanical flaw the Yankees could spot on video. Cashman said he warned his boss, Hal Steinbrenner, that in the worst-case scenario, Granderson would have to sit against lefties, and that he expected Jackson to hit for a higher average. But Granderson had much more power, and Jackson, at the time, had never played in the majors. The hitting coach Kevin Long worked with Granderson, encouraging him to keep both hands on the bat throughout his swing, and Granderson carried over a strong finish to 2010 to emerge as a top candidate for the A.L. Most Valuable Player award. “We didn’t think we were trading for a potential M.V.P.-caliber player,” Cashman said. “We just felt we were trading for one of the best everyday center fielders in the game, and that’s what we got.” Likewise, Byrnes said that as much as he wanted Kennedy, he pictured him fitting into the middle of the Diamondbacks’ rotation, not the front. The Tigers’ haul has not greatly exceeded expectations, but one major concern — Scherzer’s health — has not been an issue, and Jackson has skillfully roamed the vast center field in Detroit while giving the Tigers their only real stolen-base threat. The volume the Tigers received in the deal has helped stock their deepest roster, and their best team, in years. At some point next month, Detroit could face the Yankees, and perhaps, the Diamondbacks, for a close-up look at the deal that worked all around. “You can’t help but notice what those other guys are doing, man,” Austin Jackson said. “Those guys are doing well for the other clubs. It definitely worked out well for everybody.”",

    "source": "Congo’s Death Rate Unchanged Since War Ended <eos> DAKAR, Senegal — Five years after Congo’s catastrophic war officially ended, the rate at which people are dying in the country remains virtually unchanged, according to a new survey, despite the efforts of the world’s largest peacekeeping force, billions of dollars in international aid and a historic election that revived democracy after decades of violence and despotism. The survey, released Tuesday, estimated that 45,000 people continue to die every month, about the same pace as in 2004, when the international push to rebuild the country had scarcely begun. Almost all the deaths come from hunger and disease, signs that the country is still grappling with the aftermath of a war that gutted its infrastructure, forced millions to flee and flattened its economy. In all, more than 5.4 million people have died in Congo since the war began in 1998, according to the most recent survey’s estimate, the latest in a series completed by the International Rescue Committee, an American aid organization. Nearly half of the dead were children younger than 5 years old. Perhaps most alarming, while the death rate has slightly decreased in eastern Congo, the last festering node of conflict, it has actually increased in some parts of central Congo, though the area has not seen combat in several years. The study’s authors and other aid organizations said the focus of aid dollars on the east and neglect of the region by government were the most likely explanations for the changes. These surprising findings demonstrate the depth and complexity of Congo’s continuing crisis, said Richard Brennan, health director for the International Rescue Committee and one of the survey’s authors. “The Congo is still enduring a crisis of huge proportions,” Dr. Brennan said. “Protracted elevations of mortality more than four years after the end of the war demonstrates that recovery from this kind of crisis is itself a protracted process. The international engagement has to be sustained and committed for years to come.” The survey was based on a sample of 14,000 households surveyed in 700 villages and towns across Congo from January 2006 to April 2007. Its authors emphasized that the figures in the report are estimates, based on widely accepted statistical methods for estimating death tolls in disasters, but the cumulative figure for how many have died since the war began has a wide margin of error given the difficulty of the terrain in Congo and the lack of precision in basic demographic information, like the prewar mortality rate or even Congo’s current population. Still, improvements in security since 2004, when the last survey was completed, meant that researchers were able to visit many areas that were off limits last time, and as a result, its authors said, the current survey provides the most complete picture yet of the toll of Congo’s slide into despair. That picture is not encouraging. The mortality rate in Congo is 57 percent higher than the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, the survey found. Particularly hard hit were young children, who are especially susceptible to diseases like malaria , measles , dysentery and typhoid , which can kill when medicine is not available. In one village in North Kivu Province, a hot spot of continued fighting, three women of the 20 households surveyed had lost two children each in the 16 months covered by the survey period, Dr. Brennan said. Less than half a percentage point of the deaths were caused by violence, illustrating how the aftermath of war can be more deadly than combat itself. Much of the emergency aid is focused on the eastern part of the country, where militia battles with Congolese troops have chased nearly half a million people from their homes in the last year. A peace agreement to end that conflict was reached Monday. But the increased mortality in areas outside of the volatile east is particularly worrying because it points to longer-term problems that endure long after the bullets have stopped flying. “Given the nature of this country, the vast differences in terrain, the broken infrastructure, I am not surprised,” said Alan Doss, the newly appointed chief of the United Nations ’ vast peace operation in Congo. “This will take a long time to turn around.” The Congolese government spends just $15 per person each year on health care, according to the World Health Organization , less than half of what is recommended to provide the most basic but lifesaving care, like immunizations, malaria-fighting mosquito nets and hydration salts. “The past two years, we can say the health situation has not improved at all,” said Brice de le Vingne, operations coordinator for the region that includes Congo for the aid group Doctors Without Borders. “The only thing that improved a bit is mobile phone coverage. We now are in contact with more people to know that the situation is not good.” Mortality surveys are crucial tools for aid agencies, United Nations peacekeepers and even historians, but the methods used to compile them have come under attack. For example, a 2006 survey by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health that concluded that 600,000 Iraqi civilians had died since the American invasion — far above the estimates given by the Iraqi government and other sources — was attacked as “not credible” by President Bush and the Pentagon, and criticized by other scientists as well. For the current survey, teams of workers fanned out across Congo, a nation as big as the United States east of the Mississippi, but with rivers instead of roads, canoes and bicycles instead of airplanes and cars. Debarati Guha-Sapir, director of the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, a research institution in Belgium, said that the Congo survey was methodologically sound. Still, extrapolating from clusters of data over an area as vast and with as many unknowns as Congo presents particular problems, she said. “The fact is that you have a high mortality rate in Congo altogether by any standard,” Dr. Guha-Sapir said. “Of which some is the result of conflict, some is governance, some is that no heath services are available in many areas, some is just pure poverty and the horrible legacy of what colonialism and Western greed did to Congo.” A number of variables make the survey results inevitably imprecise, particularly when trying to turn an abstract death rate into a number of actual deaths. The population of Congo, for example, is essentially unknown: the United Nations estimated it to be 56.8 million; the Congolese Ministry of Health says it is 69.9 million. If the United Nations figure is right, for example, the actual number of deaths in the most recent survey period would be 522,000, but if the government figures are right, the figure would be 1.05 million, the study found. The number of deaths attributed to the conflict and its aftermath is based on how many people would be expected to die under normal circumstances. Because Congo’s prewar mortality rate is disputed by different sources, it is also a source of imprecision. According to various United Nations estimates, the prewar rate was below that of sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, but the survey’s authors said they chose to use the higher rate of the continent to be conservative. Still, even the death rate for sub-Saharan Africa could be a problematic baseline, said Dr. Guha-Sapir, because in many countries the most basic kinds of censuses are carried out rarely, and not always with precision. Ultimately, using the most conservative and least conservative assumptions, the data show with 95 percent certainty that 3.5 to 7.8 million people have died since 1998, according to the survey’s authors. An earlier survey by the International Rescue Committee, completed in 2004, was published in 2006 in The Lancet, a British medical journal, but the most recent survey was declined for publication by The Lancet. Other experts said such a rejection did not necessarily undercut the scientific validity of the findings. Dr. Brennan said that despite inevitable imprecision, the data point to a vast crisis. “Is it possible that as few as five million people died?” he said. “It’s much more likely that 5.4 million died. But the exact number isn’t as critical. These data can help us understand the scale of the problem and target our solutions to save lives.”",

    "source": "A Second Day, a Second Massing of Grief for a Lost Firefighter <eos> Amid the somber majesty of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, thousands of firefighters, friends and relatives paid tribute yesterday to Robert Beddia, a 23-year veteran of the New York Fire Department, evoking his professionalism and the simple pleasures in his life, from poker and paddle ball to the many nieces and nephews he doted on. It was the second time in two days that firefighters gathered to mourn a colleague. On Thursday, a funeral was held in Brooklyn for Joseph Graffagnino, 33, who, along with Firefighter Beddia, 53, was assigned to Engine 24 and Ladder 5, based in a firehouse in SoHo. They were among scores of firefighters who helped fight the blaze last Saturday at the former Deutsche Bank building at ground zero. On Thursday, two more firefighters were injured at the building, at 130 Liberty Street, when a worker lost control of a small forklift on the 23rd floor and it plummeted 200 feet to the ground. Yesterday, as the ceremony went on inside the cathedral, outside along Fifth Avenue thousands of firefighters stood in formation, their rows of white and black caps visible for blocks as American flags moved softly in a slight breeze. The handling of the fire in the empty contaminant-ridden tower, which was damaged on 9/11 and was finally being dismantled, has come under scrutiny, as officials investigate the two deaths and the problems the firefighters encountered, chiefly the broken standpipe that left them without enough water. There were expressions of anger yesterday in the eulogies and among onlookers outside, but the service did not let the events of last week’s fire overshadow the memory of Firefighter Beddia’s life. Standing before the flag-draped coffin and framed by the cathedral’s soaring bronze altar canopy, Msgr. John Delendick, a Fire Department chaplain, acknowledged the tensions that have emerged over the logistics at the fire. “There’s been an awful lot of finger-pointing,” he said, and added, “A lot of people have been laying blame all over the place, but I’m not here to talk about that.” He and others, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Gov. Eliot Spitzer, a firefighter and a sister, went on to describe Firefighter Beddia’s contributions to the city and, as the middle of five siblings, to his large family. “He was the senior man,” Monsignor Delendick said of Firefighter Beddia’s role in the firehouse. “Young guys talked about how good of a teacher he was, how he was patient and never got angry at them.” Together, the eulogies portrayed a man who was a fixture in SoHo and Greenwich Village, who was equal parts humble and hip, who knew by heart the interiors of many of the buildings in the neighborhood and who, as a bartender, had presided over Chumley’s, an old and popular Village tavern. Though he was divorced and never had children of his own, Firefighter Beddia was close to his 16 nieces and nephews, teaching some of them how to swim and drive, and others how to play poker. “He always gravitated towards the kids in the family,” Monsignor Delendick said. Mayor Bloomberg called him a “quiet hero” who had turned down offers to recommend him for department honors. “He was a man of few words, but when he spoke, others listened,” he said. An avid golfer and the proud owner of an Alfa Romeo, Firefighter Beddia came across in the eulogies as a man’s man. His friend and colleague, Lt. Raymond O’Hanlon, caused ripples of laughter by describing what he called Firefighter Beddia’s sixth sense: the ability to “spot a beautiful woman 1,000 yards out in a fog at night.” The two would be relaxing outside on the street at night, Lieutenant O’Hanlon recalled, when out of nowhere Firefighter Beddia would say, ‘2 o’clock,’ and I’d look at my watch and say, ‘What are you talking about? It’s 11:30.’ ” Firefighter Beddia would nod toward the approaching woman who, by then, was “at 3:30,” Lieutenant O’Hanlon said. Mr. Bloomberg contributed his own anecdote, relating a story he had been told about the time Firefighter Beddia traveled to Italy and decided to buy a car because it was somehow cheaper than renting one. When he pulled into the airport at the end of the trip, he simply left the car behind, the keys still in the ignition. “He exuded the kind of cool that eludes most of us,” Mr. Bloomberg said. There were solemn moments. Governor Spitzer, whose more formal eulogy quoted from Theodore Roosevelt and Shakespeare, vowed to uncover the “truth about what happened on Aug. 18.” Nicholas Scoppetta, the fire commissioner, promised an “aggressive, comprehensive investigation.” As others did, Mr. Scoppetta spoke about the firehouse’s painful past, which included the loss of three firefighters in 1994 after they became trapped in a burning empty apartment building, and then 11 more fatalities on Sept. 11. “You have paid an astonishingly high price, more than any house should have to bear,” he said. Firefighter Beddia’s sister, Susan Beddia Olson, closed the service with the most personal eulogy of all, calling on one memory after another and bringing many in the congregation to tears. “Dear Bobby,” she began in a soft voice. “Do you remember when you and Jimmy bought me my first nine-inch TV for my bedroom, and it was so cool?” She went on to ask if he remembered taking her to the Jersey Shore, making wine with Uncle Mike, rescuing her in the pool, vacationing with their family in Myrtle Beach, playing badminton in the backyard, teaching her how to drive, going to the Who concert with her when she was 16 and walking her down the aisle at her wedding. Hundreds of firefighters and mourners continued on to Moravian Cemetery in the New Dorp section of Staten Island. There, an honor guard gently carried the mahogany coffin. Not 100 yards from where the mourners were gathered, a light wind rustled a cluster of Mylar balloons atop the grave of Russel Timoshenko, the New York City police officer who was shot last month when he and his partner stopped a suspicious vehicle in Brooklyn. In a show of solidarity with the Beddia family, Officer Timoshenko’s parents had attended Firefighter Beddia’s wake two nights earlier. A Fire Department chaplain read Scripture, and then the assembled firefighters passed by Firefighter Beddia’s grave in formation, pausing to salute in pairs. At the end of the graveside service, each mourner placed a red rose on the coffin. Earlier, at the wake, relatives had put a golf club and a paddle ball racquet in the coffin.",

    "source": "Nur Khan's Party at the Hiro Ballroom <eos> Here’s the funny thing about inviting a nightlife columnist to write about your party: She’s there to write about your party. So when we received a special invitation from a publicist to cover Nur Khan and Harry Josh’s private shindig at Hiro Ballroom in the meatpacking district on Saturday night, the e-mail splashed with the names of interesting guests, we eagerly R.S.V.P.’d. We looked forward to spending a long night interviewing guests like Gisele Bündchen, Tom Brady, Helena Christensen and more. Thanks for coming to cover this celebrity-packed party, organizers told us when we got to the event, a pre-party for the Costume Institute gala on Monday night. Just don’t talk to any celebrities. The celebrities “thought this was a private party,” said Mr. Josh, who organized the event. Revised orders: Talk if you must (We must; funny that, it’s only our job) — just not to anyone too famous. We were very upset. But who better to comfort us than a familiar face? Hi, Leonardo DiCaprio! our correspondent ventured, we’re not allowed to talk to anyone famous! Mr. DiCaprio proceeded to laugh so hard that we were afraid his drink might come out of his nose. We continued bemoaning our fate, conscious suddenly of a publicist who, we feared, was encircling us the way a hyena might a celebrity-bothering impala that he wanted to rip limb from limb. “Have a drink,” Mr. DiCaprio said. We would have preferred a Kevlar vest. “Have fun tonight.” Right. Across the dance floor we spotted a Furby-fluffy coat. Maybe we would buy it tomorrow to console ourselves for failing to do our job. Who is the designer? We couldn’t hear Ashley Olsen’s response over the loud music as she fielded bear hugs (appropriate given her hirsute outfit) from people who either had a pass from the publicists — or a death wish. All this not talking to celebrities, our spirits sagged. Are you going to dance, Mickey Rourke? “Not when I’m this exhausted,” he said, describing the workout he had just had for his new rugby movie. Also, he’s a house music guy, he said amid blasting hip-hop. As we spoke, Mr. DiCaprio waved goodbye to him, and, we think, us. Strong-Arming At a party celebrating National Football League rookies on Wall Street earlier that same night, two arcade games were set up at the two ends of Cipriani, inviting guests like top rookies Nick Fairley, Blaine Gabbert and Mark Ingram to toss minifootballs into holes for points. Though the event was in their honor, when we tried the game (and missed — a lot), our dismal score insulted more than our throwing arm: “Rookie,” flashed across the screen. But the rookies had to be thick-skinned. “I was hazed,” said Felix Jones, the Dallas Cowboys running back. “These guys did me good. I want to get back at the guys who got me.” The rookies were safe. “I’m looking at veterans — but not tonight.” Rima Fakih, Miss U.S.A. 2010, arrived in a bright pink minidress and, of course, her sash. We wondered if she was at the wrong event, since the boyfriend on her arm was Ricky Romero, a Toronto Blue Jay. That’s baseball. “In high school, I tried to start a girls’ football team,” Miss Fakih said. “It didn’t work out very well because none of the girls wanted to play football.” There was a happy ending. “I played with the boys.” Fraternizing Miss Fakih and Mr. Romero seemed similarly out of place the next night at the hall of fame induction ceremony for The Players club, a sort of actors fraternity on Gramercy Park. New stars, like Jimmy Fallon, were being added to the celestial portrait gallery that hangs around the club, many painted by Everett Raymond Kinstler. (Katharine Hepburn, he said, was “difficult.”) “In a couple of minutes, my friend from high school will be here,” said Mr. Kinstler. “Only back then, his name was Anthony Benedetto.” Tony Bennett, who attended Manhattan’s High School of Industrial Art with him, soon arrived. Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, who have been married for 56 years, posed for photos. “Our marriage probably ended 35, 36 times,” Mr. Stiller joked. “But somewhere along the line, we said, ‘This is it.’ We never ran off with anyone — though we wanted to.” We told his wife what he said. “He lives in another reality,” said Ms. Meara, who is currently starring in the play “Love, Loss and What I Wore.” “We’ve been in therapy for 30 years,” she added. And their son, Ben Stiller, is he so devoted? “He lives at home,” Mr. Stiller cracked. “We still give him his allowance.”",

    "source": "A Cold and Flu Risk That’s a Real Eye-Opener <eos> Q. As I commute by train and subway during the cold and flu season, can I cut my risk of infections by breathing through my mouth rather than through my nose? A. Just possibly, but only if you can figure out a way to travel with your eyes closed as well, and if you wash your hands frequently, too . A small but frequently cited 1981 study in the journal Infection and Immunity, published by the American Society for Microbiology, compared the risks of contracting a respiratory infection by way of transferring it to the nose, eye or mouth. The results suggested that the eyes and the nose were equally sensitive to infection, while the mouth was comparatively insensitive. Viruses like the common cold and influenza can take different routes to the next victim. They are spread by sneezes and coughs, which produce medium-size droplets that can be carried though the air to the nose and pharynx of nearby people. Protective masks can help cut off such transfers. The droplets can also land on hands, which can transfer them to sensitive mucus membranes, or on inanimate objects, from which they can be picked up by hands and once again transferred to the membranes of the eyes, nose or mouth. Diligent handwashing and avoidance of touching the target membranes can help head off such transfers. Even smaller and lighter virus-contaminated droplets, called droplet nuclei, can travel by air from room to room and even go around the edges of standard paper masks. They can be inhaled, causing lung infections. A frequently recommended precaution is avoiding crowds of possibly infected people during the cold and flu season. question@nytimes.com",

    "source": "The Writing’s on the Wall. (The Writing’s Off the Wall.) <eos> A FEW minutes into the opening reception for an exhibit on the intersection of design and technology at the Chelsea Art Museum, one of the pieces caught fire. The installation, called “Saws,” accidentally ignited when one of the work’s three chainsaws became caught on a stripped extension cord that dangled over a metal sheet on the floor. Propelled by smoke and dust, the crowd emptied out onto West 22nd Street, where they were met with another curious sight. An oversize tricycle was rounding the corner, weighed down with a video camera, a laptop computer, a digital projector and, attached to its frame with bungee cords, two loudspeakers playing “Doobie Ashtray” by the Houston rapper Devin the Dude. The cyclist was a 30-year-old robotics engineer named James Powderly, who, among other projects, once helped develop a remote-controlled arm for NASA’s Mars rover program. Alongside the cycle walked Evan Roth, a 28-year-old artist whose graduate thesis at Parsons the New School for Design analyzed graffiti tags as a source of mathematical data. In the fall of 2005, the two formed an entity called the Graffiti Research Lab, a nonprofit design studio with the mission of producing tools for urban communication. The cycle is their latest invention, and its appearance in Chelsea was its official New York debut. As Mr. Powderly neared the museum’s entrance, he jumped off the cycle and pointed it toward a bare stretch on a garage door across the street. Mr. Roth pulled a laser pointer from his pocket, and as he moved the laser’s green dot across the wall, a line of what looked like thick, drippy paint lit up its surface, roughly following the motion of his hand. But what seemed like an illegal tag was in fact a projection, an ephemeral splash of digital graffiti that would vanish with a flick of a switch on the cycle’s gas-powered generator. “You want to try?” Mr. Roth asked the growing crowd behind him. He handed the laser pointer to a young woman standing nearby. She nodded, hesitant but curious. The cycle is designed to be an accessible, almost playful simulacrum of street tagging, giving passers-by a whiff of the thrill of posting a message in places they’re not supposed to. It is what its creators call a gateway graffiti experience. The idea is to put the tools for unfiltered, unsanctioned public expression in the hands of those who might otherwise shy away from grabbing a spray can or a paint marker. By night’s end, several dozen people had used the laser to scribble personal messages, squealing with amazement each time the projected beam of light appeared on the wall. The first request to use the bike came a week later from Critical Mass, the bicycle activist group, which wanted to use the device for one of its rides through Brooklyn. On a Friday night in spring, Mr. Powderly found himself pedaling the hulking cycle across the Williamsburg Bridge and onto South Fifth Street, to the Williamsburg park where the biking group starts its monthly ride. Joining the crowd of cyclists, Mr. Powderly followed them as they moved through the honking streets of Brooklyn. In search of a spot to project their graffiti, they settled on the handball courts of McCarren Park in Greenpoint. Mr. Powderly positioned the cycle to face the court’s gray concrete wall. Within a few minutes, someone had drawn a detailed sketch of a bicycle, and another person had traced an outline of an American flag. “These people really get it,” Mr. Powderly said. “It’s not just about getting a message up — there are plenty of ways to do that. This is really about getting a community together.” In the months since, Mr. Powderly and Mr. Roth have used the tricycle to write graffiti for a hip-hop music video and handed it over for a night to an organization that is calling for the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney. They have also gone out with people from the New York graffiti collective All City Crew, several of whose members have been arrested in recent months on charges of criminal trespassing and vandalism. Last Sunday, Mr. Powderly and Mr. Roth took the cycle to the Brooklyn Bridge, where 2esae, a member of All City Crew who is facing trial in the fall, used the laser to write on the base of the bridge for several hours. Many of the cycle’s projecting missions are documented in videos posted on the Graffiti Research Lab Web site. At the end of the video from the Critical Mass ride, a typed message flashes brightly across the screen. “Do you need to say something really big and really loud?” it asks in bold, all-capital letters. “Then borrow my bike.”",

    "source": "Sheldon Silver, Unbowed by Charges, Adjusts to Life After the Speakership <eos> ALBANY — The last five months have not been kind to Sheldon Silver . Arrested in January, indicted in February and forced out as Assembly speaker in between, Mr. Silver has seen his influence in the Capitol wane. Some luxuries have been lost, like the office just off the Assembly floor. He now sits in the chamber, next to a freshman Democrat who was 14 years old when Mr. Silver was first elected to the Assembly. Yet in many ways, Mr. Silver remains a presence unbowed, tackling favored causes and displaying no obvious reluctance about appearing in public at the Capitol or elsewhere. At the Celebrate Israel parade in Manhattan last month, for instance, he marched up Fifth Avenue wearing a blue sash and holding up an Israeli flag. Outside City Hall in March, he voiced support for making the Lunar New Year a school holiday. At an April meeting of a task force he formed to address the issue of school overcrowding, those on hand greeted him with applause. “These are my friends,” Mr. Silver said last week, recalling the warm reception. “I’ve been doing this with them for 30 years. As far as they’re concerned, nothing’s changed.” He is even taking small, principled stands, voting against bills that strike him as unwise — including a proposal to allow dogs within the outdoor dining areas of restaurants. Last week, Mr. Silver mounted a campaign against a move to hold New York’s 2016 presidential primary on a date that falls during Passover , recruiting colleagues to sign a letter to the Democratic National Committee stating their opposition. “I’m here doing my work,” he said. “My constituents elected me to do a job, and I’m going to do that job as long as I’m representing them. And if I wasn’t going to do that job, then I would leave.” Mr. Silver, 71, began the year as the most powerful Democrat in the State Legislature and one of Albany’s “three men in a room.” But after his arrest , his fellow Democrats decided he could no longer continue as the speaker. Mr. Silver stepped down , ending a reign as leader that spanned more than two decades. “He’s no longer a man in power, but in terms of his demeanor, there doesn’t appear to be any major anger or bitterness,” said Assemblyman James F. Brennan, a Brooklyn Democrat. “I’m sure he would rather be speaker, but his demeanor is not a disgruntled, embittered man.” Mr. Silver, who is charged with obtaining illicit payments disguised as legitimate income from working as a lawyer, maintains his innocence and is scheduled to go on trial in November. “I’ve hired lawyers, paid them, and they will do their job,” Mr. Silver said. “They, as I, am pretty convinced I’ll be vindicated at the end of the process. And in the interim, I am doing my job. And if they need me, they call me.” Mr. Silver still must contend with the inevitable stares and snickers when he walks through the Capitol. Like other politicians indicted before him, he has become an Albany punch line: This year, at the annual satire show staged by the Capitol press corps, Michael Jackson’s “Beat It” was given a Silver-themed rewrite (with lyrics including “I’ll plead it, plead it, bet your tuchis I will plead it”). There is also this simple fact of life: Some people, especially politicians loath to be associated with scandal, do not enjoy being in the presence of, or photographed with, a person under federal indictment. Mr. Silver did offer one upside to his exile from leadership: The news media, he said, no longer seeks to scrutinize his every move. “I’m glad not to be in the headlines,” he said. “It’s the one thing I don’t miss.” The awkwardness arising from the charges against him has not driven Mr. Silver to stay out of sight. When the Assembly worked late into the night to approve the state budget, he gamely chatted with reporters at the side of the chamber. He even turned up in the background of photos of Sawyer Fredericks, a winner of NBC’s “The Voice” who was honored by the Assembly this month. “I see him at more receptions during the session as a regular member than he was as speaker,” Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Queens Democrat, said. “He comes to everything.” Mr. Weprin, whose father, Saul, preceded Mr. Silver as speaker, said Mr. Silver had been a useful sounding board for members. “Most people would just say, after being speaker, ‘I’m just going to give up,’” he said. Assemblywoman Rebecca A. Seawright of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the freshman member who sits next to Mr. Silver, said he had helped her find her bearings. “Few know process and procedure better,” she said. “I have many questions and he has much patience.” As speaker, Mr. Silver was notoriously hard to read. As former speaker, that has not changed, including when it comes to his feelings about his diminished position. “I don’t see him going on ‘Oprah’ and talking about it, let’s put it that way,” Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan, a Queens Democrat, said. Mr. Silver has good reason to remain active, especially in his Lower Manhattan district. If convicted, he would lose his seat; if acquitted, he would be up for re-election next year, and face the prospect of a primary challenge. Mr. Silver said he planned to seek another term. Since stepping down as speaker, he has become a member of the Assembly’s Education Committee. He introduced a bill to provide a tax credit to families that pay private school tuition , and fielded questions on the Assembly floor about another bill he sponsored that would require food-inspection violations to be posted on a state website . The Assembly approved the legislation. As speaker, Mr. Silver controlled which bills the Assembly considered, so there was never a question about where he stood on those that came before it. Now, as a rank-and-file member, Mr. Silver must decide how to vote. He has developed a bit of a contrarian streak in a chamber where bills usually pass overwhelmingly. He voted, for instance, against allowing the extension of temporary increases to some local sales tax rates, calling the sales tax regressive. He voted in favor of a constitutional amendment that would allow legislators and other officials convicted on corruption charges to be stripped of their pensions . He abstained from voting on a bill to temporarily extend rent regulations and a housing program that gives tax breaks to developers; he said he did so because the tax-break program figured in the criminal case against him. Of his opposition to the so-called dining with dogs bill , Mr. Silver said he had deferred to the concerns of the city’s health department, but he also cited personal experience. “I have a grandson who’s petrified of dogs,” he explained, while noting that some children are bitten by dogs at young ages and are fearful of them as a result. “To put them in that position of having to confront a dog, even though the dog lies quietly on the floor, I don’t think is appropriate,” he said, suggesting, perhaps, that dogs be restricted to only a portion of outdoor dining areas. In two interviews last week, Mr. Silver seemed more at ease discussing legislative matters than his own circumstances. Asked if he thought he had been treated fairly since his arrest, he responded: “Do I really think so? No. But that’s O.K.” He offered a positive but terse assessment of the performance of his successor, Carl E. Heastie, a Bronx Democrat: “I think he’s done a great job.” Mr. Silver acknowledged that his life was different these days. When he was speaker, he said he was well aware that many of his friends would fade away once he was no longer among the state’s most powerful politicians. “I’ve even said it to Carl,” he said. “You come into this job with 10 friends. Maybe you’ll leave with 11.” “But while you’re in the job,” he continued, “you’ll have 500.”",

    "source": "Vatican Defends Move Toward Sainthood for Wartime Pope <eos> ROME — In an effort to calm growing tensions with Jewish groups, the Vatican said Wednesday that Pope Benedict XVI ’s decision moving the wartime pope Pius XII closer to sainthood was not a “hostile act” against those who believe Pius did not do enough to stop the Holocaust. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, issued a statement saying that the beatification process evaluated the “Christian life” of Pius, who reigned from 1939 to 1958, and not “the historical impact of all his operative decisions.” Moving Pius toward sainthood “is in no way to be read as a hostile act towards the Jewish people, and it is to be hoped that it will not be considered as an obstacle on the path of dialogue between Judaism and the Catholic Church,” Father Lombardi wrote. Benedict confirmed the “heroic virtues” of Pius — along with those of John Paul II — on Saturday, opening the door to beatification once a miracle is attributed to each. A second miracle would be required for sainthood. The move created anger among many Jewish groups, which have argued that Pius did not speak out vocally enough against the Nazis or intervene to save Jews during World War II, and that the Vatican helped many former Nazis escape to South America after World War II. The decision by Benedict — a German who was an unwilling member of the Hitler Youth — to move Pius closer to sainthood was the latest in a series of controversies. It came less than a year after he revoked the excommunication of a schismatic bishop who had denied the scope of the Holocaust, an act that caused the pope and the Vatican to issue a series of extensive clarifications. Benedict also upset many Jews when he did not directly mention the Nazis or Germany during a visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel in May, as John Paul II had done, although Benedict has denounced the Holocaust on many other occasions. Even as the Vatican sought to separate the religious aspects of the beatification process from Pius’s historical record, observers said that Benedict’s decision to move Pius toward sainthood sent a strong message, effectively endorsing his actions. Jewish groups had asked Benedict to delay Pius’s beatification process until the Vatican opened the archives from his papacy to scholarly scrutiny . Father Lombardi said that the Vatican “understood” the request to open the archives, and that the copious number of documents from Pius’s papacy were expected to take several more years to process. Defenders of Pius, who was the Vatican secretary of state in the 1930s, say that his reticence was sound diplomacy, and that speaking out more directly against the Nazis would have caused more deaths in Rome and beyond. Benedict has said that Pius worked “secretly and silently” to save Jews. In his statement, Father Lombardi said that confirming Pius’s “heroic virtues” was not intended “to limit discussion concerning the concrete choices made by Pius XII in the situation in which he lived.” He added that the Vatican hoped the pope’s expected visit to the Rome synagogue next month would reaffirm ties between Judaism and the Roman Catholic Church. After days of tension, Roman Jewish leaders said that the visit was still expected to take place. The legacy of Pius is particularly sensitive for the Jewish community in Rome. More than 1,000 of its members were rounded up in 1943 and deported to Auschwitz. Documents in the Vatican archives indicate that Pius knew of the deportation and did not act to stop it. In a statement, the chief rabbi of Rome, Riccardo Di Segni, said he welcomed the Vatican’s statement. “Certainly the historical evaluation remains open and controversial,” Rabbi Di Segni said. “But the Vatican’s understanding of requests to open all paths to research is significant.”",

    "source": "I.M.F. Planning to Sell Bonds to Finance New Loans <eos> WASHINGTON — Hoping to raise money quickly for a new $500 billion emergency loan program, the International Monetary Fund is in the advanced stages of a plan to sell bonds for the first time in its history, officials for the group said Saturday. The bonds’ buyers are expected to be the governments of fast-growing emerging economic powers like China, Russia, Brazil and India. Though the fund has been authorized for decades to raise cash by selling bonds, officials have never done so because they wanted to avoid what amounts to short-term borrowing. But the new plan is a response to the growing political clout of countries like China and Brazil, which have become important economic powers and potentially major contributors to the fund, but which are frustrated by their small share of voting power. As the United States and the European Union have pushed to raise money for the $500 billion lending program to help countries weather the global financial crisis, the big emerging-market countries have demanded that they obtain a bigger voting stake in the fund in exchange for big new financial contributions. The United States has generally supported an overhaul of the organization’s voting structure, but many European countries oppose a dramatic shift, because it would dilute their own voting power. To get around the roadblock, fund officials said they are close to agreeing on a plan to sell bonds to countries including China, Russia, Brazil and India. The bonds would have to be repaid after one or two years, so they would not increase the fund’s permanent resources. But they would provide the fund with a way to raise the entire $500 billion quickly enough to help countries trapped in cash squeezes because of the frozen credit markets. “There was a lot of discussion that the fund would use the possibility to issue notes that could be bought by central banks, which could be a vehicle for some countries to provide resources to the fund,” said Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the I.M.F.’s managing director, after a meeting with officials from member countries here on Saturday. Other officials said the plans were serious and in an advanced stage, though they stopped short of saying that a bond offering was ready to be started. “What this signifies is that the emerging markets are drawing a line in the sand,” said Eswar Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University and a former senior economist for the I.M.F. “From the perspective of the key emerging countries, they are being asked to contribute a very substantial amount of resources in exchange for a very uncertain promise of reform.” China, for example, has only 3.78 percent of the voting power at the I.M.F. But the United States and other wealthy nations are hoping that it contributes $40 billion, or 8 percent, of the new emergency fund. American officials said they supported the proposed bond issue, adding that the most important priority was to raise the necessary money as quickly as possible. The United States, Europe and Japan have each pledged to contribute $100 billion to the new lending facility. Though finance ministers attending the I.M.F.’s annual meeting here have expressed increased optimism that the global financial crisis is easing, American officials and fund officials have also warned that a recovery is still months away and that it will be even longer before unemployment stops climbing and begins to recede. The idea for the new lending program is to provide flexible credit lines to poorer countries that found themselves blindsided by the sudden inability to borrow in global capital markets. Poland, Mexico and Colombia have signed up to borrow from the program, and more countries are expected to do so as well.",

    "source": "Investigation of Spitzer Heats Up <eos> ALBANY — Gov. Eliot Spitzer ’s administration has received a second subpoena from the Albany County district attorney, P. David Soares, reflecting what appears to be a more aggressive approach in his investigation of the administration. The subpoena, issued last week, seeks both public and private e-mail records from the administration. The subpoena was reported on Monday by The Daily News and was confirmed by the governor during a testy appearance at the Capitol on Monday. Mr. Soares’s investigation is his second in the wake of a damaging July report from Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo’s office, which found that members of the Democratic administration had misused the State Police in an effort to discredit Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican Senate majority leader. Mr. Soares’s first investigation, completed in September, backed up Mr. Cuomo’s finding that no laws had been broken, but was criticized because administration officials, including the governor, had not been interviewed under oath. Unlike Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Soares has the jurisdiction to issue subpoenas and compel sworn testimony in this particular case. Mr. Soares began a new investigation last month after the Commission on Public Integrity, a state ethics panel conducting its own inquiry, referred a potential perjury case to his office relating to testimony offered to the commission by Darren Dopp, the governor’s former communications director. In recent weeks he issued a subpoena seeking notes kept by Mr. Dopp. But Mr. Soares held off on bringing charges against Mr. Dopp amid complications in that case earlier this month; the latest subpoena suggests that he is broadening his inquiry. His office declined to comment. The governor made a rare appearance at the Capitol to discuss the recommendations of a commission on higher education — he has been mostly absent from Albany since the Cuomo report was issued — but he became tense when questions turned to the latest developments in the lingering case. “I’ve answered all these questions at length, and obviously we have cooperated fully, take it very seriously, wish it were getting to a conclusion quickly, so we could move on,” the governor said when asked if he had hired a personal lawyer. “We just sit and wait,” he added. “It is their job to do what they have to do. It is our job, and my job to cooperate, which is exactly what I’ve done. I’ve answered all the questions over and over.” Asked whether he had received a subpoena, he said yes, but declined to say what it sought, saying, “I’m not sure what the rules are with respect to that.” A reporter pointed out that the governor, a former prosecutor, did in fact know the rules, adding, “You can disclose whatever you want to disclose.” Responding to the broad subpoena will probably take time, further drawing out what has already been a spate of investigations lasting more than five months. In addition to Mr. Soares and the integrity commission, a Republican-led Senate committee is investigating the matter and currently battling the administration in court for documents and e-mail messages. “He has the chutzpah to say he’s cooperated fully when his lawyer is fighting me tooth and nail on every subpoena,” said Senator George H. Winner Jr., an upstate Republican leading the Senate inquiry, when asked about the governor’s comments on Monday. Republicans have been skeptical of Mr. Soares, a Democrat, like the governor, because he did not conduct interviews under oath in his first inquiry. “He has tried to make it look like he was doing something and did nothing,” Mr. Winner said of Mr. Soares. “I’m hopeful that’s not still the case.” Heather Orth, a spokeswoman for Mr. Soares, said, “As with all cases involving public integrity, we cannot comment.”",

    "source": "Race Tests Democrats’ Viability in West Virginia <eos> PRINCETON, W. Va. — “Pro-jobs. Pro-coal. Pro-life. Vote Republican!!!” reads a prominent sign coming into town. And that ought to be the end of the story here in southern West Virginia, with its beleaguered mining industry and largely white population that fills the pews of evangelical churches on a Wednesday night as readily as on Sunday morning. The region voted overwhelmingly Republican in the presidential contest two years ago, part of the historic defection of West Virginia Democrats, who hold a 2-to-1 registration advantage, from the national party over social issues like abortion and, more recently, opposition to environmental regulation. And yet a Democratic congressman, Nick J. Rahall II, has defiantly held onto his seat here in the sparsely populated Third District, which runs from the rugged Appalachian coal fields in the west to the famed white-water rafting of the New River Gorge. First elected in 1976, Mr. Rahall has had his campaign for a 20th term, against the Republican candidate, Evan Jenkins, become one of the most ferocious House races in the country. There is a torrent of outside money, blistering ads from conservative groups supported by the billionaire Koch brothers and a contest that after nearly $14 million in spending has come down, two weeks before voting, to a tossup. While the race will not affect partisan control of the House, considered safely in Republican hands, it will make a statement about whether Democrats can survive in southern border states. The millions of dollars coursing through the inexpensive television markets of the state in Mr. Rahill’s contest are far more than in the race for West Virginia’s open Senate seat, where a Republican, Shelley Moore Capito, has taken a comfortable lead. If Mr. Rahall hangs on, it will be because his ties to voters cemented over four decades — what supporters call his “brand” — overcome the antipathy of West Virginians to President Obama, and especially White House energy policy that many blame for hard times in coal country. “Republicans have really turned the anger at Obama and the coal issue into an organizing principle,” Mr. Rahall said on Saturday during the Mercer County Democratic Party bean dinner in Princeton. “I probably have the most anti-Obama district represented by a Democrat in the nation.” The race is clouded with distortions from both sides. Mr. Rahall says that Mr. Jenkins would take away miners’ black lung benefits. Mr. Jenkins accuses Mr. Rahall of supporting a carbon tax that raised electric rates. Fact-checkers have been busy debunking both claims . Some of the antipathy of West Virginians to the White House would seem to defy economic self-interest. Mr. Rahall’s district includes some of the poorest counties in the state, where reliance on food stamps, Medicaid and other federal benefits is high. All would be rolled back under budgets passed by the House’s Republican majority. The coal industry’s long decline is economically complex. When Alpha Natural Resources, one of West Virginia’s largest coal operators, warned 1,100 employees of potential layoffs in July, it blamed a worldwide glut of coal, competition from cheaper natural gas and lower-cost coal from western basins — as well as Environmental Protection Agency regulations. But in the charged political arena, complexities fade and both sides identify a sole culprit for the industry’s struggles: the administration’s anti-coal regulations. “Everyone knows Obama declared a war on coal. Nick Rahall stands with him,” says a television ad running this month by Freedom Partners Action Fund, a group supported by Charles G. and David H. Koch. Image Evan Jenkins, the Republican nominee. Democrats hold an advantage in registration, but voters have defected over social issues and environmental regulation. Credit Ryan Stone for The New York Times Mr. Rahall and his supporters have tried to turn the tables by attacking Mr. Jenkins’ wealthy backers. “The Koch brothers coming in here from New York, spending millions trying to elect Evan Jenkins. They’re not welcome, they don’t belong,” a miner says in an ad run by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In a debate last week, Mr. Rahall boasted of “standing up to my party to stop the overreaching, overzealous, job-killing E.P.A. agenda.” It is a tough argument to win, however, given the president’s desire to leave an environmental legacy of lower carbon emissions from power plants, as proposed by the E.P.A. this year. Mr. Rahall has struggled to explain his vote in 2013 for a budget proposal by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which included a $25 per ton carbon tax. He has said that he does not support a carbon tax and that he voted for the liberal budget blueprint, which badly failed in the House, to make a statement against Representative Paul D. Ryan’s Republican budget, with its many cuts to social programs. That plan passed the House but not the Senate. Mr. Jenkins, who served in the State Legislature as a Democrat before switching parties last year , does not buy it. “This president has written off West Virginia,” he said. “He’s written off coal, and unfortunately, we’ve got a congressman who has helped him every step of the way.” The air blitz against Mr. Rahall, 65, began nearly a year ago, almost unheard-of so early, when Republican-leaning national groups like the Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Prosperity — also supported by the Kochs — began attacking his vote for the Affordable Care Act. Democratic groups sensed trouble and jumped in to counter the attacks. “We were effective in at least fighting back,” said Matt Thornton, a spokesman for the House Majority PAC, citing private polls that showed Mr. Rahall rebounding in the spring. The National Republican Congressional Committee, which considers Mr. Rahall one of its top three House targets this year, has pumped more than $2 million into the race. “I think this is the first time people are starting to say maybe we like Nick Rahall but we don’t like what he’s doing in Washington anymore,” said Ian Prior, a spokesman for the Republican campaign committee. Neither side is confident of victory and ads are booked through Election Day, for a total of $13.8 million for the cycle, according to a Democratic group that tracks ad spending. On Saturday, Mr. Jenkins, 54, greeted voters at a celebration of the New River Gorge Bridge, where thousands walked across the impressive structure and watched parachutists drop 876 feet to the riverbed. “I’m Evan Jenkins, running for Congress, hoping for your vote,” the candidate told Nindo Punturi, who was working at one of many vendor booths. “You’ll probably get it,” Mr. Punturi replied. Kathy McGaha, a retiree, also offered support, saying she did not like Mr. Rahall. “He voted for everything with O-bummer,” she said. Bernard Meadows, who worked in a coal mine in Mercer County for two decades “until they shut it down” in the 1980s, said he knew Mr. Rahall but was leaning in a different direction. “I just think it’s time for a change,” he said. But when Mr. Jenkins approached Charles Treadway, he heard a different opinion. “I’ve been with Rahall for years, and I’ve got to stick with Nick,” said Mr. Treadway, a laid-off miner. He said Mr. Rahall was being blamed unfairly for the troubles of the coal industry. “I put it simply: All you’ve got to do is follow the money,” he said, adding that cheap natural gas prices were the reason many miners were out of work.",

    "source": "Brother Shoots Brother, Then Kills Himself in Brooklyn <eos> The discord among the three Athanasatos brothers was nearly four decades deep, and it centered on the family’s two-story brick house in Borough Park, Brooklyn. This week, the fraternal discord turned violent, the police said, when one of the brothers, Thomas, 74, turned a homemade firearm on his 63-year-old brother, James, shooting him in the face during a midnight meeting in front of the house. But from there, any resemblance to the story of Cain and Abel fell away. For the Athanasatos family, violence between brothers was not the end of the misfortune, but only the beginning. When an ambulance appeared shortly after 12:35 a.m. on Wednesday, James was sitting on the curb alone, bleeding profusely. Thomas was gone, retiring to the basement unit of the home where he had been living, supported by his family, since 1974. After daybreak, the third Athanasatos brother, George, 58, visited James in the hospital. From James’s lips, George said, he learned that Thomas was the perpetrator. James told George, “There was no fight; he just shot me,” George recalled in an interview in a hallway at the Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn. With the police in tow Wednesday morning, George went to the home, at 1449 43rd Street, in search of Thomas. George said he had believed Thomas was long gone. “I thought he was on a Greyhound bus headed to Wyoming,” George recalled. Instead, George and the police found him dead in his bed. The Police Department’s chief spokesman, Paul J. Browne, said it appeared Thomas had shot himself in the head with a homemade gun. No note was found, but the reason is hardly beyond the imagination. “The detectives are working under the premise that Thomas believed he had killed his younger brother,” Mr. Browne said, “and then committed suicide.” The police said they did not know of any previous violence among the brothers. James is likely to lose an eye but is expected to survive, George said. “The gun was like something from the pilgrim days, like a musket,” George said. “A pipe with a trigger.” The enmity among the brothers runs deep, at least as far back as 1974, George said, when Thomas moved back in with his parents after a failed marriage. During the interview at the hospital, George avoided using his eldest brother’s name, instead calling him “the bum” or “the guy in the basement.” “This guy was mooching off my mother and father for 40 years,” George said. Since 1974, he added, their mother “was ironing his clothes, taking care of him, giving him an allowance.” Asked whether he felt bad for his deceased brother, George sidestepped the question. “I’m brokenhearted for my brother here,” George said, referring not to Thomas, but to James, who was in the intensive care unit. “James is the one who feels bad.” But George readily acknowledged that James had a softer heart when it came to Thomas. By 8 p.m. Wednesday, James still did not know that Thomas had committed suicide, George said. And when detectives interviewed James about the shooting, James “told the detectives he doesn’t know who shot him,” George said, describing James’s effort to shield his brother. “Can you believe this?” The discord between the brothers grew after their mother died in 2009, 11 years after their father. The house now belonged to all three of them, George said. Thomas continued to live in the basement, and his two brothers together continued to pay him a $600 monthly allowance, just as his mother had in her life, George said. The second-story apartment where the mother lived remained just as it was before she died. The first floor and part of the second floor were rented to several tenants, and it was not long before the brothers began to bicker over how Thomas was handling the rent money he collected from them, George said. And Thomas, although he had lived there for decades, was eager to sell the home, while James, a Staten Island real estate agent, felt differently, George said. On Tuesday, Thomas had invited James to the home to discuss their differences, George said. But when James arrived around 11:30 p.m., there was no rehashing of an old argument. “I think he got sick of waiting” for James to sell the house, George said of Thomas. “Maybe he thought enough is enough.”",

    "source": "Apprentice Hopes to Return Utah to B.C.S. Glory <eos> Brian Johnson went to the University of Utah from Houston as a 17-year-old in 2004. He spent the summer before his freshman year sleeping on a couch in the dingy off-campus apartment of Alex Smith, then the Utes’ starting quarterback. Johnson received simple but specific instructions from Dan Mullen, the Utes’ quarterbacks coach at the time: “Follow Alex, and do everything that he does.” Five years later, Johnson is still trying to follow Mullen’s advice. Johnson has led No. 10 Utah to a 9-0 record, and if the Utes beat No. 11 Texas Christian on Thursday, they would be on the cusp of a berth in a Bowl Championship Series game. Johnson said this year’s team is similar to the 2004 Utes, who ran through the Mountain West and crushed Pittsburgh in the Fiesta Bowl in what became a model for teams outside the six major conferences on how to crash through college football’s glass B.C.S. ceiling. “It’s a great opportunity for my career to come full circle,” Johnson said. Though his career has been pockmarked by injuries, Johnson’s senior season has been hallmarked by his efficiency and his leadership. He has 14 touchdowns and has completed a career-best 66.7 percent of his passes. Much has changed from 2004. Coach Urban Meyer and Mullen left for Florida and Smith exited to become the No. 1 pick in the 2005 N.F.L. draft. But some things are the same. Kyle Whittingham, the defensive coordinator of the 2004 team, is the coach, some of the strategies are similar, and the Utes are led by a poised and intellectual quarterback. “He’s our team leader and is having a big year for us, much like Alex Smith was our team leader in 2004,” Whittingham said. Johnson’s recruiting has similarly humble roots to Smith, who was so lightly regarded as a football prospect that his mother begged him to attend an Ivy League university. When Mullen, now Florida’s offensive coordinator, went to Houston to recruit Johnson at Robert E. Lee High, he came back and told Meyer he found their future quarterback. “Great,” Meyer said. “Show me the film.” There was one problem. Johnson did not have film. In the previous three seasons, he had been the seldom-used backup to Drew Tate, who went on to a successful career at Iowa. But Mullen liked enough of what he saw of Johnson in a spring practice that he promised to come back in September to see a game. Mullen watched Johnson coolly orchestrate the offense, make good decisions and efficient throws. A scholarship offer soon followed. “He wasn’t that highly recruited,” Meyer said. “Dan Mullen did a good job finding him. He’s not that big or that fast. He’s just a heady player that’s a winner.” By the time programs like Illinois, Mississippi State and Louisiana Tech began recruiting him, he was a Ute. Mullen laughed when recalling the story. “He was committed to us before anyone knew who he was,” he said. So a week after he graduated from high school and three months after his 17th birthday, Johnson arrived in Salt Lake City for his apprenticeship. He calls that time one of the highlights of his college career, as Smith guided him through off-season workouts and helped teach him the nuances of studying film. “I was just trying to do everything that he did,” Johnson said. “Come in and be like a sponge.” When Johnson made his official visit to Utah, he was just 16, and Smith joked that he felt like a baby sitter. Despite the age gap, the two became fast friends, and they still talk every week. But Johnson said there were some bumps once he arrived that first summer. Once, he borrowed Smith’s car, a beat-up Suzuki, and the alarm started blaring as he arrived at work. “Everyone thought I was robbing the car,” Johnson recalled with a laugh. “It was loud and obnoxious and went off for a really long time. I finally got Alex on the phone and he told me reach under the steering wheel and jiggle some wires. It was complex, it was crazy.” Johnson has also endured tough moments on the field. He won the starting job as a sophomore in 2005 and ended up as the second-team all-Mountain West quarterback. But a knee injury that November against New Mexico knocked him out for the rest of the season and forced him to redshirt in 2006. “We could have played him, but he was vulnerable to another injury” said the Utah offensive coordinator, Andy Ludwig. “A big part was talking about how good this group would be his senior year. He handled it with class and got bigger and stronger.” When Johnson returned in 2007, he separated his shoulder in the opener and missed the next two games. He came back to be named the most valuable offensive player in a Poinsettia Bowl victory against Navy. This season, the Utes are aiming higher. They beat Michigan in Ann Arbor to open the season, and Johnson led them to an epic comeback against Oregon State. Ludwig, who calls Johnson the smartest quarterback he has coached, recalled talking to Johnson via headset in the waning minutes of the Oregon State game, with the Utes trailing by 11. Johnson became annoyed when he saw fans headed for the exit. “Where are they going?” he asked Ludwig. “They’re going to miss us come back and win.” Sure enough, Johnson hit Bradon Godfrey on a 25-yard touchdown pass and ran in the 2-point conversion to tie the score. The Utah defense held Oregon State to a three-and-out and Johnson got Utah in position to set up Louie Sakoda’s 37-yard field goal as time expired. “I think that’s been a strong point of my individual game for a long time,” Johnson said, “being poised in tough situations.” He will be in another tough situation Thursday, as T.C.U.’s defense ranks second nationally, behind Southern California, yielding an average of 214.5 yards a game. After T.C.U., Utah has games left at San Diego State and at home against No. 17 Brigham Young to complete the season. Three victories separate Johnson from ending his career in perfect symmetry. “Just to see him out there and leading the team is great,” Smith said. “Hopefully they can finish it out. I’m happy that he’s been able to finish off his college career right.”",

    "source": "The Secret Curse of Expert Archers <eos> There is an affliction so feared by elite archers that many in the sport refuse to even say its name. Archery coaches who specialize in treating the problem are sworn not to reveal the identities of archers in its grip, even though they estimate that 90 percent of high-level competitors will fall victim at least once in their careers. Target panic, as the condition is known, causes crack shots to suddenly lose control of their bows and their composure. Mysteriously, sufferers start releasing the bow the instant they see the target, sabotaging any chance of a gold-medal shot. Others freeze up and cannot release at all. Target panic is akin to the yips in baseball and golf, when accomplished athletes can no longer make a simple throw to first base or stroke an easy putt. The results can be mortifying, and archery is filled with tales of those who have caught the curse, never to shoot again. The problem has spawned a cottage industry of coaches, books and specialized accessories that claim to cure target panic. “It’s devastating,” said Terry Wunderle, a professional archery coach whose son, Vic, is an archer on this year’s United States Olympic team. “For someone who has a good case of target panic, I could offer them a thousand dollars if they would just pull the bow back and let the pin float over the bull’s-eye,” Wunderle said, referring to the way archers let their arrows gently bob as they wait for the perfect shot. “I guarantee you, I would not lose the thousand dollars. They can’t do it.” Few admit to being sufferers themselves. “Most shooters will deny that they have it,” said Len Cardinale, an archery coach who said he had treated “hundreds and hundreds” of cases of target panic since the 1970s. “It’s more convenient to say they need a new bow, they have to switch arrows or stand differently.” Wunderle, who himself admitted to battling target panic from time to time, would not reveal whether any of the Olympic archers he coached had faced target panic. “I would not say it if I knew it,” said Wunderle, who also did not want his son interviewed on the subject with the Beijing Olympics a week away. “It’s like being an alcoholic. They don’t say much about it. They don’t fess up to it.” Although few academic studies have been conducted on target panic, several sports psychologists said the condition was nearly identical to the much-analyzed yips in golf and other sports. Ben Hogan and Lee Trevino were notorious sufferers; so was Chuck Knoblauch, the former Yankees second baseman who discovered he could no longer throw to first base. Some say Shaquille O’Neal’s dismal free-throw record is due to a case of the yips. While nearly everyone agrees that the problem is primarily psychological, the latest research suggests that, in some cases, the problem might also be neurological. Sufferers might actually have a disorder known as focal dystonia, a common affliction of musicians caused when the neurons that guide a particular movement — be it aiming a bow or sinking a putt — become worn from overuse. “It’s like a hiccup in the wrist,” said Aynsley M. Smith, research director of the Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine Center, which has conducted three studies on the yips in golf since 2000. Her research, as well as that of a team from New Zealand, has concluded that there are two types of yips — one that is purely psychological and another that is primarily neurological. In both cases, two opposing muscle groups contract at the same time, leading to what Smith and other sport scientists call a “double pull.” Even those with a neurological disorder can develop anxiety that makes the problem worse, said Robert Bell, a sports psychologist at Ball State University who specializes in golf. “It kind of gets into the mind that this could happen, and that’s where the anxiety and the stress come in,” he said. One of the worst cases of target panic that Wunderle treated was in 16-year-old Joey Hunt. Hunt, who has been shooting archery “just about my whole life,” competes with a compound bow, which uses pulleys and levers to flex the bow back compared with the recurve bow used in the Olympics. When Hunt was 9 or 10, he discovered he had lost his preternatural ability to send arrows thunking into the target’s gold center. “I would start to bring the bow down, and as soon as it got anywhere near the target, I would click it right off, right then and there,” said Hunt, who lives in Minot, Me. “It just takes over your mind, and it’s hard to concentrate on other parts of shooting.” Target panic, also known as gold fever because sufferers become obsessed with hitting the gold center, is rich in lore, and online message boards are filled with cautionary testimonials from those who have had the disease. “I could draw the bow without the arrow and had no trouble holding on the dot at all,” wrote a victim on the message board at archerytalk.com , referring to aiming at the center of the target. “But put an arrow on the string and Satan himself was holding it off ... strange stuff some of us endure to play this game!” Lanny Bassham, a former Olympic rifle shooter and mental coach whose clients include the Olympic archer Brady Ellison, said the archery community had a peculiar obsession with target panic, which he noted had a horrifying ring. “The words target panic have induced an unnecessary amount of severity and concern about this condition among archers,” he said. “I think if they had a better word for it, they’d have a lot less problem trying to cure it.” Many archers and their coaches refuse to say target panic. Those words are forbidden around the Nichols household, which is home to the Olympic archer Jennifer Nichols and her younger sister, Amanda, also a world-class competitor. “We try to stay away from the labels that are put on things by people in the archery industry because once you feel you’ve got that label, it’s hard to stay away from it,” said their father, Brent Nichols. “We don’t want to hear those things.” Theories vary on how to cure target panic. Some switch their shooting hand, or change their grip slightly — techniques that have also proved successful in golf. Others use visualization techniques and positive reinforcement. Wunderle advises his clients to imagine seeing and feeling what a good shot is, without focusing on aiming the arrow. “Do not focus on results,” he said. “When you focus on results, it builds anxiety. And anxiety is the kiss of death.” One of the most popular cures is to entirely remove the target. Sufferers instead practice shooting at a blank target, sometimes for weeks at a time, to retrain the mind. “The empty bale restores your confidence in your subconscious,” said Bernie Pellerite, author of the book “Idiot Proof Archery” and a self-described expert on target panic. “Nobody flinches or punches or chokes on an empty bale.” Hunt spent weeks shooting at blank targets, but he also purchased a special release for his bow, which helped retrain him when to shoot. “It’s trying to engrave in your head when you should shoot,” he said. “You just pull it back, let the safety off, and pull it until it decides to go. Then you get used to every shot being perfect.” Hunt placed second in his age group at the Junior Olympic Archery Development national championships in Oklahoma City earlier this month. His target panic, he said, had been cured. For now.",

    "source": "‘Not There’ Campaign Removes Women From Ads for International Women’s Day <eos> Women across New York had vanished. Rosie the Riveter disappeared from her iconic poster in a bus shelter. Serena Williams faded from a giant Beats billboard in Times Square. Gone was Scarlett Johansson from the March cover of Condé Nast’s W magazine. On Sunday, the Clinton Foundation co-opted some 40 existing advertisements, posters and other media, cutting out the women as part of a campaign to call attention to gender inequality. The stunt, the work of the advertising agency Droga5, was intended to drive online traffic to a report by the foundation’s No Ceilings initiative on the status of women and girls across the globe. “This is about putting a really important issue in front of people,” said Katie Dowd, director of digital strategy at the Clinton Foundation. “We’re really trying to create a moment that feels meaningful.” The campaign and the release of the No Ceilings reports coincided with International Women’s Day, observed annually on March 8. The project also marked the 20 years since Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke on women’s rights at a United Nations conference in Beijing. The Clinton Foundation, founded by former President Bill Clinton, is also using online video, radio and social media to represent the idea that women are “not there” yet in terms of gender equality. Female celebrities, including Cameron Diaz and Amy Poehler, star in a video on the campaign’s website, Not-There.org, that explains the effort. The media company iHeartMedia removed women’s voices from well-known songs on 186 of its radio stations nationwide. The foundation also put up short videos on the photo-messaging app Snapchat and encouraged users of social media to change their profile pictures to a woman’s blank silhouette. Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea Clinton blacked out their Twitter profile photos as part of the campaign. The sweeping strategy reflects pressure in the advertising industry to create big, in-your-face campaigns in the hopes of slicing through the barrage of media clutter. To make an impact, marketers are willing to go to extremes to reach a consumer base that already contends with a constant flood of content. “We want to create content that people actually want to engage with,” said Susie Nam, general manager of Droga5. “We don’t want this to be transient.” Along with Condé Nast and Beats, several other companies gave the foundation permission to replace their existing ads with modified ones, including the consumer-products giant Unilever, which owns the Dove and Tresemmé brands, and Under Armour, a Droga5 client. The media space for the stunt was donated or provided at a discount. The foundation covered the cost of printing the altered material. So-called purpose-driven marketing campaigns have taken off in recent years, as companies look for new ways to connect with their consumers, said Jim Stengel, a business consultant who previously worked as chief marketing officer at Procter & Gamble. And gender equality is certainly a hot topic. Just last week, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook and author of the book “Lean In,” introduced a new campaign with the National Basketball Association called Lean In Together that encourages men to stand alongside women to promote gender equality. “Everybody is trying to understand how to lead with a sense of an inspiring purpose at the heart of their brand,” Mr. Stengel said. The Not There campaign “is a great example of a client and these brands looking for a really big idea that breaks through.” For Unilever, whose Dove brand in particular has had a number of successful ad campaigns directed at women , deciding to help the Clinton Foundation spread its message was easy, said Gina Boswell, the executive vice president for personal care for Unilever North America. “It really comes from a responsibility to take action, honestly,” Ms. Boswell said, adding that she hoped adopting the campaign’s message would reflect well on the company itself, whose customers are largely women. By Sunday evening, the Not There website had been viewed at least 104,680 times, according to the foundation. McNally Jackson Books, an independent bookstore in Lower Manhattan, had set up a window display of Condé Nast magazines, including Vogue, Glamour and Allure, with women erased from their covers. The afternoon light glinted off the glass, making the Not There web address somewhat difficult to see. Inside, a small stack of modified magazines sat on a table in the cafe area. None were for sale.",

    "source": "Sam Zell, Who Led Tribune Into Bankruptcy, May Remain <eos> The Tribune Company could well emerge from bankruptcy this fall with much of its current top management intact, according to people briefed on restructuring plans, but it remains unclear whether that might include the top dog himself, Samuel Zell , the chairman and chief executive who took the company private. From the day Tribune filed for bankruptcy in December, it has been clear that Mr. Zell’s $315 million investment and warrants to buy a large share of the company would almost certainly be wiped out. He is being sued on multiple fronts over the $8.2 billion deal that took the company private in December 2007; he has called it a mistake and “the deal from hell”; and some people familiar with the plans are guessing that, when the dust settles, he will be out. But other people close to the restructuring talks, speaking anonymously because the discussions were supposed to remain private, caution that the major creditors have not yet given a clear indication whether they want Mr. Zell to leave or remain in some capacity. Nor has Mr. Zell said clearly whether he wants to go, though he is used to being the man in charge, and his authority would be diminished under new owners. “I think the jury is out on Sam,” one of them said. “That is going to be a point of discussion.” Mr. Zell, 67, made billions in real estate by buying depressed assets where others saw more risk than value, and knowing when to sell them. But that touch faltered when, with the Tribune deal, he moved into an unfamiliar field. Mr. Zell is not granting interviews, according to Tribune, one of the nation’s largest media companies. Its properties include some two dozen television stations and a string of some of the most important newspapers in the country, including The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune and The Baltimore Sun. People briefed on the talks say that the company and leading creditors could agree by September or October on a restructuring plan that would wipe out more than $12 billion of the company’s roughly $13 billion in debt. Such a plan would need the approval of the bankruptcy court in Delaware. In 2007, a group of major banks lent Tribune about $8 billion to go private, but they have since sold much of that debt to other banks and investment firms. Under the anticipated restructuring plan, it is the holders of that senior secured debt — first in line for some repayment — who would end up owning the bulk of the company. That, too, was considered the likely outcome from the start — in fact, the bankruptcy filing last December was in part an attempt to protect the interest of those lenders as Tribune’s cash reserves dwindled. Mr. Zell told senior secured creditors then that, in essence, the company was in their hands, and that making a scheduled payment on junior debt would leave less for them, and asked what they wanted to do. They endorsed bankruptcy. Randy Michaels, the chief operating officer installed by Mr. Zell, recently sent a memo to employees saying that for the most part, management and the lenders agreed on how to run the company. “While the ownership structure of the company is likely to change, current operating management is committed, and intends to remain in place during and after the restructuring,” he wrote. That may have contained an element of bravado, but people briefed on the matter said the major creditors were not unhappy with the current team. “They’re pretty pleased with the way things are running,” one said. For a few more months, at least, Tribune will remain in the limbo of bankruptcy, unable to make any major moves without court approval and uncertain about who its future leader will be. Having stopped payment on its long-term debt, Tribune has continued to cut costs, reached a tentative deal to sell the Chicago Cubs baseball team for $845 million, and built its cash cushion from $317 million when it filed for bankruptcy last December to $743 million by the end of June. But Mr. Zell’s maneuvering also contributed to more than a year of delays in selling the Cubs and, according to some analysts, may have resulted in a lower price than Tribune would have gotten when the economy was stronger. He sought to sell the team and its home, Wrigley Field, separately — the Cubs to a private buyer, the stadium to a government agency and possibly the naming rights to the stadium to a third buyer. But that strategy ran into trouble, and Tribune eventually reverted to an earlier, simpler plan to sell them as a package. It was also Mr. Zell who engineered the complex deal to take the company private, which nearly tripled the company’s debt and left it with too little free cash flow to weather a sharp drop in advertising. A group of employees sued in September 2008, saying that the deal was certain to fail. Last week, a group of Tribune bondholders did the same. Whether either suit can upend the sort of restructuring plan sought by Tribune and its major lenders, or lower Mr. Zell’s chance of remaining in charge, remains to be seen. A spate of high-dollar, high-leverage deals in 2006 and 2007 put hundreds of American newspapers, including many of the biggest, under new ownership — and in most cases put the new owners in financial jeopardy. Mr. Zell’s Tribune takeover was the biggest of those deals, it was one of the last, and it was the first to land in bankruptcy. Since then, Philadelphia Newspapers, owner of that city’s Inquirer and Daily News; The Minneapolis Star Tribune; and others have filed for bankruptcy, while some other publishers have had to restructure their debts to remain solvent.",

    "source": "From a Critic of Tribunals to Top Judge <eos> Back in 2002, a master’s degree candidate at the Naval War College wrote a paper on the Bush administration’s plan to use military commissions to try Guantánamo suspects, concluding that “even a good military tribunal is a bad idea.” It drew little notice at the time, but the paper has gained a second life because of its author’s big promotion: Col. Ralph H. Kohlmann of the Marines is now the chief judge of the military commissions at the naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The system, Judge Kohlmann wrote in 2002, would face criticism for the “apparent lack of independence” of military judges and would have “credibility problems,” the very argument made by Guantánamo’s critics. He said it would be better to try terrorism suspects in federal courts in the United States. “Unnecessary use of military tribunals in the face of reasonable international criticism,” he wrote, “is an ill-advised move.” The paper is becoming a reference work of sorts in the curious history of Guantánamo, which includes a number of former officials who have become outspoken critics, including several former intelligence officers and a former chief military prosecutor. Judge Kohlmann may be the only one who has switched the order, first delivering a fervent attack on Guantánamo and later becoming one of its officials. The existence of his paper, written as an independent study project, has been noted occasionally in court in Guantánamo and elsewhere, though detainees’ advocates say it has become more noteworthy since his appointment as chief judge in March. But the details of his arguments escaped wide public notice until a few weeks ago, when David Glazier, an associate professor of law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, came across the paper in a mass of newly released documents from a case Judge Kohlmann handled in March. The documents showed that defense lawyers had asked Judge Kohlmann about the paper in written questions. “I chose the topic because it was in the news at the time,” he explained. This week, Mr. Glazier said he had been fascinated. “My reaction was, this is pretty amazing, that even the chief judge of the commissions has recognized the horrendous problems of the commission process,” he said. A few weeks ago, Professor Glazier sent an e-mail message to a group of human rights advocates. He included a link to the Pentagon Web site where the paper could be found in the newly released records of the war crimes prosecution of a former detainee, David Hicks. Soon there were new readers for Judge Kohlmann’s five-year-old paper. “It seemed ironic in the extreme,” said David H. Remes, a detainees’ lawyer, who said he learned of the paper from Mr. Glazier’s message. Jameel Jaffer, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who has been an observer at Guantánamo commission proceedings, read the paper at the request of a reporter and said it was “perplexing” that someone who seemed to agree with much that the critics have said about the Guantánamo legal system was now helping to run it. As to the judge’s arguments, Mr. Jaffer said, “He was absolutely right.” Pentagon officials declined to discuss Judge Kohlmann’s paper this week, but in the past they have said the commissions give detainees many important protections, including the right to be represented by a lawyer. Pentagon spokesmen said Judge Kohlmann declined to comment, and they said the telephone number for his chambers could not be revealed for security reasons. Judge Kohlmann, a 49-year-old New Jersey native, is a decorated career officer with a down-to-business demeanor. He was a military judge in the first military commission system before it was struck down by the Supreme Court last year. He was appointed the chief judge in March by the Pentagon, after Congress created a new military commission system to replace the old. Questioned about his paper by defense lawyers in March, he said he could not recall whether he had received a grade. Mr. Jaffer said he would have given the judge an A. The paper was prickly at times, referring to Bush administration “spinmeisters” and dismissing the argument that the new challenges of fighting terrorism meant that civilian judges and juries would be endangered by federal trials. Prior terrorism and organized crime cases, he wrote, showed that “the existing United States criminal justice system does not have to be put aside simply because the potential defendants have scary friends.” Judge Kohlmann has not disavowed the paper. But the documents show that in March, perhaps illustrating the pressures of responsibility, he told defense lawyers for Mr. Hicks that he wanted to correct a misstatement in his paper. He had been incorrect, he said, when he wrote that President Bush’s original order establishing military commissions “essentially states” that fundamental fairness would not be a part of commission trials. “That I now believe to be incorrect,” he said. One of Mr. Hicks’s lawyers, Joshua L. Dratel, said this week that Judge Kohlmann had seemingly reconciled his past as a critic of the system with his new role as one of its managers. “He seemed to me,” Mr. Dratel said, “like a guy who was given a mandate to make the system work, and he was not going to let anyone interfere with it.”",

    "source": "Days of Rising Interest Rates May Be Numbered <eos> RARELY do new years and significant changes coincide as they did this week. The year was less than a week old when it emerged that the Federal Reserve appeared to be easing off the brakes on the economy, the airline industry might be poised for revival and traditional company pensions took a significant step closer to extinction. RATE SHIFT? Federal Reserve policy makers may be close to ending 18 months of raising interest rates, according to minutes of a meeting last month of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The suggestion spurred a rally in the stock market and sent the dollar lower against European and Asian currencies. The minutes said \"most members\" of the committee agreed that \"given the information now in hand, the number of additional firming steps required probably would not be large.\" Firming steps are rate increases. The Fed has raised its main short-term rate in increments of one quarter of a percentage point at each of its last 13 meetings, increasing it to 4.25 percent from 1 percent. Committee members noted that wages have risen modestly despite strong economic growth, and that last year's spike in energy prices had only a \"muted\" effect on prices over all. The change came as the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, neared the end of an 18-year tenure. Ben S. Bernanke is scheduled to become chairman on Feb. 1, assuming the Senate confirms him this month. GAINING ALTITUDE -- Less than two years after it started low-fare service from its base at Dulles International Airport near Washington, Independence Air stopped flying Thursday and took steps to liquidate. The airline filed for bankruptcy protection in November, but it was unable to line up fresh financing that would let it cope with higher fuel costs and increased competition. While that is bad news for the airline's 2,600 employees, it may be good news for other domestic carriers. Fewer planes in the air could ease the pressure on airlines to sell seats at a loss, analysts said, just as fuel costs are easing. That combination could help the airlines move back into the black after four years of losses that total about $30 billion. Analysts expect five airlines to return to profit this year: American, Continental, Alaska, JetBlue and AirTran. Profit at Southwest, which remained profitable through the slump, is likely to increase 15 percent this year, analysts said. PENSION OVERBOARD -- In a move that could prompt still more big companies to abandon traditional defined-benefit pension plans, I.B.M. said it would freeze pension benefits for its American employees in 2008 and offer them only a 401(k) retirement plan after then. With the announcement, I.B.M. joined a growing number of big employers -- including Verizon Communications, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola and Sears -- that have frozen their pension plans. In doing so, the companies no longer let their employees build up retirement benefits to reflect higher pay and additional years of employment. Benefits already earned are unaffected. At I.B.M., the change will affect 117,000 employees in the United States. It will not cut the benefits being paid to 125,000 American retirees. I.B.M. projected that it would save $2.5 billion to $3 billion over the next five years as it carries out the change worldwide. MEDIA MAKEOVER -- Dow Jones & Company, which has been struggling financially since the bursting of the dot-com bubble began to bleed advertising from its flagship newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, chose its chief operating officer, Richard F. Zannino, as its next chief executive. He will succeed Peter R. Kann, who is expected to continue as chairman of the board until the annual meeting in April 2007, the year in which he turns 65 and faces mandatory retirement. His wife, Karen Elliott House, the publisher of The Journal, was considered the other leading candidate to succeed him. After not being chosen, Ms. House said she would leave the company. Dow Jones's profit fell 16 percent in the third quarter after The Journal's new weekend edition increased costs, although the company said its fourth-quarter earnings would be better than expected. The Journal's managing editor, Paul E. Steiger, is also facing retirement; with the changes, it is not clear who will choose his successor. HEALTHSOUTH HANGOVER -- Richard M. Scrushy, the former chief executive of the HealthSouth Corporation, was acquitted of fraud charges in a federal trial last year, but a state judge in Alabama said he must repay $47.8 million in bonuses that HealthSouth awarded him for achieving revenue goals; some of the sales used to compute revenue later turned out to be false. The ruling by Judge Allwin E. Horn III came in a shareholder lawsuit filed in 2002, before Mr. Scrushy was found not guilty on charges that he directed a $2.7 billion accounting fraud at HealthSouth, a nationwide chain of rehabilitation hospitals and clinics. Mr. Scrushy, who said he planned to appeal Judge Horn's decision, faces unrelated federal charges that he bribed former Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama. He pleaded not guilty to that charge. TAKEOVER FIGHT -- In a rare hostile takeover by a European company in the United States, BASF, the German chemicals maker, offered $4.9 billion for the Engelhard Company of Iselin, N.J., which developed the catalytic converter and specializes in manufacturing pollution-control systems. Engelhard rebuffed the $37-a-share offer, which represented almost a 23 percent premium over its year-end stock price. Still, Engelhard shares jumped to $38, suggesting that investors think someone will take over the company. BASF said that if it was successful in buying Engelhard, it did not anticipate big job cuts.

Just a few years ago, South Sudan accomplished what seemed impossible: independence . Of all the quixotic rebel armies fighting for freedom in Africa, the South Sudanese actually won. Global powers, including the United States , rallied to their side, helping to create the world’s newest country in 2011, a supposed solution to decades of conflict and suffering. Now, with millions of its people hungry or displaced by civil war , a radical question has emerged: Should South Sudan lose its independence? Image South Sudanese celebrated at a ceremony marking the independence of their country in Juba in 2011. Credit Tyler Hicks/The New York Times As international frustrations and worries grow, some momentum is growing for a proposal for outside powers to take over South Sudan and run it as a trusteeship until things calm down. Several academics and prominent opposition figures support the idea , citing East Timor, Kosovo and Bosnia as places where, they say, it has worked, though of course there are plenty of cautionary tales where outside intervention failed, like Somalia and Iraq. The Ugandan scholar Mahmood Mamdani recently floated a plan in which the African Union would take the lead in setting up a transitional government for South Sudan. Ideally, Mr. Mamdani said, none of the current South Sudanese politicians who have helped drag their nation into civil war would be able to participate, and the trusteeship would last around six years, requiring United Nations support.

Credit Tyler Hicks/The New York Times “The response to the crisis will need to be as extraordinary as the crisis,” he said. But there is one not-so-little problem. Many South Sudanese might not go for it. According to James Solomon Padiet, a lecturer at Juba University, most members of the nation’s largest ethnic group — the Dinka, who include South Sudan’s embattled president, Salva Kiir — are adamantly set against an international takeover. While smaller ethnic groups would welcome it, he said, the powerful Dinka see it as an affront to their sovereignty. For that matter, so does Mr. Padiet, a soft-spoken scholar who is not a Dinka. He called trusteeship “offensive” because South Sudan has a potential crop of good leaders waiting in the wings who haven’t had a chance to rule. Still, Mr. Padiet conceded, the country desperately needs help.

Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times “As we speak now,” he said, “South Sudan is at crossroads of disintegration or total fragility.” Clashes have spread to new areas of the country, and ethnic-based militias are mobilizing in the bush. It’s all a staggering plunge from the country’s birth. I, along with hundreds of other journalists, was standing in a crowd that felt like a million people on July 9, 2011, the insanely hot day when South Sudan broke off from Sudan . The sense of pride, sacrifice, hope and jubilation will be hard to forget. For decades, South Sudanese rebels had battled the better-armed, Arab-dominated central government of Sudan. They fought in malarial swamps and on sweltering savannas, incredibly hostile environments where it’s hard to survive, let alone wage a guerrilla war on a shoestring. The South Sudanese had absorbed bombings and massacres. The Arabs stole their children and turned them into slaves. As a result, many South Sudanese were scattered across the four corners of the earth — the famous Lost Boys, but also many Lost Girls, ripped from their families and forced to flee to cold foreign places that they had never envisioned.

Lost Boys swigged White Bull (the local beer) next to hardened guerrillas bobbing their heads to reggae rap. All around us, there seemed to be a real appreciation of what had been achieved and what lay ahead. Most important, there was unity. That crumbled quickly , undermined by old political rivalries , ethnic tension and a greed for South Sudan’s one main export: oil. The fault line was the most predictable one, the Dinka versus the Nuer. The two biggest ethnic groups had alternated between allies and enemies throughout South Sudan’s liberation wars. Starting in December 2013, after a breakdown between their political leaders, who not so long ago had been hailed as heroes, Nuer and Dinka militias began killing each other and civilians across the country, especially in ethnically mixed areas.

The horror has been meticulously documented. Still, it goes on. For years, the United Nations has stationed thousands of peacekeepers in the country, but often they have not intervened. In 2012, shortly after independence, I rushed to a remote town, Pibor, where hundreds had just been massacred by an ethnic militia. I saw one woman who was literally holding her arm together — she had been blasted by a Kalashnikov — as she sat in a medical tent that smelled of decaying flesh. She stared at the wall, not making a murmur. I interviewed peacekeepers who told me how they had watched civilians get shot right in front of them, yet the peacekeepers felt too scared to raise their rifles. Image United Nations peacekeeping troops outside a civilian protection site in Juba in 2016. Credit Albert Gonzalez Farran/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images United Nations officials in Juba have been excoriated for failing to spring into action and effectively step between Mr. Kiir and Riek Machar, the former vice president and the most influential Nuer, as their rivalry intensified and grew into nationwide bloodshed. This is a big reason some people think an international trusteeship will never work. “Having completely failed in the international state-building project, now we’re going to move to an international takeover? With what army?” asked John Prendergast, who has been working on South Sudan for 30 years and co-founded the Enough Project, an anti-genocide group. “Would the same international bureaucrats that undertook massive state-building experiments in Iraq and Afghanistan come to Juba to lead another failed political intervention?” he added. “It all seems fantastical, doomed and extremely unlikely.” Image A malnourished South Sudanese mother sitting with her son, who was being treated for severe malnourishment and other complications at a tent hospital in Malakal in 2014. Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Other scholars take a middle view. Amir Idris , chairman of Fordham’s African and African-American studies department and a frequent writer on South Sudan, said an international trusteeship should be considered — but only as a last resort. He says the most important issue is that a new government be built with new people, including academics and technocrats. “South Sudan has no chance of transitioning itself to a functioning state unless the edifice of the current leadership is brought down,” he said. Bronwyn Bruton, the deputy director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council, called South Sudan’s leaders “such a disaster.” She said Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar were “corrupt,” “self-interested” and “willing to stoke ethnic conflict and commit horrible violence in pursuit of power.” “Genocide is beginning to look inevitable,” she said. “The situation could hardly be more hopeless.” But she worries that no country has the appetite to spearhead a meaningful intervention. The Obama administration considered several ways to help usher in a political transition, a former administration official said, but eventually concluded it was not feasible. It’s not as if Mr. Kiir or Mr. Machar or their inner circles, who are widely believed to continue to profit from oil and conflict , are going to volunteer to step aside. Thousands of armed men are intensely loyal to them, and even a few friends left in Western capitals make the case that the South Sudanese government has stabilized Juba in recent months, has become more inclusive and should be allowed to stay. One glimmer of hope comes from across the continent. In the last few days, troops from several West African countries banded together to eject Gambia’s president , who tried to stay in power illegally. If such resolve was demonstrated in this part of Africa, then maybe, the interventionists argue, South Sudan’s leaders could be pushed aside and the country would be allowed to breathe.",

    "source": "Cellphone Makers Hope for a Blockbuster Summer <eos> The hype machine started months ago. Opening weekends are upon us. High up in executive suites, the hope is that this summer’s new releases will cause lines to snake around the block. The cellphone industry looks a lot like the movie industry nowadays. Some highly anticipated phones — including the Palm Pre, an updated iPhone and new phones using the Android operating system from Google — have focused the industry’s efforts on the crucial months between Memorial Day and Labor Day . In the past, “nobody gave a darn about mobile phones — they weren’t headline grabbers,” said Charles Wolf, a cellphone industry analyst with Needham & Company. “This summer will be really interesting. It could be potentially the most exciting time in this market.” The season’s releases began last week, when T-Mobile announced the introduction of the Sidekick LX and AT& T unveiled the Samsung Jack, ballyhooing it as “another hit crossover smartphone in the tradition of the Blackjack and Blackjack II.” But the season’s most compelling phone drama will start the first week in June, when Sprint will begin selling the Palm Pre, people briefed on the company’s plans said. Palm, a once-iconic device maker that has fallen on hard times, has been hyping the Pre for months as an iPhone killer, but the company has given few peeks to analysts and reviewers. Analysts say the stakes are high for Sprint Nextel, which has exclusive rights to the phone in the United States, but even higher for Palm, which is based in Silicon Valley. “This is make or break for Palm,” said Mr. Wolf, noting that Palm, also the maker of Treo and Centro phones, lost about $98 million in the last quarter, consistent with losses in other recent quarters. “It’s not make or break for Sprint, but clearly Sprint is in trouble, too, and needs a hit.” Lynn Fox, a spokeswoman for Palm, played down the importance of the Pre itself, saying it was the first “in a long line” of devices that will use Palm’s new mobile operating system. “The Pre isn’t a bet-the-company device,” Ms. Fox said. Because the smartphone market still has room to grow (according to Google, it is estimated that out of the four billion mobile devices in the world, only 100 million are smartphones), manufacturers hope there is room for more than one winner. How is success measured for cellphones? A flop will sell fewer than 100,000 units, a hit at least one million, and a runaway success five times that or more, analysts say. In July 2007, the iPhone’s first month on the market, 80,000 people bought one. Apple went on to sell iPhones, including the 3G version, to more than five million Americans, according to comScore. Big phone releases happen year-round, but there is a concentration in the summer. That way, phone carriers and manufacturers can take advantage of two crucial selling seasons: back to school and the holidays, said Mark Donovan, an analyst with comScore. As soon as June 8, just a few days after the expected release of the Pre, Apple may introduce a third version of its iPhone at the company’s annual conference for software developers. The phone could become available a month later, though analysts and Apple rumormongers say it might also come later in the summer. Analysts generally agree that the phone will have an upgraded camera, a faster processor and better location services. Apple, of course, has less risk than other phone makers; its iPhone is already a blockbuster. That said, if the company fails to keep innovating, it risks losing its buzz. Jennifer Bowcock, an Apple spokeswoman, declined to comment on the company’s plans for a new phone. Also in June, Samsung has said, it plans to release the i7500, its first phone based on the Android operating system, but it has not said when that phone will come to the United States. HTC recently released the Android-equipped Magic in Europe. And Motorola says it plans to start selling several Android phones this summer, phones the company is counting on, given its desperate need for a hit. Trickling into the market — though release dates are uncertain — are a host of phones using a new mobile operating system from Microsoft. Microsoft’s current mobile platform has not met expectations. The hope is that a new operating system, Windows Mobile 7, will reboot the franchise. Mr. Wolf of Needham said that the concept of sexy phones equaling or superseding network quality as a selling point for consumers started in earnest in 2006. By then, carriers realized, most adults already had cellphone service and needed to be inspired to buy new phones or seduced into switching carriers. An early example came in July 2006, when Verizon Communications introduced the LG Chocolate, which was preceded by a teaser advertising campaign that promoted a release date. In November 2007, Verizon began another big campaign, called “Next phones now,” that included the LG Voyager, LG Venus, Blackberry Pearl and Samsung Juke (not to be confused with the Jake, or the Jack). Brenda Raney, a spokeswoman for Verizon, argued that blockbuster phones cannot exist without a great network. “Consumers know if you don’t have a good wireless experience, what good is the phone?” Mr. Donovan of comScore disagreed. “No one’s out there saying the Palm Pre is going to be a hit because the call quality is magnificent,” he said. Consumers are increasingly focused on the latest devices, he said, and manufacturers have only a short time to draw consumers’ attention. “Phones don’t stand the test of time,” Mr. Donovan said. “I look at my personal handset museum, and the coolest thing I had in my pocket eight years ago is laughable.” When it comes to phones, he added, “there are no ‘Citizen Kanes’ out there.”",

    "source": "WikiLeaks Mirror Sites Appear by the Hundreds <eos> LONDON — The battle lines between supporters of the whistle-blowing Web site WikiLeaks and its detractors began to form on Sunday, as supporters erected numerous copies of the site on the Internet and the United States put pressure on Switzerland not to offer a haven to the site’s founder, Julian Assange. Since several major Internet companies cut off services to WikiLeaks in recent days, activists have created hundreds of mirror sites , Web sites that host exact copies of another site’s content, making censorship difficult. The collective Anonymous , an informal but notorious group of hackers and activists, also declared war on Sunday against enemies of Mr. Assange, calling on supporters to attack companies that do not support WikiLeaks and to spread the leaked material online. Meanwhile, the American ambassador to Switzerland, Donald S. Beyer Jr., responded to signs that Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks might seek refuge in that country, warning in the weekly magazine NZZ am Sonntag that the Swiss “should very carefully consider whether to provide shelter to someone who is on the run from the law.” Since the release of classified diplomatic cables a week ago, from a batch of more than 250,000 obtained by WikiLeaks, the Web site has been bombarded by cyberattacks and abandoned by Internet companies like PayPal , an online payment service that had accepted donations for the site, and Amazon , which had rented it server space. WikiLeaks said that PayPal had “surrendered to U.S. government pressure,” but the government has not acknowledged involvement in efforts to try to disable the site. On Friday, WikiLeaks sought refuge in a diffuse web of financial and Internet infrastructure spread across Europe, particularly in Switzerland. It moved to wikileaks.ch , a domain registered to the Swiss Pirate Party, a political organization that shares many of Mr. Assange’s aims. A Swiss-Icelandic company, Datacell, will process donations instead of PayPal, and the WikiLeaks site shows that Mr. Assange is accepting direct donations into a Swiss bank account held with the financial arm of the Swiss postal service. But that solace may be short lived: a spokesman for the financial arm of Swiss Post, Marc Andrey, also told NZZ am Sonntag on Sunday that it was “reviewing” its relationship with Mr. Assange subject to proof that he has Swiss residency, owns property or does business in the country. A message seeking comment from Mr. Assange’s British lawyer was not immediately returned. The Internet group Anonymous, which in the past has taken on targets as diverse as the Church of Scientology and Iran, disseminated a seven-point manifesto via Twitter and other social networking sites pledging to “kick back for Julian.” Gregg Housh, who has previously worked on such campaigns with Anonymous, said by telephone from Boston that he had noticed an orchestrated effort under way to attack companies that have refused to support WikiLeaks and to post multiple copies of the leaked material. The Anonymous manifesto singled out PayPal, which cut off ties with WikiLeaks for “a violation” of its policy on promoting illegal activities, a company statement said. “The reason is amazingly simple,” Mr. Housh said of the campaign. “We all believe that information should be free, and the Internet should be free.” By late Sunday, there were at least 208 WikiLeaks mirror sites up and running. “Cut us down,” said a message on the WikiLeaks Twitter feed on Sunday, “and the stronger we become.”",

    "source": "Da Vinci, Retrofitted for the Modern Age <eos> WHEN Thomas Alva Edison was starting in business, his first patent was for an automated vote-tallying machine to let legislators know instantly which measures had passed and which had been voted down. He sold not a one. It seems that legislators, accustomed to schmoozing and politicking right through a vote’s tally, didn’t want to speed the process. But with the resilience he would show throughout his life, Edison refused to view that episode as a failure. Instead, he used it to set the stage for future decisions: He would pursue only those innovations that had a verifiable market from the beginning. He went on to earn 1,092 more patents and to become a symbol of American ingenuity. Ancient history, right? Not so fast. True, Edison has long been revered for changing the face of modern civilization. But beyond the material aspects of his success, he demonstrated that creativity and innovation could result from a set of identifiable and repeatable processes. Like Leonardo da Vinci before him, Edison kept extensive notebooks detailing every idea he ever had and every experiment he ever tried. He established the world’s first modern research and development laboratory, hiring teams of experts in things as diverse as model-making and chemical engineering. Not only did he invent the incandescent light bulb, Edison also created the electric power industry required for the bulb to light up millions of homes and businesses. As entrepreneurs and Fortune 500 executives alike seek creative solutions to 21st-century business problems, the triumphs of Edison and a number of other historical figures are being revisited for the innovation lessons they can teach. “I use historical figures as models to talk about leadership and innovation,” explains Alan Axelrod, author of a new book, “Edison on Innovation: 102 Lessons in Creativity for Business and Beyond,” as well as the earlier “Elizabeth I CEO,” “Patton on Leadership” and “Eisenhower on Leadership.” Before video games and 24-hour television, Mr. Axelrod says, youngsters grew up reading biographies of famous people so they could learn from their lives and emulate them. “We should turn more to these historical figures today,” he says, “because why not model ourselves on the very best examples we can find?” Michael J. Gelb, a corporate consultant, is co-author with Edison’s great-grandniece Sarah Miller Caldicott of “Innovate Like Edison, ” a 2007 book. Mr. Gelb began his research of historical figures by turning to da Vinci, a childhood hero. “His was a balanced brain in that he used the left and right hemisphere of his cerebral cortex equally and to their fullest, something I’ve tried to get people from DuPont and Microsoft and Merck to do over the last 30 years,” Mr. Gelb says. “Corporate executives today tend to be overly linear, logical, analytical. I’m trying to help them use their intuition and artistic capabilities. If you want to compete in the challenging world of international business, you can’t just rely on half a brain.” In his 1998 book “How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci,” Mr. Gelb outlines seven principles that he believes define da Vinci’s work:  Curiosità, or curiosity, marking his insatiable quest for knowledge and continuous improvement.  Dimostrazione, or demonstration, through which he learned by personal experience rather than taking others’ reports for granted.  Sensazione, or sensation, using the senses to sharpen observation and response.  Sfumato, a painting technique employed by da Vinci to create an ethereal quality in his work, showing his ability to embrace ambiguity and change.  Arte/scienza, or the science of art, which he demonstrated in his whole-brain thinking.  Corporalità, or “of the body,” representing his belief that a healthy mind requires a healthy body.  Connessione, or connection, for his habit of weaving together multiple disciplines around a single idea. That last principle has been popularized by the educational consultant Tony Buzan as “mind mapping,” or nonlinear, radial diagramming of words and ideas around a main concept. Mr. Buzan studied the notebooks of both da Vinci and Edison while developing mind mapping, and it’s a tool that Mr. Gelb often uses with his corporate clients. Mr. Gelb says that one man, a chemist at DuPont, reported to him that he was reaching impasses on four seemingly unrelated projects and wasn’t sure how to proceed. Mr. Gelb suggested that the chemist create a mind map of the projects side-by-side on a single, enormous sheet of paper. The man later wrote to him in a letter: “The moment I finished the map and I surveyed the whole thing, a solution literally popped off the page. I saw a connection that I never would have made otherwise.” The chemist later received a patent for the innovation. “People think I’m a genius because I’m helping people without knowing anything about their particular industry,” Mr. Gelb said. Asked to name other historical figures who offer lessons on innovation, both Mr. Gelb and Mr. Axelrod rattled off lists including George S. Patton and Queen Elizabeth I. (Mr. Axelrod added Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower.) Each of these personalities responded innovatively to the rapid changes taking place around them, drawing on the expertise of advisers while continuing to build on earlier successes. Like Edison, who built new innovations on top of previous inventions, innovative leaders never declare an invention “done,” Mr. Axelrod says. “Everything ultimately became the source of something new later,” he says. “It’s like the difference between a rich person and a wealthy person. A rich person has a lot of money and buys things. A wealthy person invests in things that make more money. It’s creating ongoing wealth out of your intellectual capital.”",

    "source": "DreamWorks Posts Loss <eos> GLENDALE, Calif., Feb. 27 (AP) — DreamWorks Animation SKG, the studio behind animated movies like “Shrek” and “Madagascar,” said Tuesday that it swung to a fourth-quarter loss on costs to write off “Flushed Away,” which performed poorly at the box office. The company lost $21.3 million, or 20 cents a share, in contrast to year-earlier earnings of $63.2 million, or 61 cents a share, which included a tax benefit and strong performance from the “Madagascar” DVD, which was released into the home video market in the 2005 quarter. DreamWorks said the recent quarter’s was hurt by a charge of 80 cents a share related to the write-off of some costs for “Flushed Away.” Revenue grew 18 percent to $204.3 million from $172.9 million in the year-earlier period, with about half of sales driven by the home video release of “Over the Hedge.” But costs associated with sales — including the write-off — more than doubled to $219.9 million.",

    "source": "Entrepreneur’s Act of Faith Bred on the Gridiron <eos> Newark ALONG a chain-link stretch of Frelinghuysen Avenue, in the shadow of an old red-brick housing project in a far corner of the South Ward, the brightest, freshest block is a new strip mall of the familiar variety that would hardly draw a second glance in many other places: a dollar store, a coin laundry and a Subway owned by a man everybody seems to know, even if they don’t. “Everything’s beautiful,” Altarik White said on a recent rainy evening to one more customer who hailed him by name. “No problems, no problems.” Mr. White’s name has been widely known across the city for more than two decades, ever since he was a star running back for Malcolm X Shabazz High School who once scored five touchdowns in a single game and was, as he said, “bigger, stronger and faster than everyone else.” He set school records for rushing and scoring at William Paterson University, packed away his pro dreams after separating his shoulder at the Miami Dolphins’ training camp, and then came back home to teach and coach football. In 2006 he led the Weequahic High School team to the state championship in its group, a jolt of good news at a school that had endured too much bad. “When I had a football in my hand, there was nothing that could stop me from reaching the end zone,” said Mr. White, 37, as the old-school soul he favors over rap played in the background. “Instead of running over linebackers, I’m tackling business now.” When Mayor Cory A. Booker gave his State of the City speech in February, some of the loudest applause came when he announced something far less dramatic than the drop in the number of murders: a loan to Mr. White from the Brick City Development Corporation that would allow him to open the Subway he had long been planning. Not downtown, where there were already several others, but in a neighborhood where national chains, and foods that haven’t been fried, were in short supply. Mr. White’s Subway opened in April, an act of faith in his city as much as of entrepreneurship. “In our community, there’s not a lot of healthy places to go — no Whole Foods, no Stop & Shop, just a bunch of Chinese stores, hamburger joints and fried chicken places,” said Mr. White, whose Subway is on the other side of Weequahic Park from the school where he coaches and works as a substance awareness counselor. Next door is Seth Boyden Terrace, a public housing project where a triple shooting took place last year. “Who’s to say that people, because they live in Seth Boyden, that they don’t deserve good food at an affordable price,” he said. “What I say to people who say, ‘That’s a tough place,’ is, ‘Yeah, well, guess what — it’s a tough world we live in.’ ” He knows just how tough it is: his father was absent for much of his youth and his mother died when he was in high school. “So will we all just close our doors and act like it’s not happening?” he asked. Opportunities beyond Newark have beckoned, including coaching in the National Football League, he said, but he has resisted. “I’m not ready for players to tell me what they ain’t going to do, and that’s what happens when you get there, because you’re just the coach,” he said. “Now when I bark a command, five or six people pop their heads up and they’re ready to do it.” His voice travels far in the store, too. “Keep it wrapped up until she gets back,” he told Shakia Standifer, 18, who had just made a roast beef sub for a customer who needed a quick cash-machine visit to pay for it. “He treats you how life’s going to treat you,” said Ms. Standifer, 18, a Weequahic senior and the football team statistician, one of four students among his 10 employees. She is headed to Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison in the fall to study forensic psychology. The last year has been tough on Mr. White: His younger brother, Shahib, 29, who played football at Rutgers and was an assistant coach at Weequahic, committed suicide last summer, and the school’s beloved principal, Ronald G. Stone, died of a heart attack last fall. He has lived for the past three years in Piscataway, to be closer to his young daughter from a previous marriage, but he has grown restless counting squirrels and watching deer from his backyard. He owns three houses in the South Ward and hopes to move back soon. He has begun to read the business section of the newspaper more carefully, discovering just how much coaching has in common with selling. “I could sell white gloves to a nun eating barbecue ribs,” he said. When he was playing football he studied the films of the opposing teams, analyzing the defenses they would try to stop him with, and then lie in bed the night before kickoff, playing the game in his head, making his moves and seeing the yards pile up. What he sees in his head now are mounting sales figures, new stores — he has plans to open two more — and the difference one sandwich shop can make in a neighborhood that never had one. One afternoon earlier in the week, some neighborhood boys drifted over and, as often happens when Mr. White is around, a football appeared. The parking lot became a gridiron. “I don’t run anymore,” he said. “I’m the spot quarterback” — the guy who stands in one place and throws passes, hoping somebody catches them.",

    "source": "Franklin Mieuli, Offbeat N.B.A. Owner, Dies at 89 <eos> Franklin Mieuli, the unconventional and popular owner of the Golden State Warriors for nearly a quarter century who in 1975 brought the franchise its only National Basketball Association championship in 48 years on the West Coast, died Sunday. He was 89. The death was announced by the Warriors, who said he died of natural causes in the Bay Area. A local boy who made good, Mr. Mieuli (pronounced MEW-lee), grew up in San Jose and ran a successful radio production company. He bought a partial stake in the Warriors when the team moved to the Bay Area from Philadelphia in 1962 (taking with them the star center Wilt Chamberlain) and became a majority shareholder shortly thereafter. Though it played its home games in several arenas throughout the Bay Area — most frequently at the Cow Palace , in Daly City — the team was called the San Francisco Warriors throughout the 1960s. Mr. Mieuli moved the team to Oakland in 1971 and changed its name to the Golden State Warriors; he sold the team in 1986. Often referred to as eccentric, Mr. Mieuli eschewed business dress and grooming; heavily bearded, he favored jeans, Hawaiian shirts and a deerstalker cap, à la Sherlock Holmes. When events became too complicated and he needed time to think or to avoid the press, he would simply disappear for a few days. He kept a number of motorcycles, his preferred mode of transportation, and occasionally forgot where he left them. “I had too many motorcycles and too short a memory,” he recalled in a 2008 interview with The San Francisco Chronicle. He was, however, cagey and self-aware. “Make no mistake,” Hank Greenwald, a former Warriors radio announcer, said in a 1971 Sports Illustrated article about Mr. Mieuli, “Franklin is the one man in the world who works hard at having people underestimate him.” He was not an owner with especially deep pockets, and his stewardship of the Warriors sometimes appeared quixotic. With the team in a financial bind in 1965, he traded Chamberlain back to Philadelphia, where the Syracuse Nationals had moved and become the 76ers. “I don’t mean that I personally dislike him,” Mr. Mieuli said of Chamberlain after the trade. “He’s a good friend of mine. But the fans in San Francisco never learned to love him. I guess most fans are for the little man and the underdog, and Wilt is neither. He’s easy to hate, and we were the best draw in the N.B.A. on the road, when people came to see him lose.\" Mr. Mieuli opposed league expansion and opposed the merger of the N.B.A. with its rival league, the American Basketball Association. (After years of negotiations, the merger took place in 1976.) He opposed the 3-point shot. He pursued the star forward Rick Barry as if he were a long-lost son, signing him out of college in 1965, losing him to the A.B.A. two years later and re-signing him in 1972. Barry went on to lead the Warriors’ 1975 championship team in scoring with an average of 30.6 points per game. Mr. Mieuli, a son of Italian immigrants, was born on Sept. 14, 1920, in San Jose, Calif., where his father was a gardener who eventually started a successful nursery. He attended the University of Oregon and served in the Navy during World War II. He worked in marketing for a local brewery, sponsor of radio broadcasts of San Francisco 49ers football games. In 1954, according to the team, he produced the first telecast of a 49ers game. He subsequently bought a small share of the team, and a few years later, having entered the radio and television production business himself, he landed the rights to produce not only their games but also those of the newly arrived major league baseball franchise, the San Francisco Giants. At his death, he retained a 5 percent interest in the 49ers. Mr. Mieuli’s marriage ended in divorce, and he had a long partnership with Blake Green. His survivors include Ms. Green, three children and seven grandchildren.",

    "source": "Romney and Obama Resume Economic Attacks <eos> IRWIN, Pa. — The argument between Mitt Romney and President Obama over who is better suited to help American workers get back on their feet got personal again on Tuesday, with Mr. Romney saying he was “ashamed” of Mr. Obama for giving government loans to well-connected donors. The overarching dispute is which candidate’s view of government might lift a struggling economy: Mr. Romney’s belief in lower taxes and fewer regulations, or Mr. Obama’s vision of a vital role for government. But the policy debate has descended into an angry tit for tat, with accusations of twists and distortions, ever since Mr. Obama began accusing Mr. Romney of shipping American jobs overseas while in the private sector — a message that appears to be resonating among some swing-state voters. Mr. Romney, after a long weekend off the campaign trail, came roaring back by accusing the president of “crony capitalism.” He cited Fisker Automotive, which received up to $529 million in federal loan guarantees in 2009 to develop hybrid electric cars , some of which were made in Finland, although the Obama administration says the federal money did not go overseas. Among the company’s investors is a venture-capital firm whose partners include John Doerr, a major donor to the president. “I’m ashamed to say we’re seeing our president hand out money to the businesses of campaign contributors,” Mr. Romney said here in Irwin. But the impact of Mr. Romney’s attack was somewhat blunted by distractions from prominent Republicans. First, Representative Ron Paul of Texas called on Mr. Romney to release more of his tax returns, an appeal echoed by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and National Review , the prominent conservative publication. More troublesome, John H. Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor and a stalwart surrogate for Mr. Romney, had to retract a comment after saying Tuesday, “I wish this president would learn how to be an American.” Mr. Sununu, speaking during a press call, recognized the gaffe and rephrased his remark during the same call: “What I thought I said, but what I didn’t say, is the president has to learn the American formula for creating business.” He apologized later on CNN, saying: “Frankly, I made a mistake. I shouldn’t have used those words.” The off-message moments blew a bit of fog over what the Romney campaign had intended to be a coordinated series of sharp attacks on Mr. Obama over free enterprise. Mr. Romney returned to the trail in Pennsylvania with his campaign struggling to regain its footing after several days of withering attacks from the Obama camp about his tenure at Bain Capital and demands that he release more tax returns to illuminate the extent of his investments in offshore accounts. At a company that provides services to oil and gas drillers here, Mr. Romney criticized Mr. Obama for suggesting that entrepreneurs owe their success partly to government investments in education and infrastructure. “The idea to say that Steve Jobs didn’t build Apple, that Henry Ford didn’t build Ford Motor, that Papa John didn’t build Papa John’s Pizza,” he said, “it is not just foolishness. It’s insulting to every entrepreneur, every innovator in America, and it’s wrong.” “I find it extraordinary that a philosophy of that nature would be spoken by a president of the United States,” he added. While Mr. Romney was in Pennsylvania, Mr. Obama was in Texas, where he found himself laying out contrasting economic philosophies with another Republican, former President George W. Bush . Mr. Obama had flown to Mr. Bush’s home state to headline four campaign fund-raisers and, in the process, warn the country against returning to the policies of his predecessor. Mr. Bush separately unveiled a book outlining ideas for reinvigorating an economy that has sputtered along under his successor. The divergent messages were more an accident of geography and happenstance than a result of planning. Aides to each man said his schedule had been set without knowledge of the other’s. But the proximity and timing brought into sharp relief the choices facing the country in this fall’s election on polarizing issues like taxes, jobs, growth, regulation and free enterprise. At the first of four fund-raisers in San Antonio and Austin, Mr. Obama told 1,200 supporters that Republicans, led by Mr. Romney, wanted to return to policies that had led to the economic troubles confronting his presidency. “We spent almost a decade doing what they prescribed,” Mr. Obama said. “And how did it turn out? We didn’t see greater job growth. We didn’t see middle-class security. We saw the opposite. And it all culminated in the worst financial crisis in our lifetimes, precisely because there were no regulations that were adequate to the kinds of recklessness that was being carried out.” He added: “I don’t know how you guys operate in your life. But my general rule is if I do something and it doesn’t work, I don’t go back to doing it.” The message was similar to one in most of his campaign speeches, but delivering it in Texas highlighted the person he blames. Hours later, Mr. Bush released “The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs,” a book of essays by economists, including five Nobel Prize winners, offering free-market ideas to spur the economy. “We’ll never fix the deficit without growing the private sector,” he told a crowd of supporters before some of the economists presented their ideas. Mr. Bush wrote the foreword and offered no assessment of Mr. Obama’s record, in keeping with his post-White House practice of not commenting on his successor. The underlying thrust of the book, though, is the notion that the economy has not been repaired in the three and a half years since Mr. Obama took over, and that more robust actions are needed. The former president proposed a goal of sustained 4 percent annual growth, which would be ambitious for a country whose growth has averaged just over 3 percent a year since 1948 and is currently below 2 percent. “We’re an economy in transition,” Brendan Miniter, who edited Mr. Bush’s book, said in an interview earlier in the day. “If we don’t set the target higher, if we just continue to stumble along, ultimately we’re going to pay a pretty stark price.”",

    "source": "Tennessee: Five Deaths Under Investigation <eos> The deaths of three women and a toddler in southern Tennessee may be related to a body found just across the state line in Alabama, the authorities said Tuesday. On Monday, three women and an 18-month-old boy were found dead at two homes in Lincoln County, about 100 miles south of Nashville. A body found in Alabama on Tuesday may be that of Warren V. Crutcher, who had been sought for questioning, said Craig Whisenant, the Madison County coroner. Mr. Whisenant said the man did not commit suicide. Sheriff Murray Blackwelder of Lincoln County said two children survived the attacks, and he identified one of them as Mr. Crutcher’s 3-year-old son. The cause of the deaths has not been released, and the bodies were sent for autopsies. The investigation began when the 3-year-old called relatives saying he could not wake up anyone at his house, said his godmother, Constance Winston. Found dead in the home were his mother, Chabreya Campbell, 22; and her son Rico Ragland, 18 months; and Amber McCaulley, 21. Hours later, the body of Jessica Brown, 21, was found in her home in Fayetteville, Tenn. Her 2-month-old child was found in the home unharmed.",

    "source": "Chipotle Will Close Stores for Food Safety Meetings After Outbreaks <eos> As Chipotle Mexican Grill tries to recover from a series of contaminations that have caused some customers and investors to flee, it said it would shut all its stores for several hours on Feb. 8 to hold food safety meetings with employees. “We are hosting a national team meeting to thank our employees for their hard work through this difficult time, discuss some of the food safety changes we are implementing, and answer questions from employees,” Chris Arnold, a Chipotle spokesman, said in an email. The stores will open at 3 p.m., later than the usual start time of about 10 a.m. or 11 a.m., skipping the lunch hour rush on a Monday. The restaurant chain, which has more than 2,000 locations and has created an identity based largely on using locally grown, fresh ingredients, has been contending with a series of E. coli outbreaks . Five customers in Seattle became ill with the bacteria in July, and there have been at least six outbreaks in the last six months. Chipotle indicated last week that the federal authorities were pursuing a criminal case . The company said it had received a grand jury subpoena related to a norovirus outbreak that sickened 234 people in Simi Valley, Calif., in August. Chipotle has said that outbreak and another in Boston that affected at least 136 customers in December were caused by sick employees who ignored company policies that prohibited them from working. More than 500 people are estimated to have become ill after eating in Chipotle restaurants in the second half of 2015. The company said in December that it may never know what caused an E. coli outbreak in November linked to two restaurants in Kansas and Oklahoma. “If there’s a silver lining in this, it is that by not knowing for sure what the cause is, it’s prompted us to look at every ingredient we use with an eye to improving our practices,” Mr. Arnold said this week . “We did a really comprehensive review of food safety practices from farm to restaurants,” he added. “From that assessment we developed a food safety plan, which we hope will establish Chipotle as a leader in food safety.” Chipotle’s same-store sales dropped by 14.6 percent in the last quarter.",

    "source": "Bail Denied in Case of Giving Software to Qaeda <eos> A federal magistrate judge in Manhattan refused on Monday to grant bail to a former Brooklyn resident charged with conspiring to provide Al Qaeda with computer advice and other assistance, finding that the man was dangerous and might flee. The ruling came after prosecutors said the defendant, Sabirhan Hasanoff, a dual citizen of the United States and Australia, had sworn an oath of allegiance to Al Qaeda and conspired to provide the group with money and software for encrypted communications over the Internet. Mr. Hasanoff, who had recently worked in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, had also tried unsuccessfully to travel to Iraq “hoping to be able to fight in the jihad,” a federal prosecutor, John P. Cronan, told the judge. “He knew full well of the objectives of Al Qaeda,” Mr. Cronan said. “He embraced its extremist ideology and radical goals. And when given the opportunity, he jumped at the chance of joining the organization.” When the charges against Mr. Hasanoff and a co-defendant were announced last month, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the two men had “conspired to modernize Al Qaeda” with computer systems expertise and other services. On Monday, the prosecutor, Mr. Cronan, cited what he called the men’s technological sophistication, wealth and “ability to move money easily” as some of the “many reasons why these two individuals were so attractive to Al Qaeda.” He noted that Mr. Hasanoff owned a house worth about $750,000. Mr. Hasanoff has an accounting degree from Baruch College, and most recently worked as a group chief financial officer for a company in Dubai, his lawyer, Anthony L. Ricco, said in court. Mr. Cronan, said the evidence against Mr. Hasanoff included a government witness “who can tell the entire story” and significant corroboration. Mr. Hasanoff pleaded not guilty; if convicted, he could face a prison sentence of 15 years. His lawyer, Mr. Ricco, asked the judge, James C. Francis IV, to release his client on $2 million bond and a condition of home detention. “Whatever value for the sake of argument that he is to Al Qaeda because he can travel and because he has financial resources, that no longer exists,” Mr. Ricco said. He said 15 people, all professionals, were willing to sign the bond on his client’s behalf. But Judge Francis refused to release Mr. Hasanoff, citing his computer skills and financial acumen. He also said that Mr. Hasanoff “may be motivated by strong ideological considerations,” which might give him incentive to flee. “The evidence against the defendant appears to be relatively strong,” the judge said. After the proceeding, Mr. Ricco said he planned to appeal the ruling to a federal district judge. “This was not unexpected,” he said. “We haven’t seen a defendant like him in the Southern District before, charged with providing material assistance. He’s a successful businessman.” Both Mr. Hasanoff and his co-defendant, whom prosecutors identified as Wesam El-Hanafi, were arrested in Dubai last month and brought back to the United States to face charges.",

    "source": "Critics Exploit Télécom Suicides, Ex-Executive Says <eos> PARIS — Outsiders have taken advantage of the wave of suicides at France Télécom to push their own agenda, a former top executive at the company said in an interview posted Wednesday on a Web site. At least 46 France Télécom employees have committed suicide since January 2008, according to the company, including 11 this year. Unions have pointed to relentless reorganizations and cost-cutting as the cause. “That somebody ends his life is really something which makes me feel very, very bad,” Louis-Pierre Wenes, France Télécom’s former deputy chief executive, said in the interview, his first since he stepped down under pressure last fall. But looking in isolation at the suicide rate in recent years gives “a biased view of the situation,” Mr. Wenes added. The rate was actually higher in 2000, he said, “and moreover, the rate was absolutely similar to the overall French corresponding population.” The World Health Organization estimated the suicide rate in France in 2005 at 26.4 per 100,000 for men and 9.2 for women. — France Télécom employs about 102,000 people in France. In the interview, conducted in English and posted on MeetTheBoss.TV, Mr. Wenes said the employee suicides had seized public attention “because a certain number of external stakeholders had their personal agenda, and it’s always very easy to play on the emotion of the people.” Mr. Wenes did not identify the “external stakeholders” and could not immediately be reached for comment. In addition to causing a wave of bad publicity last fall, the suicides prompted President Nicolas Sarkozy’s government to intervene. Mr. Wenes, a principal architect of the company’s reorganization efforts and a lightning rod for criticism, was shuffled out in October to make room for Stéphane Richard. Employees greeted news of the departure of Mr. Wenes with satisfaction, with the newsmagazine Le Point quoting one union official, Sébastien Crozier, as saying at the time that it was an “indispensable element of the restructuring of France Télécom.” Mr. Richard rose to chief executive on March 1, taking over from Didier Lombard at the former state monopoly, in which civil servants with lifetime job guarantees make up a majority of the work force. Mr. Richard is now working to restore order and morale while remaining focused on the rapidly changing telecommunications market. The government retains a stake of about 27 percent in the company. Technologia, a human resources consulting firm hired to help advise France Télécom on the suicides, recommended in early March that the company halt reorganizations, closely monitor psychosocial risk factors and create an internal network of mediators to improve communication. The company has already begun to act on some of those recommendations. Worse could still be ahead for the company. On March 17, Jean-Christophe Vaulot-Pfister, a deputy prosecutor in Besançon, in eastern France, said he had ordered a judge to look into the suicide of a young employee of the company, who had apparently been distraught about his job, to decide whether France Télécom should be charged with manslaughter. Mr. Vaulot-Pfister declined on Wednesday to comment on the investigation. Jean-Bernard Orsoni, a France Télécom spokesman, also declined to comment on the investigation, or on the interview with Mr. Wenes. As for the company’s efforts to improve morale, he said, “we’re in a rebuilding phase right now.”",

    "source": "Cancellation Clears Path for Hirscher <eos> LENZERHEIDE, SWITZERLAND — What first looked to be a thrilling down-to-the-wire finale this weekend in alpine ski racing will mostly be a victory salute for Marcel Hirscher, the 24-year-old Austrian who will receive his second consecutive large crystal globe as overall World Cup champion after the season-ending slalom Sunday. Hirscher entered the weekend technical races at the World Cup finals with a 149-point advantage over his nearest challenger, Aksel Lund Svindal. That margin became insurmountable when the Norwegian announced that he would forgo the slalom after cancellation of downhill and super-G races Wednesday and Thursday because of adverse weather conditions. Svindal garnered the downhill and super-G titles after a cancellation Wednesday because of thick fog and then a controversial race Thursday that culminated in the crash of the Austrian skier Klaus Kröll. The crash occurred in gusting winds and questionable racing conditions and resulted in the cancellation of the rest of the races Thursday. That cost Svindal an opportunity to gain valuable points, because the rules state that in World Cup finals, races are not re-scheduled. “It’s mixed emotions, because on one side it’s been a great year and I’m very happy, but on the other side, I would have liked to give Hirscher a fight to the end,” Svindal said after the super-G was canceled. “I see no point in competing in the slalom now,” said Svindal, whose best career finish in the discipline is sixth. “It might have been a consideration, had the two last races not been canceled.” Svindal, who won overall titles in 2007 and 2009 and became the first Norwegian downhill cup champion since Lasse Kjus in 1999, praised Hirscher. “Marcel Hirscher fully deserves his second big cup. He has achieved an amazing season,” Svindal said. “I am also very pleased with my own winter. I’ve reached a lot with my gold medal at Schladming and my two crystal globes in the speed events,” he said referring to his downhill world championship in Austria in February, and his downhill and super-G titles. Hirscher, who wrapped up the slalom title last weekend in Slovenia, has seven victories this season having finished among the top three in 16 of 18 races. He will join fellow Austrian ski legends Karl Schranz and Stephan Eberharter with two overall World Cup titles. Following the cancellation of men’s and women’s speed events Wednesday and Thursday, an improved weather forecast was expected for giant slalom and slalom races Saturday and Sunday. In just one of the four remaining races — the women’s slalom Saturday — is a season title yet to be determined. The Slovenian Tina Maze — who clinched her first overall title February 24 in Méribel, France — can add a slalom title to her dominant season if she maintains a seven-point lead over the American Mikaela Shiffrin in a slalom Saturday. Maze, 29, regained the slalom lead over Shiffrin, who celebrated her 18th birthday Wednesday, with a victory in Ofterschwang, Germany last Sunday. On Feb. 16, Shiffrin became the youngest women’s world slalom champion in 39 years. If Shiffrin can either win the slalom or overcome the seven-point deficit, she will be the first American to win a slalom title since Tamara McKinney in 1984. “I’ll just go as hard as I can and see if I can get it back,” Shiffrin said, referring to relinquishing the slalom points lead. “If not, I’ve still had an amazing season, so I can’t be disappointed. Yeah, I want the globe, but we’ll see if it works out that way. Tina has had an amazing season and she just keeps going, so that’s really cool and inspiring.” Maze has accumulated an unprecedented 2,254 World Cup points this season and can increase that total Saturday and Sunday. She also has 22 podium finishes this season and will pass the Austrian Hermann Maier, who accomplished the feat in 1999-2000, if she finishes among the top three in either race this weekend. If Maze hangs on to her slalom points advantage, she will earn her fourth crystal globe this season: the overall and three discipline titles. Maze also took the combined title, with two victories in two races, although a crystal globe is no longer awarded in the discipline. As a result of the tumultuous week of fog, occasional heavy snowfall and high winds in Lenzerheide, Maze locked up the super-G title Thursday when the women’s race was wiped out. However she lost a chance at the downhill crown — she trailed the injured American Lindsey Vonn by only one point — with the forfeiture of the downhill Wednesday. “I don’t really like these kind of days when you don’t get the chance to show your skills on the slope,” said Maze, after the super-G cancellation Thursday. “But in the end, today is a good day for me, while yesterday wasn’t. Of course, I’m happy to secure the super-G title. I’m really proud of my season.” Maze, who captured the giant slalom title in late January, will be the favorite in the final women’s G.S. race of the season Sunday. Ted Ligety, who won his fourth giant slalom globe this season, has been nearly unbeatable and will seek his seventh victory in nine races Saturday. The U.S. racer is also on track to finish third in the overall standings behind Hirscher and Svindal. On Sunday, Hirscher will attempt to finish in style, trying for his ninth consecutive slalom podium. Much like two years ago, when four important races were also canceled because of poor weather in Lenzerheide — and Maria Höfl-Riesch was handed the overall title after finishing three points ahead of Vonn — it has been another troublesome week at the Swiss resort for International Ski Federation race organizers. With the bottom of the Silvano Beltrametti racecourse shrouded in fog, start times for the men’s and women’s downhill Wednesday were pushed back eight times during nearly five hours of delays before the cancellations. On Thursday, the men’s super-G began more than three hours late, and after nine racers battled through persistent crosswinds on the mountain, Kröll lost control and crashed into the safety netting. The 2012 downhill champion was flown by helicopter to a nearby hospital. He was said to have had surgery to set a fractured left arm. Both men’s and women’s races were canceled about forty minutes after the incident.",

    "source": "Mexican Official Defends Accuracy of Data on Organized Crime <eos> MEXICO CITY — Rejecting concerns that the government’s statistics were foggier than ever, Mexico’s top security official argued Friday that real progress was being made in reducing organized crime killings and that the number of people previously reported missing was inflated. The official, Interior Secretary Miguel Osorio Chong, summoned foreign reporters for a briefing and, while discussing several topics, pushed back against suggestions that the administration was more focused on controlling its message than on the truth when it released statistics. “We are never going to link security to politics,” he said. In the nearly six months since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office, Mr. Osorio Chong said, the smarter use of intelligence and efforts to avoid violent confrontations between federal forces and criminal gangs have led to a nearly 20 percent drop in organized crime killings. So far this year, the average number of such killings has been 34 a day, compared with 41 a day last year, according to a document he let reporters see but not copy or photograph because the numbers were preliminary. Regarding disappearances, he said further investigation would show that a database begun in the previous administration and consisting of 26,000 missing-person cases in the past six years would shrink, because many of the cases involved people who had migrated to other places or left home for reasons unrelated to organized crime or drug activity. Image Interior Minister Miguel Osorio Chong, left, with Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam, stood by official statistics. Credit Henry Romero/Reuters Family members of the disappeared in recent weeks have stepped up their calls for the government to investigate the cases. Tracking progress in the drug war has always proved difficult, with large numbers of crimes that go unreported, uninvestigated and unsolved. Independent analysts in recent weeks have questioned the government’s collection methods and complained that little effort is being made to strengthen the local and state police agencies charged with doing the bulk of investigating and that they are still falling short. Writing for the Insight Crime blog, Alejandro Hope, a security analyst and a former Mexican intelligence officer, called into question efforts to classify cases as related to organized crime, since little investigation is done to prove such motives and the criteria are subjective and open to manipulation. Mr. Hope noted that the overall number of homicides had increased in the first months of the administration. “Murders ‘unrelated’ to drug trafficking went up in the first four months of the current administration, according to Mexican government figures — but does this really mean that the narcos are killing less, while all other forms of violence are growing?” he asked. This week the newsweekly ZETA released its own analysis surveying state authorities and other data and found the number of organized crime homicides far higher than what the government had reported. It also found that other crimes, like kidnappings, were on the rise. The previous government under Felipe Calderón abandoned the practice of releasing statistics related to organized crime, with officials saying that the tallies were imprecise and difficult to verify.",

    "source": "Importing Chiefs, Detroit Reflects on Its ‘Car Guys’ <eos> DETROIT, Aug. 12 — Where have all the car guys gone? With the surprise appointment last week of Robert L. Nardelli, the former Home Depot chief executive, to run Chrysler, Detroit has completed a new-model changeover of the executive suite. It is no longer a requirement to have “motor oil in your veins,” as they are fond of saying in this city, to run a car company. None of the chiefs now leading the three American car companies can be credited for inspiring or developing anything on the roads today — the unofficial definition of what makes a Detroit chief executive a true “car guy.” Only one of them, Rick Wagoner at General Motors , has more than a year of experience in the industry. Moreover, very few of their highest-ranking colleagues have come up through the design, engineering or marketing side of the business so vital to Detroit’s existence. It is a sharp break from a tradition stretching back to the industry’s infancy, when car builders became chiefs of the companies that bore their names. As recently as last decade, all three chief executives could brag about cars they had helped develop. Ford ’s chief at the time, Donald E. Petersen, oversaw the Ford Taurus and earlier Fords. At G.M., Robert C. Stempel engineered several vehicles, including the Oldsmobile Toronado. And the most famous car guy of the time, Lee A. Iacocca, was credited with the success of Chrysler’s K-cars and its minivan (and the Mustang from a previous stint at Ford). As a marketing expert, though, he admittedly had others doing the actual development work. But people in some quarters now argue that an outsider’s pragmatic eye may be worth more than the gut instincts that come from bringing a car to life. Given that the Detroit automakers have lost billions of dollars, and market share, to Japanese competitors in recent years, the evidence may be on their side. Though car guys were responsible for Detroit’s triumphs, they also steered the companies into trouble with errors in judgment that included relying too heavily on big sport-utility vehicles. “This is a business that needs to be run as a business,” Alan R. Mulally, Ford’s chief executive, said at an industry conference last week near Traverse City, Mich. Even the now-retired Mr. Petersen, in a rare interview, agreed with that. “I think the concept’s been overdone,” he said last week of the car-guy mystique. By insisting that only homegrown talent be promoted, Mr. Petersen added, “it’s undervaluing the inherent knowledge that you get about how things do in fact work in a very complex industrial setting.” The appointment a year ago of Mr. Mulally, a former president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, marked the first time an outsider had been appointed to run an auto company in Detroit, where lengthy careers at a single company are still the norm. Mr. Wagoner, for example, joined G.M. 30 years ago, and rose to chief financial officer in 1992 at age 39. By contrast, Mr. Nardelli has barely finished his first week as an automobile executive. His appointment has led to a kind of town hall discussion in the industry — in union halls, on Internet message boards and at an industry conference last week in northern Michigan — about who is best equipped to lead the industry out of its current troubles. The Detroit News asked readers to share their thoughts at its Web site after Mr. Nardelli’s appointment, and they had wide-ranging opinions about Chrysler’s future under its new owner, Cerberus Capital Management. “The whole industry has to stop pointing fingers at the rest of the world and instead decide what they can do,” said another reader from Troy, Mich. “It’s their industry. If they don’t fix it, it’s their jobs that go away.” Another was less confident in the new boss: “I’m terrified by what Nardelli and Cerberus could do to Chrysler.” Mr. Nardelli hoped to win over some skeptics about his background when he stressed his love for Chrysler products last Monday at a news conference — he said his garage included a Jeep, a Plymouth Prowler and a PT Cruiser. But Edward Lapham, executive editor of Automotive News, a trade publication, wrote on Wednesday that it would be a mistake for Mr. Nardelli “to assume that just because he likes cars, he’s a car guy.” Arturo Reyes, the president of United Automobile Workers Local 651 in Flint, Mich., said he was skeptical of Mr. Nardelli. “I get more excited about the prospect of a company when we’re talking about a car guy who has seen the manufacturing process, who knows the design team, who can talk about quality and everything else,” Mr. Reyes said. To be sure, there is not a car guy in charge at the world’s biggest car company, Toyota Motor, which passed G.M. earlier this year to take the No. 1 spot. In fact, it is difficult to name a traditional car guy at Toyota beyond the company’s founder, Kiichiro Toyoda, who acknowledged copying a Chevrolet design for Toyota’s first car, the AA, in 1936. Toyota’s top executives typically have a broad background, not a single expertise. Its current chief executive, Katsuaki Watanabe, is an economist and purchasing expert. The company’s emphasis on consensus also means an expert’s voice is only one of many when decisions are made, said James Lentz, an executive vice president at Toyota Motor Sales USA. “The days of just a car guy running with their gut feeling probably are, today, pretty difficult to do,” Mr. Lentz said. Robert A. Lutz, vice chairman of G.M., is perhaps the Detroit executive best known for a “golden gut” that led him to direct the development of vehicles like the 10-cylinder Dodge Viper sports car. He said last week that he was not opposed to the idea of industry outsiders at the top. “What you need is a well-balanced individual who has a lot of experience in the business, who has a brilliant business mind and knows what he or she doesn’t know,” he said at the automotive conference. “If a person from the outside incorporates all those things, then there’s no reason why he or she wouldn’t do well.” But Mr. Lutz cautioned that Mr. Nardelli, reportedly hired to speed Chrysler’s turnaround from $1.5 billion in losses last year, should not expect quick results. “If anyone thinks they’re going to get all that solved in three months, I wish them a lot of luck,” he said. A car guy’s background is invaluable in one sense, Mr. Petersen said. In an industry so focused on trying to predict trends, executives benefit from having both their own knowledge about the industry and experience in reading what other car guys are telling them. “Unless you know the business, you won’t know what can and can’t be done,” Mr. Petersen said. With a car background, “you have the basic ability to be able to challenge.” To Mr. Petersen, the debate over non-car guys reminds him of an earlier trend, when companies scurried to elevate their chief financial officers, believing that familiarity with Wall Street trumped operating know-how. For Detroit, Mr. Nardelli’s appointment will be “a very interesting experiment,” he said.",

    "source": "Paradise in a Pit Stop for Cabbies in Queens <eos> In a corner of Long Island City known for beat-up auto repair shops and street-side chicken vendors, the newly renovated building that is home to Queens Medallion Brokerage looms like a checkered-yellow palace. At its simplest, it is a taxi garage where drivers come to pay their weekly medallion dues and rant about the afternoon’s snooty tourists. But step away from the teller’s line and cabbies enter — by garage standards, anyway — a luxury suite: plasma TVs hanging from the walls, private showers next to the mechanics’ floor and soon (the bosses promise), a trio of massage chairs for the lounge. “You’ll never see anything like this,” said Tony Georgiton, a former cabdriver and vice president of the medallion company, as he led a tour of the building on a recent weekday. “Nowhere else.” Mr. Georgiton and the company’s president, Basil Messados, were used to shabby, single-bathroom garages where grease lined the walls and drivers had to step over transmission parts just to talk to one another. Now, they have created a taxi driver’s paradise, a refuge totally unlike the grimy, disheveled hangouts popularized on screen. On a shelf in Mr. Messados’s office, next to photos of his wife and father, sits a portrait of a huffing-and-puffing Robert De Niro from the classic movie “Taxi Driver.” Mr. Messados said that he understood the plight of the hack. In the 1980s, he drove a cab from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. for a weekly income of $152. Since then, he has traded in his yellow Ford LTD for a white Mercedes roadster. But he has not forgotten the long and erratic hours, the constant compliance checks from the city, and the sometimes ill-mannered customers. (Don’t get him started on the customers.) The 32,000-square-foot building in Queens, which opened in April, is intended to alleviate some of those pressures, he said, and add a bit of comfort to what can be a grueling way of life. “A driver needs an island, an oasis, where he can get away and feel like a human,” Mr. Messados said, putting out a cigarette in an ashtray painted to look like an old-fashioned Checker cab. “I think it’s a big shock when you tell them they can take a shower.” Mr. Georgiton, 50, and Mr. Messados, 41, both Greek immigrants, retain a youthful energy that fuels off-color jokes and threats to tear the replica Greek sword off the wall for a lunchtime duel. The two have been business partners for nearly two decades, having set up shop in 1991 with a nine-cab brokerage in Queens. They currently lease medallions for about 400 cabs, with two or three drivers using each car. Each driver pays about $800 a week to use the medallion, and some pay more for insurance or to finance their cabs if they do not own them. The garage operates in a 91-year-old former factory that was bought in March for $6.5 million. An additional $1.5 million was spent to turn it into a sparkling, mustard-colored headquarters. It was a decided upgrade from the company’s old building a few blocks away. “Someone told me once that you die without pockets — you can’t take anything with you,” Mr. Georgiton said. “We cut down on our profits a little, but you feel good about yourself.” Many drivers seem to feel pretty good about the new place, too — when they can make use of it. Queens Medallion has not yet secured permission from the city to run a taxi stand, so cabbies can usually enjoy five or 10 minutes in the lunchroom before parking tickets start to hit windshields in the no-parking zone outside. Drivers stream in and out all day, staying long enough to grab a Coke from the vending machine or catch a few minutes of a soccer game broadcast in high definition. While the lunchroom is popular, the showers rarely flow. Last week, drivers were in and out at lightning speed. Sheik Musa Samory dashed into the lunchroom and spread out his maroon prayer mat. Mr. Musa Samory, who used to pray in a cramped room in the old location, said that when he first saw the new facilities, “it was like we were on the moon.” He said the renovations reflected the caring attitude of the owners, who are known to organize weekly soccer matches and chat amiably with drivers in the lounge. “This is the way a business place should be,” said Mr. Musa Samory, a native of Ghana and a cabdriver since 1979. “Not just for money, but concern for health and to help you be happy.” But in a time of dreary economic forecasts, others are not so pleased. Chantal Goin questioned the need for fancy facilities when many taxi drivers are struggling to earn enough to pay for expensive gas. “Why put a shower in?” Ms. Goin shouted on the way to her cab. “It doesn’t make a difference. All I do is come in here and pay and leave.” Hamidou Barry, an immigrant from Mali, said he would have preferred that the money used for renovations go instead toward reducing fees for taxi drivers, like the charge drivers must pay to share a cab. Mr. Barry said he was considering leaving the brokerage because it was getting too expensive. “This place is good, but they’re doing something that’s not right,” he said. “Charge, charge, charge, charge, charge.” Mr. Messados defended the costs, explaining that having multiple drivers share one cab required extra insurance fees. And amid all the frills, there are those who miss the filth. “It’s very nice, said Rashad Javaid, 29, from Pakistan. “Almost too nice.” Mementos of a not-so-luxurious past have not totally vanished. Wander past the TV screens, up the granite staircase, and through the stately bathroom doors. A sign above the shimmering new toilets gently reminds drivers: “Please Flush Toilet by Hand Only. Do Not Kick to Flush!!!”",

    "source": "South Korea’s Golf Dominance Leaves Some of the World’s Best Out of the Olympics <eos> SAN MARTIN, Calif. — They have been tracking results week after week as compulsively as players in a fantasy league do. In South Korea, where people are passionate about women’s golf and the Olympics, the composition of the team that the country will send to the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro next month has drawn intense scrutiny. “Every single week we talk about who is going to be playing, how they’re going to prepare and they talk about the gold medal,” said Se Ri Pak, who will serve as the captain of the South Korean women’s Olympic squad. She added, “Our country is taking it really, really seriously.” Image Amy Yang, ranked No. 9 in the world, finished in a tie for third at the United States Women’s Open. Credit Elaine Thompson/Associated Press In women’s golf, South Korea is like a cribbage player who has to slough off cards from a strong hand. In the current world rankings, the country boasts seven of the top 14 players, and 10 of the top 20. The Olympic qualification standards dictate that every player in the top 15 is eligible to compete but no country can have more than four representatives in the 60-player field. The women representing South Korea will be a Dream Team, with a group so formidable there likely will be no place for Ha-na Jang, who began the week ranked 10th in the world. Monday is the cutoff for qualification, which turned the United States Women’s Open at CordeValle Golf Club into a last-ditch effort to qualify for the Olympics for a group of South Koreans that included Jang, ninth-ranked Amy Yang, 11th-ranked So Yeon Ryu, 14th-ranked Bo-mee Lee and 18th-ranked Sung-hyun Park. Sung-hyun Park insinuated herself into the race by holding at least a share of the lead on the back nine Sunday. A victory would have moved Park, 22, to 10th in the world rankings, bumping her compatriot, Jang, for the first-alternate spot for the Olympics. Imagine the pressure of trying to become the seventh South Korean in the past nine years to win the United States Women’s Open while also simultaneously trying to nail down a possible spot in golf’s return to the Olympics after a 112-year absence. It was too much for Park, who played the last seven holes in two-over to finish tied for third. “To be honest it’s definitely stressful,” said Ryu, the 2011 United States Women’s Open champion who tried and failed on both fronts. She closed with a 69, her best score of the week, to finish tied for 10th, not high enough to earn a berth to Rio. Image So Yeon Ryu’s No. 11 ranking made her only the sixth-best South Korean golfer. Credit Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images “You don’t really want to predict something in the future, you just want to focus on the present,” Ryu said. “But when people keep saying, ‘Oh, So Yeon, you’re so close,’ when people keep saying that I cannot focus on my game. That was really the tough part.” The top-ranked South Korean, Inbee Park, who is No. 3 overall, did not compete this week because of a lingering left thumb injury. If she is unable to play in Rio, Jang will take her place. But Ryu does not believe the injury will sideline her good friend. Asked if she expects Park to play in Rio, Ryu replied, “Yeah, for sure, it’s such an honor.” The Olympic team picture became more blurred as the week wore on. Another player, In-gee Chun, who has five top 3 finishes this year, including a runner-up at the ANA Inspiration, was the third-ranked South Korean, at sixth overall. But she missed the cut here, cracking the door open for those behind them in the rankings to slip through. Image Sung-hyun Park joined Amy Yang in a tie for third place at the United States Women’s Open. Credit Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images Lurking near the lead on Sunday, as has become her custom in the majors, was Yang, the fourth-ranked Korean who recorded her 14th career top-10 finish in a major, a tie for third. Earlier in the year, Yang said she was constantly being asked about her Olympic prospects. Her play suffered, she explained, because the questions took her focus off the present. “So I quit thinking about it,” she said. “If I get a chance, it’d be great. If I don’t, I get some time off.” The challenge of blocking out the Olympics came into clearer focus after Yang posted a 73 on Saturday to sit two strokes out of the 54-hole lead. One of the first questions she fielded was about the Olympics. Yang was asked which would mean more to her: a United States Open victory or an Olympic gold medal. Image Bo-mee Lee was one of several South Korean golfers trying to earn a spot on the country’s Olympic team by winning the United States Women’s Open. Credit Atsushi Tomura/Getty Images “It’s hard to decide,” she said. On Sunday, after finishing tied for third at four under, Yang celebrated her consolation prize: a trip to Rio. “That’s amazing,” she said, adding, “I told everyone I’m relaxing about making the team but one side of me was fighting it, like ‘I want it’ and another side was saying ‘let it go.’” It’s hard to explain an Olympic qualification system that leaves out the Nos. 11, 14 and 18 in the world but includes the Indian teenager, Aditi Ashok, who is ranked 441st. But that is the scenario the South Koreans were left to digest. And it could have been grimmer for the South Koreans if the world No. 1, Lydia Ko, who was born in Seoul, had not moved with her family to New Zealand when she was young. Ko, 19, was an interested bystander to the jockeying among the players from the country of her birth. “It’s so close,” she said, adding, “It’s really hard to choose which player deserves to be going because at the end of the day they all deserve to be representing their country.” With the finalization on Monday of the Olympic golf team rosters, the scrutiny of the South Korean women will shift to the possibility of a podium sweep. “A lot of Korean people for sure think we’re going to make the gold medal and all the medals,” Ryu said, adding, “But you cannot predict anything about golf.”",

    "source": "Late Seahawks Drive Ends With a Screeching Halt After a Risky Call <eos> GLENDALE, Ariz. — On the same field where a receiver named David Tyree had improbably caught a desperation throw to propel the Giants to Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots seven years earlier, the Seattle Seahawks had a potentially historic acrobatic catch of their own to remember and treasure. The difference in the falling reception by Jermaine Kearse, however, is that the Seahawks did not complete the drive into the end zone. The highlight was almost immediately trumped by a highly questionable play call, an interception at the goal line and a brawl, all more unbelievable than the catch that had preceded them. “A very, very hard lesson,” Seattle Coach Pete Carroll said, noting that his team had been on the verge of another championship. “I hate to learn the hard way, but there’s no other way to look at it right now.” Seattle had blown a 10-point fourth-quarter lead but found itself at New England’s 38-yard line with 1 minute 14 seconds left. Trailing by 28-24, quarterback Russell Wilson lobbed a pass down the right side to receiver Kearse, who was blanketed by the backup cornerback Malcolm Butler. Both men leapt over the 10-yard line, falling backward like high-jumpers over a bar, as the ball was volleyed into the air while they skidded backward on the grass. The ball dropped into the arms of Kearse, who cradled it for a catch as dramatic as any in Super Bowl history. Image Tom Brady throwing during the first half of Super Bowl XLIX at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz. Brady won his fourth Super Bowl. 1 / 24 The Seahawks had a first down at the 5-yard line and used the second of their three timeouts with 1:06 left. Wilson handed off to the bruising back Marshawn Lynch, who gained 4 yards, nearly dragging defenders into the end zone. Carroll, his usual state of calm lost in emotion that seemed balanced between anger and disappointment, said after the game that he had not wanted to “waste” a running play and thought a quick pass would be the game-winner. The offensive coordinator, Darrell Bevell, made the play call, but Carroll gave it the go-ahead without debate. “It’s not the right matchup for us to run the football, so on second down, we throw the ball, really to kind of waste that play,” Carroll said. “If we score, we do. If we don’t, then we’ll run it on third and fourth down.” He said he had looked at Wilson, his third-year quarterback, before the play to make sure that Wilson understood the gravity of the moment. He did. With the clock ticking, on second-and-goal at the 1-yard line, Wilson took the snap from the shotgun position. He threw immediately to the goal line, toward receiver Ricardo Lockette. But Butler and the ball arrived at the same time, and Butler snagged the prize: a game-clinching interception. “I put the blame on me,” said Wilson, who did not question the call when he received it. “I’m the one who threw it.” The interception immediately set off a debate over Seattle’s play-calling and, shortly after, a fight that escalated momentarily out of control in the end zone. The Seahawks had one timeout remaining and Lynch — the league’s leading bulldozer, with more rushing yards and touchdowns than anyone over the past four seasons — ready to plunge in for the winning score. Video The Seattle Seahawks coach spoke about the interception that cost his team the game. Credit Credit Matt York/Associated Press Instead of Kearse becoming the hero, it was the little-known Butler, who had been the foil to Kearse moments before he saved the game for New England with an interception. “I’ve worked so hard in practice, and I just wanted to play so bad and help my team out,” Butler said afterward. “I got out there and did exactly what I needed to do to help my team win.” With the expected Seahawks victory ripped away unexpectedly, Seattle’s emotions came unhinged. The New England offense took the field for the final snaps. With 20 seconds left, after Seattle had been penalized five yards for encroachment, New England quarterback Tom Brady took a knee. A fight broke out, centered around Seattle linebacker Bruce Irvin, who rampaged through the end zone looking for Patriots to engage. For a few seconds, as officials tried to gain control, it looked as if the fighting might spread. “It was just frustration between two teams,” said Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, who had been in the middle of the scrum. “It’s football.” Irvin was ejected, Brady took another knee, and the clock expired in a cloud of confetti that fell on both teams. For those tantalizing few moments, it looked as if it would be the Seahawks who prevailed, and as if Kearse would be the hero — not unlike Tyree had been for the Giants in a come-from-behind victory over the Patriots in 2008. “The goal is to win the game,” Kearse said. “And right now that catch doesn’t mean anything to me.”",

    "source": "Provider of TV Movie Channels Looks to Expand to PC's and Video Players <eos> Starz Entertainment Group is introducing a $9.95-a-month subscription service that will allow people to download movies from the Internet and watch them on their computers, portable video players and television sets. The new offering, called Vongo, comes at a time when movie studios and television networks are rapidly expanding their efforts to distribute their content over the Internet, experimenting with both paid and advertiser-supported models. \"We see a market out there of people who are saying, 'I want to choose what I want to watch, control how I watch it and watch it wherever I am,' \" said Robert Greene, a senior vice president at Starz, which operates pay movie channels under the Starz or Encore name and is owned by Liberty Media, the company controlled by John C. Malone, the cable entrepreneur. Since 2004, Starz has offered a movie download subscription service, called Starz Ticket, using technology from RealNetworks. But the RealNetworks software does not allow movies to be downloaded to hand-held devices. With Vongo, Starz will shift to technology from Microsoft that will allow movies to be downloaded and watched on portable video players using Microsoft's software. Until now, portable players have been costly and have found few buyers. But that is starting to change. Lower-priced players are expected to be introduced later this week at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. And of course, interest in portable video has soared with the Apple Computer video iPod, and the popularity of $1.99 episodes of TV shows sold at the iTunes online store. Microsoft will promote the Vongo service in a coming release of its Media Player software. Separately, Starz will also offer Vongo through Sony's Connect download service. Until now, Connect has mainly sold music, but executives involved with Sony's plans say that this week the company will announce an expansion to video downloads as well. Starz, which is offering a test version of the service at Vongo.com, has so far not been able to work out an arrangement for Vongo to run on iPods. This is a significant problem, said Josh Bernoff, an analyst with Forrester Research. The Microsoft Portable Media Center devices \"have not done particularly well so far,\" he said. \"They don't have the momentum that the iPod does.\" He said there would be a modest market for Vongo, mainly among people who want to watch movies on their computers, or more likely on laptops while traveling. Apple is expected to offer some sort of expanded video offering at the MacWorld conference in San Francisco next week. While Apple is closed-mouthed about its plans, there is considerable speculation among industry analysts that Apple will introduce a device that will let people watch video from the Internet on their TV sets. So far, however, Apple has not offered any subscription services for digital content (subscription services use technology that disables the music or video files on users' PC's and devices if they stop paying their monthly subscription bill). Indeed, Apple's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, has been outspoken in his belief that consumers want to own rather than rent what they listen to and watch. As a subscription service, Vongo will allow users to download as many movies as they want for $9.95 a month. They will be able to choose from an ever-changing roster of about 800 movies, including about 300 films in rotation on the Starz cable channel (mainly movies released in theaters one to three years earlier) and 500 older titles. Several years ago, when Starz renewed its long-term contracts with studios, including those owned by Sony and the Walt Disney Company, to put movies on its cable channels, it bought the rights to use them on the Internet as well. This means that other digital services cannot offer these movies in rental or subscription services during the period covered by the Starz contract. Most of the other studios sell their subscription rights to HBO or Showtime, which have been less active in digital distribution than Starz. How much interest consumers have in downloading movies remains to be seen. The legal online offerings so far -- Starz's subscription service and pay-per-view downloads from MovieLink and CinemaNow -- have attracted relatively few customers. (The pay services have to compete with illegal free trading in movie and television files over the Internet.) Some argue that most Internet users are interested only in short video clips, like news reports and the humorous video oddities that ricochet across the Web. Yet Apple's early success in selling downloads of hourlong television programs, a service that began by offering the hit series \"Lost\" and \"Desperate Housewives\" for the video iPod, is changing that perception. Mr. Greene argued that Starz had learned from its earlier experience and thought that it now had the formula to attract more customers to download movies. Vongo will be cheaper than Starz Ticket, which costs $12.95 a month and offers only about 300 movies. Vongo will also be adding some shorter original content, like music concerts and sports coverage. Starz will continue to offer the Starz Ticket service through RealNetworks, but will put all its promotional effort into Vongo. Mr. Greene said that the new Microsoft-based service was easier for consumers to use and that the company's deal with Microsoft was more economically advantageous than its deal with RealNetworks, although he declined to be specific about the terms.",

    "source": "Nat Hentoff Writes His Last for The Village Voice <eos> When he was young, Nat Hentoff said, he was lucky enough to have Duke Ellington as a mentor. This was, of course, quite some time ago, when Mr. Hentoff was writing principally about jazz and “Duke Ellington” had yet to become another way to say “West 106th Street.” He learned a lot from jazzmen, Mr. Hentoff said. Ellington taught him the perils of being pigeonholed. “He said, ‘Never get caught up in categories. That’ll imprison you,’ ” Mr. Hentoff recalled. “Duke was talking about music,” he said. But the same words could easily apply to Nat Hentoff, who — “Thank goodness,” he said — has defied categories since he began putting pen to paper more than six decades ago. In a simplistic age that likes convenient labels, you can try slapping one on him. But you’re bound to go wrong. Across his 83 years, his three dozen books and his countless newspaper columns and magazine articles, Mr. Hentoff has championed free speech and opposed censorship of any kind, whether by liberals or conservatives. Few have more assiduously and consistently defended the right of people to express their views, no matter how objectionable. In that vein, he opposes hate-crime laws as wrongly — no, make that dangerously — punishing thought. He is unalterably opposed to abortion, but he cares about life beyond the womb, so he is against capital punishment. He supported going to war in Iraq, but denounces the Bush administration’s resorting to interrogation methods regarded by much of the world as torture. He also has his doubts about President-elect Barack Obama, who, for all the adulation that we hear, “needs watching — like everybody.” He has plenty of quarrels with the American Civil Liberties Union and its New York cousin. But he also shares the civil libertarians’ displeasure with school safety agents in New York City schools who, the critics say, abuse students with City Hall’s blessing. “Teaching fear of the police is part of the curriculum,” Mr. Hentoff said. The thing is that, agree with him or not, Nat Hentoff offers no opinion that isn’t supported by facts, diligently gathered. One is tempted to say that facts are holy to him, but that is probably not the right word for someone who calls himself “a member of the Proud and Ancient Order of Stiff-Necked Jewish Atheists.” The purpose here is to note what New York is losing now that Mr. Hentoff has been laid off — we prefer to say fired — by The Village Voice after having worked there for 50 years. The weekly, financially struggling like many other newspapers, cut him loose last week. A lot of staff members have been let go since New Times Media, based in Phoenix, took over The Voice in 2005. (The company then recast itself as Village Voice Media. It seems to like the paper’s name more than the people.) But Mr. Hentoff is in a league of his own. Do not mistake this for an obituary. It’s not even close to one. Mr. Hentoff may not hear as well as he once did, or stand quite as straight. But he will not fade to silence. Citing the late journalists George Seldes and I.F. Stone as his muses, he promised in a farewell Voice column to continue “putting on my skunk suit at other garden parties.” He will write for the United Media syndicate and Jewish World Review , and also reflect on jazz, his lifelong passion, in The Wall Street Journal. He will keep pecking away on his IBM Selectric III in the Greenwich Village apartment that he turned into an office, a space that may be described most charitably as cluttered. Martha Stewart would probably freak out if she saw it. Clinging to his typewriter does not make Mr. Hentoff a Luddite. Like most of us, he relies on the Internet for research. But there is a price to be paid for that ocean of data, he cautioned, quoting a line from T. S. Eliot: “Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?” So much information brings “more confusion,” Mr. Hentoff said. “You can’t stop the spread of the Internet, the bloggers and all that,” he said, but the problem is that people tend to visit sites that only reinforce their preconceptions. “And since there’s not very much fact-checking on the Internet — although sometimes you find out a lot — the confusion continues,” he said. IN his view, nothing less than democracy is on the line, especially with “the shrinking of reporters and editors in the print media.” “I think we’re in a perilous state in that, to paraphrase Mr. Madison, the way to keep this republic is to have an informed electorate,” Mr. Hentoff said. But what we have is “Constitutional illiteracy, which is rampant.” “If you ask the first 100,000 students or adults what’s in the Fourth Amendment or what’s the separation of powers, I think you’d have some puzzlement,” he said. “And that’s, if I can use the word, dangerous.” At least we will still have Nat Hentoff on the ramparts warning of the danger, even if not in The Voice and even, he said, if he has to go it alone. That, too, is a lesson learned from an old jazzman, Ben Webster, who played tenor sax. “He said to me, ‘Listen, kid, when the rhythm section ain’t making it, go for yourself,’ ” “I’ve tried that with editors all the time,” Mr. Hentoff said. “That’s the fun of all this. You keep surprising people. “And angering them, I might say.”",

    "source": "Congress Passes Bipartisan Bill to Improve Energy Efficiency <eos> Congress on Tuesday passed a bill focused on improving energy efficiency in buildings and water heaters, a move celebrated by both parties for breaking longstanding partisan gridlock. The bill, which President Obama is expected to sign into law this week, is a modest one. But its authors, Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, who had worked together for years on more ambitious energy-saving legislation, called it a significant victory. “On the bill’s merits — creating jobs, saving consumers money and reducing pollution — it was never a hard sell,” Ms. Shaheen said. “The tough part was convincing Washington to not play politics with a good idea.” Mr. Portman said, “Our targeted energy efficiency bill has garnered widespread support because of a simple fact: It is good for the economy and good for the environment.” The two senators have been working together since 2011 on their broader energy efficiency measure. That bill, which also has bipartisan support, would create incentives for federal mortgage writers to incorporate energy-efficient heating and cooling systems into the value of a home, establish training programs in energy-efficiency construction, create programs to increase the energy efficiency of manufacturing supply chains, and direct the Energy Department to work with manufacturers on energy-efficient technology. But efforts to bring the bill to the Senate floor have been thwarted by partisan debates over issues like climate change and the Keystone XL oil pipeline. This year, the senators introduced a bill that incorporated a few elements of the broader measure. The narrower bill would create a voluntary program for landlords and tenants to improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings, mandate that large electric water heaters be run in a highly energy-efficient manner and require federal agencies to perform energy-use assessments on commercial buildings that they lease. That measure was passed by a voice vote at 4 a.m. on March 27, at the end of an all-night voting session on amendments to a budget bill. The House then passed a companion bill on Tuesday, also by a voice vote.",

    "source": "Japan Weighs Nationalizing Stricken Utility <eos> TOKYO — Japanese lawmakers publicly debated nationalizing the Tokyo Electric Power Company on Tuesday, as there seemed no end in sight to the problems at the company’s crippled nuclear power plant. The prime minister’s office said the government was not considering a takeover of Tokyo Electric “at the moment.” But the plunging stock price indicated investors were abandoning hope that the company could cope with the cost of its rebuilding and the potential liabilities from its nuclear disaster. The share price plunged an additional 19 percent Tuesday with virtually no buyers, and trading was suspended by an automatic stop. The closing price of 566 yen ($6.86) was the stock’s lowest close since at least 1974. The day before the March 11 earthquake, the shares closed at 2,153 yen (about $26). On Wednesday morning, its shares fell another 12.7 percent. The stock collapse has already erased more than 2.5 trillion yen ($30.3 billion) in market value. Also Wednesday, the president of Tokyo Electric, Masataka Shimizu, 66, was hospitalized after suffering from high blood pressure. His duties were taken over by the company’s 71-year-old chairman, Tsunehisa Katsumata, Bloomberg News reported. “There’s room for debate on the future of Tokyo Electric,” Koichiro Gemba, a member of the lower house of Parliament, said at a news conference. Mr. Gemba represents Fukushima Prefecture, home to Tokyo Electric’s damaged plant, Fukushima Daiichi. He is also the national strategy minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Naoto Kan. Mr. Gemba spoke not long after the country’s largest newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, cited unidentified people as saying the government was considering a plan to temporarily acquire a majority stake in the company, help it shoulder the liabilities that are likely to be incurred, and then eventually take it private again. But fearing that a debate about the future of the company could create a divisive and costly distraction at a time of crisis, Mr. Kan and his chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, sought to tamp down the speculation. “At the moment, the government is not considering” nationalization, Mr. Edano said Tuesday in a televised news conference. He added: “The first priority is the accident response. Then it needs to help those who’ve been affected.” If the government were to acquire a majority stake, Tepco — as the company is known — would presumably issue new stock to the state, diluting existing shareholders. The utility’s image has been hurt by the rolling blackouts it has imposed to cope with the loss of generating capacity after the earthquake and by the fact that its president, Masataka Shimizu, was not seen for several days after the quake. Tepco said Monday that Mr. Shimizu had been sick but has since returned to work. Taxpayers outside the greater Tokyo area that the company serves are likely to balk at the cost of what could be seen as a bailout. But with no end in sight to its nuclear problem, Tokyo Electric will have to lean on the state for support, analysts say. “If you were the government, would you let it go bust?” said Paul J. Scalise, a former financial analyst who is writing a book on Japan’s electric power system. “I think the answer is no. The effect on the larger economy at a critical time would be too great.” Estimates in the Japanese news media had already put the damage from the radiation leak to local homes, businesses and farms in the trillions of yen, even without knowing if anyone would suffer health damage. But it is impossible to calculate what the ultimate cost to the company will be. That is partly because the crisis appears to be far from over, and partly because it is not clear how much of the liability will actually be Tepco’s to bear. Mr. Scalise said that under Japanese law governing compensation for nuclear damage, companies were liable for the cost of all nuclear accidents resulting from reactor operations except when the accidents were provoked by a “grave natural disaster of an exceptional nature or by an insurrection.” The company might plausibly seek to avoid liability altogether within that definition, he said. Nicholas Benes, a former investment banker who is head of the Board Director Training Institute of Japan, an executive training group, said Tepco’s legal liability related to the Fukushima Daiichi plant would be covered by private and government insurance up to 120 billion yen, and even over that amount the government had wide latitude to provide financial assistance. “I just don’t see the case for nationalization at this point,” Mr. Benes said. “Unless it’s for safety reasons — for example, if you think the company is utterly incapable of managing itself. But even then you’d have to assume that a bunch of nuclear engineers put together hodgepodge by the government would do a better job than the company’s own management. I don’t think the bureaucrats possibly believe that, or would want the responsibility.” He and others said that Mr. Kan might also prefer to keep the company at arm’s length to avoid having it serve as a lightning rod for criticism of his administration. Kazuma Ogino and Toshihiro Uomoto, credit analysts at Nomura Securities, suggested in a report that what was under discussion might best be described as “a virtual nationalization,” in which the state would provide the company “with the means of paying compensation on almost all fronts.” The decline in the stock does not immediately endanger Tepco’s survival, although its cost of capital is tied to its share price. Tepco is in negotiations for loans of as much as 2 trillion yen ($24.25 billion), a person close to potential lenders said last week.",

    "source": "Bratton Gives Revolving Door One More Spin <eos> As a private consultant in 2002, William J. Bratton advised a federal monitor for the troubled Los Angeles Police Department. A few months later, Mr. Bratton was appointed the city’s police chief, binding him to practices that he had helped shape and placing him under the supervision of the monitor, Michael G. Cherkasky, his friend and former boss at the consulting firm. When Mr. Bratton stepped down as police chief in 2009, he went to work with Mr. Cherkasky again, back in the world of private security consulting. A revolving door between government service and the corporate world has long been a feature of politics, and police officials often pursue second careers after hanging up their uniforms. But few have done so with Mr. Bratton’s breadth and fluidity. Equally comfortable with boardroom jargon and precinct slang, he parlayed his national reputation for wrestling down crime in New York in the 1990s into an international brand. Now, his return to New York City for a second tour as police commissioner may create an awkward situation for Mr. Bratton, who sits on the boards of two companies who hope to do business with the city, and is a senior adviser to a third. One of them is ShotSpotter, which uses a system of outdoor microphones to pinpoint the locations of gunshots. Mr. Bratton is resigning from all three positions — forfeiting hundreds of thousands of dollars in pay — in an effort to head off any potential conflicts of interest. “I don’t see any issues at all going forward,” he said in an interview on Friday, his first since being named commissioner. “And if there is an issue that comes up, then I’ll just recuse myself from any part of the decision making on it.” In all, Mr. Bratton, 66, spent a decade doling out advice to police departments from Birmingham, Ala., to Oakland, Calif., and giving speeches about the importance of collaboration. Earlier this year, he unveiled BlueLine , a social media network for law enforcement officers. Mayors have hired his consulting company, the Bratton Group , and corporations as varied as the drugstore chain Rite Aid and Smart Cop Inc., a security software business based in Florida, have had him on their boards. A leader who relishes straddling worlds, whether dining with the powerful or patrolling the streets, Mr. Bratton bounded up the corporate ladder just as he had through police ranks. But his private career was not always a clear success. At times, he ran up against the limits of his influence, he said, finding that officials listened less to a consultant than to a commander. His time as chairman of the global risk management firm Kroll ended unceremoniously. “You soon discover that consulting is not commanding,” said John Timoney, a first deputy commissioner under Mr. Bratton in New York who now advises Bahrain on policing. “You’re not in charge.” Mr. Bratton, echoing that sentiment, said, “It’s not as, quite frankly, fun as making decisions.” Over the years, he has become associated with several prominent companies that do business — or want to do business — with the city and its Police Department. Motorola, which put Mr. Bratton on its board and paid him about $240,000 in cash and stock awards in 2012, has made at least $63 million from city contracts since 2010, mostly for telecommunications technology, according to public records. (That figure may be higher; the Police Department does not make all of its contracts publicly available, citing security concerns.) Kroll has earned roughly $1.8 million from city contracts since 2010. A spokesman for the firm’s holding company, Altegrity, where Mr. Bratton was also a chairman, would not discuss his pay at the privately held company. In May, Mr. Bratton joined the board of ShotSpotter, a private company. The company lobbied the city in 2009 but was not selected for testing in New York City. The Police Department said it later tested gunshot detection technology from Safety Dynamics, a competitor, and found too many false positives. However, ShotSpotter’s fortunes appear likely to improve under Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, who said on his campaign website that he “will invest” in the company’s technology for high-crime areas. Before then, Mr. Bratton will resign from the board, said Ralph A. Clark, the chief executive of ShotSpotter, which is based in Newark, Calif.; he would not comment on Mr. Bratton’s pay for the position. Mr. Bratton said he and Mr. de Blasio “never had a conversation about ShotSpotter,” adding that “if the city were to go forward on whatever proposal that company might make, that’s an example of something I’d have to recuse myself from.” Video Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio announced William J. Bratton as his choice for commissioner of the New York City Police Department. Credit Credit Ozier Muhammad/The New York Times Mr. Bratton said he was also stepping down from the board of Motorola. He added that he would not give paid speeches or consult with outside governments while police commissioner, and was working with the city’s Conflicts of Interest Board to comply with city law on his other business engagements. As commissioner in the 1990s, Mr. Bratton courted executives like Jack Welch of General Electric to talk to commanders at Police Headquarters, and flew on the private jets of his friends. (He later reimbursed his friends — paying nearly $12,000 — after the flights and stays at their homes came to the public’s attention.) Outside government, Mr. Bratton mixed easily with powerful business leaders, who saw him both as a strategic thinker and as a personality who lent credibility to their endeavors and opened avenues into public sector work. He transformed his data-driven approach to crime into a lucrative career as a global management consultant for the police. Chuck Wexler, the director of the nonprofit Police Executive Research Forum, said Mr. Bratton’s rise coincided with the thinking two decades ago about the impact of good police leadership on crime. “And if you think about it,” he said, “there are not a lot of people who can speak to it at the level of Bratton.” The Bratton Group, a private company founded in 1999, has one employee — Mr. Bratton — but brings together teams of former law enforcement officials to consult police departments in places like Baltimore, Detroit and Mamaroneck, N.Y. Almost immediately after leaving the New York Police Department, Mr. Bratton found himself scooped up by a private security firm based in Boston. By 1997, he was back on patrol — in the favelas of the Brazilian coastal city of Fortaleza, where he found officers eager for his counsel. But while Mr. Bratton found receptive partners in Brazil, he also bumped up against the realities of life as a consultant on the other side of the blue wall. Despite a rousing welcome in Caracas, Venezuela, in 2001, complete with a police band rendition of “New York, New York,” Mr. Bratton faced political realities beyond his control. The city’s mayor, Alfredo Peña, and the country’s president, Hugo Chávez, were at odds; the police became political; and an American’s advice was suddenly suspect. Soon, graffiti appeared on the streets: “Bratton Go Home.” Around 1999, Mr. Cherkasky, the federal monitor in Los Angeles and president of Kroll at the time, brought Mr. Bratton to the private security firm. “Brand, brand, brand,” said Mr. Cherkasky, describing his reasons for hiring him that first time and then again in 2009, at Altegrity. Mr. Bratton, he said, could attract business by reputation alone. “He’s getting calls from the prime minister of the United Kingdom,” Mr. Cherkasky said. Mr. Bratton announced his departure from the Los Angeles Police Department in 2009, a month after a federal judge began phasing out oversight by the federal monitor, Mr. Cherkasky, who had recommended the judge do so. Critics complained that that resolution appeared to be curiously well timed, since Mr. Bratton returned to work for Mr. Cherkasky right after. “It raises the obvious question of whether the consent decree was really comprehensive and thoroughgoing, or if Cherkasky and Bratton were in a hurry to move on,” said Tom Hayden, a former California state senator. Mr. Bratton’s time as chairman at Altegrity turned rocky, according to several former employees of the company, who requested anonymity because they were not permitted to discuss internal dealings. “There were a lot of departures,” a former managing partner said. “If you’ve got a smoothly running operation, people tend not to jump ship.” Mr. Cherkasky said that after he left Altegrity in 2011, “it did not go great” for Mr. Bratton, who had become a nonexecutive chairman at Kroll after Altegrity purchased the company. Mr. Bratton did not have a role in the day-to-day operations or management of the company, he said, adding that his position “was not particularly stimulating or satisfying to me.” He would not comment on whether problems arose while he was employed there, and said he left when his three-year contract ended. A spokesman for Altegrity, which is owned by Providence Equity Partners, a private equity firm, would not discuss the details of Mr. Bratton’s tenure or make any employees available for an interview. Mr. Bratton kept a corner office at Kroll’s Manhattan headquarters and remained a senior adviser after leaving his post as chairman last year. On the fourth floor, near Mr. Bratton’s office, a champagne toast this month signaled an end to his ties there. “Bill will be stepping down,” the company said in a statement. “We wish him all the best in his new role.”",

    "source": "Members of Al Qaeda in Iraq Clash With Government Troops <eos> CAIRO — Insurgents from Al Qaeda in Iraq clashed with the country’s security forces on Thursday, the second attack this week in what the insurgent group’s leader has depicted as a new offensive aimed at recapturing lost ground. The attack came as Syrian refugees tried to flee across the Iraqi border, joining migrations to Turkey and Lebanon over the past week. At a border crossing near Al Qaim, Iraq , where the Syrian side of the border was under rebel control, more than 2,000 Syrian refugees arrived in recent days, said Saadoun Shallan, head of the Anbar Provincial Council. At least 12 people were killed in an attack in Diyala Province, including five Iraqi policemen and seven militants, a police official said. The Associated Press reported that an Iraqi helicopter was shot down, but Iraqi officials said it had only been damaged. The fighting began Wednesday night in Hadid, a town about six miles northwest of Baquba. The area was once an insurgent stronghold. “It was fierce fighting and lasted several hours between the security forces and Al Qaeda fighters,” said Blaer Hassan, a provincial security official in Diyala. “This is a setback because we are worried about the capacity of Iraqi forces in the face of the growing strength of Al Qaeda,” he added. On Sunday, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, who uses the pseudonym Abu Bakir al-Baghdadi, announced in an unusual audio recording, posted on a jihadi Web site, that an offensive was about to begin in which the insurgents would seek to regain ground they had held in Iraq before American forces helped oust them. The next day, the group began a coordinated series of at least 40 attacks that killed more than 100 people throughout Iraq. Al Qaeda has also announced its intention to join the conflict in Syria on the side of the popular uprising there, although opposition leaders have disavowed any connection with extremist groups.",

    "source": "Christie’s Re-election Engine Gets in Gear for a Bigger Race <eos> BOSTON — He has hired specialists in microtargeting who worked for the presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney and George W. Bush. He has built a sprawling, 50-state fund-raising network, including major Republican players like Harold Simmons, the billionaire backer of a Karl Rove-led “super PAC” that spent $105 million in the 2012 race. And he is pouring resources into an effort to attract blacks, Hispanics and women to prove that he is a new kind of Republican. As Gov. Chris Christie heads for what is expected to be an easy re-election, he is also quietly building a sophisticated political operation that could become the basis for a national campaign. His advisers, while saying the governor is focused on New Jersey, are aiming to run up a huge margin against his Democratic opponent and position Mr. Christie as a formidable figure among Republicans ahead of the next presidential primary. At the Republican National Committee summer meeting in Boston last week, Mr. Christie and his aides repeatedly made the case that his re-election effort in heavily Democratic New Jersey this fall would offer a model for Republicans in the years ahead. And despite their claims to be focused only on 2013, his aides have also signaled to Republicans that the governor, if re-elected as expected, plans to begin visiting other states immediately after November. Mr. Christie’s appearance at the twice-annual gathering of Republican state officials was significant. In addition to courting the conservative-leaning party activists, he met privately with two Republicans who could be helpful in a presidential race: Spencer Zwick, Mr. Romney’s well-connected chief fund-raiser, and Scott P. Brown, the former Republican senator from Massachusetts who is considering a Senate run in New Hampshire, which holds the first presidential primary. Already, Mr. Christie is assembling the kind of national fund-raising network that would be essential to a presidential campaign; some 35 percent of the $9 million he has raised for his re-election is from out of state, and he has held fund-raisers around the country, both in donor-rich enclaves like Palm Beach, Fla., and McLean, Va., and in Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Chicago and throughout California. Thanks to his prominence, and the fact that New Jersey is one of only two states with contests for governor this year, Mr. Christie has been able to cultivate big donors around the country. “Under the guise of his re-election, he’s able to meet these folks and say, ‘I need your help,’ ” Mr. Rove said. The governor has tapped some boldface contributors like the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. But more important for his future ambitions are the checks he has gathered from loyal Republican givers like Mr. Simmons, the deep-pocketed Dallas political patron, and lesser-known local power players like Dax R. Swatek, an Alabama lobbyist. “I wrote him a check because, first, I think, as a Republican in New Jersey doing what he’s been able to do is pretty damn impressive,” said Mr. Swatek, who is close to many of his state’s leading Republicans. “Secondly, looking at it long-term, the way the presidential map is, it is going to be very difficult for Republicans to win without going into some states that are purple and blue. To me, the guy can do it.” Not all of Mr. Christie’s donors this year can be counted on to support him if he runs for president in 2016. But winning the backing of people like Mr. Swatek, who can raise money from a wide variety of sources, helps the governor reach potential presidential donors in other state capitals and business communities across the country. Mike DuHaime, Mr. Christie’s chief strategist, has also reached out to Mercer Reynolds, a Cincinnati executive who is one of the Republican Party’s top contributors and was Mr. Bush’s finance chair in 2000. Earlier this month, Mr. Christie held a fund-raiser at a Las Vegas hotel owned by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Mr. Adelson and his wife, two of the biggest contributors to Republicans last year, were listed as co-hosts and each gave Mr. Christie the maximum contribution of $3,800. Of course, the governor has a long way to go to prove to Republicans nationally that he can be the party standard-bearer, and some conservative activists are still smarting over his embrace of President Obama in the days after Hurricane Sandy. And New Jersey voters may resent what they see as his exploiting state issues to appeal to the conservative wing of the national party. The governor recently vetoed $7.5 million in family planning spending and Friday vetoed three gun-control measures. Barbara Buono, his opponent in the governor’s race, frequently says he “would rather be campaigning in the cornfields of Iowa.” According to an analysis by Democrats, since last August Mr. Christie was outside of New Jersey for all or part of 91 days, or roughly 24 percent of the time. Mr. Christie emphasized that much of that out-of-state travel was for nonpolitical trips. Senior Republicans who are familiar with Mr. Christie’s strategy say it is most closely modeled after Mr. Bush’s bid in 1998 for re-election as governor of Texas. The parallels are clear. Mr. Bush was considered a shoo-in for re-election to the governor’s office, but he and Mr. Rove became determined to win over Hispanic and black voters to demonstrate the governor’s broad appeal to a national audience. Mr. Bush won that race, with 68 percent of the vote, which included more than a third of the Hispanic vote, offering him a powerful credential when he ran for president two years later as “a different kind of Republican.” This summer, Mr. Christie established a bilingual campaign office in Paterson, N.J., and spent $275,000 on a Spanish-language television ad. He has also announced a Hispanics for Christie coalition and is now running even among Hispanic voters against Ms. Buono, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released 10 days ago. “He’s going to emphasize first trying to win a big re-election with a diverse coalition behind him,” Mr. Rove said. Despite his lead, Mr. Christie is spending expansively to enhance his targeting of voters this year. While his core team is filled with fixtures of presidential politics — including Mr. DuHaime, the ad man Russell J. Schriefer, the communications director Maria Comella and the campaign chairman, William J. Palatucci — he has brought aboard a new Republican firm, Deep Root Analytics. The group includes strategists from Mr. Bush’s 2004 campaign and the consultants who ran Mr. Romney’s data effort last year, and is helping Mr. Christie direct his advertising more precisely by determining what voters are watching on TV, and from that, deciding what ads to air and when. (Mr. Obama’s campaign used the same technology in 2012.) “The unspoken element in the room is that this could potentially be a test of what works and what doesn’t” for a presidential contest, said a Republican with knowledge of the inner workings of the campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid antagonizing Mr. Christie’s circle. The timing gives Mr. Christie distinct advantages: If he prevails in November, he will be handed a big national platform — the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association. The position will give him a reason, and ample time, to travel the country, meet with activists and candidates, and raise unlimited money for the association, freed from federal and state regulations that limit him as governor from seeking contributions from those that do business with the state. Early primary states, including Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, are holding governors’ races next year, so Mr. Christie will surely visit. And he will ultimately get to play the role of political Santa Claus inside the Republican Party, distributing millions in campaign cash to grateful governors and would-be governors. Even if Mr. Christie is well-positioned, however, skepticism toward him within the Republican base is still real. And, despite the warm reception he received in Boston, some resistance was apparent. “I just really had a little bit of a problem with him embracing Obama,” explained Paul Reynolds, the national Republican committeeman from Alabama, after Mr. Christie spoke. “I’ve got to get over that.” The broader challenge for Mr. Christie regarding party activists is that he is not seen as sufficiently tough on a president the Republican base loathes, and is too quick to throw an elbow at other Republicans, as he did with Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky on national security issues last month. William Kristol, the editor of the conservative Weekly Standard who recently met privately with Mr. Christie over pizza, said the governor must avoid being seen as the Republican who likes to beat up on his own party. “The party hates that and they will not forgive it,” Mr. Kristol said. “A Republican who simply comes from a different part of the country, has a few differences on issues but respects the actual Republican primary voter worldview — that’s a different story. That’s the line Christie needs to walk. He doesn’t have to be a red state Republican, but he needs to respect red state Republicans.”",

    "source": "Mavericks Begin With Roster in Flux and a Focus on Repeating <eos> DALLAS — Even as they spoke of repeating as champions, the Dallas Mavericks were not sure exactly who would embark on the defense of their title on Christmas Day here against the Miami Heat. Depleted by free agency, Dallas opened training camp Friday with 10 players at its American Airlines Center practice facility, including the newly signed forward Brandan Wright. As the Los Angeles Lakers, the New Orleans Hornets and the Houston Rockets jousted with the league over the blockbuster Chris Paul trade, the Mavericks clearly have been cast as an afterthought in the Western Conference, a role Jason Kidd likened to last season’s low expectations. “People thought we were a team that wouldn’t even get out of the first round,” Kidd said. “Maybe that’s the same label. For us, it’s something that we learned last year. You’ve just got to go out there and play and see what happens.” Forward Shawn Marion said: “We’ve been proving doubters wrong all the time. We’re good at that. We’re probably going to have some more pieces here, but for the most part we’re ready to go.” Tyson Chandler’s expected departure to the Knicks created the biggest void, and Mavericks Coach Rick Carlisle officially announced Brendan Haywood as the new starting center. Beyond that, the Mavericks figure to scramble. Caron Butler, injured most of last season, left for the Clippers. Guard J. J. Barea, who played a pivotal role in their title run, is reportedly in discussions with at least six teams and is not expected back. DeShawn Stevenson is also not likely to return. Peja Stojakovic and Brian Cardinal were pondering their free-agent options and were not at the first practice. “I’m anxious to see what are roster is going to end up looking like because it’s obviously not complete yet,” Carlisle said. “We had some guys that did some great things for us here that probably aren’t going to be back,” Carlisle said. “But that’s part of the circle of life in the N.B.A. We’re all going to adjust. Guys are going to step up into some opportunistic situations. We plan on defending our crown with a lot of pride.” All optimism centers on the aging nucleus of Kidd, who turns 39 in March; Dirk Nowitzki , 33; Jason Terry, 34, and Marion, 33. Kidd, entering his 18th season, said he wanted to play another three years and hoped to end his career with the Mavericks. “Hopefully, my talent will stay at a respectable level where I can help a team out,” he said. “I’d love to stay here and finish it out. I’d like to get to 20 years.” Kidd said he even told Nowitzki he wanted to keep playing so that the two could retire together. A joke, perhaps, but he and the older Mavericks clearly do not want to let go of their late-career success. “The makeup of the team is probably going to be a little different, but that’s just the business of basketball,” Kidd said. “That happens. But we still believe we can win. We’re going to take pride in trying to protect our championship.” The Mavericks steered away from any comments about the Lakers and the trade controversy surrounding Paul and the N.B.A. Carlisle insisted he was only concerned about who was in camp, even if it was only 10 players for the first practice. “The N.B.A. will take care of whatever that situation is,” Kidd said. “For me, it’s trying to figure out here what we have to do to win.”",

    "source": "Exploring Anarchism in a Play at the Library <eos> In spite of an emphatically bourgeois background, the Miser, as a youngster, fancied himself enough of an anarchist to scrawl the famous symbol of a capital A enclosed in a circle on his denim jacket in indelible black ink. Subsequent efforts actually to understand anarchism revealed its philosophical depth and long history. Two of the more remarkable figures in that history are Emma Goldman, the Lithuanian-born anarchist writer, theorist and orator, and Mary Wollstonecraft, wife of the proto-anarchist philosopher William Godwin and author of the seminal feminist text “A Vindication of the Rights of Woman.” Had they met, Wollstonecraft and Goldman, born nearly 100 years apart, probably would have had much to talk about. That tantalizing thought drives “ Emma Meets Mary ,” a play by the New York performer and playwright Lorna Lable. You can see it free this Saturday at the New York Public Library’s Bloomingdale branch on the Upper West Side. Set in a sort of heaven for radicals, the show is a lighthearted take on a fictional duel between two serious and influential minds. (Saturday at 2 p.m., 150 West 100th Street, Manhattan; 212-222-8030, nypl.org.) COMFORT IN PHOTOGRAPHY Around the time Goldman emigrated to New York, in the mid-1880s, a young woman living on Staten Island was taking her first photographs with a camera given to her by an uncle. The woman, Alice Austen, would eventually be recognized as a pioneering female photographer whose subjects ranged from pastoral scenes and documentary work to more experimental tableaus, as well as daily life at her family’s home, a waterfront estate on Hylan Boulevard known as Clear Comfort. The house, declared a landmark by the city in 1971 and now a museum known simply as the Alice Austen House, has recently undergone a substantial restoration and is hosting a Community Open House this Saturday. The free afternoon-long affair includes tours of the house and garden and live performances organized by Deep Tanks Studio . (Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., 2 Hylan Boulevard, near Edgewater Street, Rosebank; 718-816-4506, aliceausten.org.)",

    "source": "Talking Parades With the Police <eos> Dear Diary: On my first Halloween in Gotham City, an old boyfriend and I retreated to the warmth of a deli on 50th Street. We had tried to go to the parade, but I was too cold in my flowy, black, not-meant-for-New-York-autumn skirt. We were dressed as Batman and Batwoman. I had spent hours perfecting a Batwoman mask painted onto my forehead and cheeks. When I was two bites into my deli cheeseburger, three police officers approached the section where we were seated. One of the officers nonchalantly invited himself to our table, pulling up a chair. He asked us what seemed like 20,000 questions: how old we were, how we met, our plans for the night and so on. I felt confused, nervous and slightly ridiculous in my costume. The officer’s female partner, sitting a few tables away, laughed. She eventually yelled at him to leave us alone. The tension broken, we talked with the three officers for a while. We asked if they knew the best spot if we wanted to try another parade come Thanksgiving. They got a call on their radios and had to rush away. Just when I thought I had survived my first New York Police Department questioning, the woman officer pulled out her notebook and asked for names and phone numbers. My heart skipped a beat. Were we being given a ticket? Detained? For what? She smiled and said they would give us a call if they had any leads on good viewing spots for Thanksgiving morning. We never heard back, and left the Macy’s parade early because of the cold, too.",

    "source": "Young Jets Safety Emulates Veteran Teammate With Pivotal Play <eos> EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The genesis of Antonio Allen’s blocked punt and touchdown in the second quarter Sunday can be traced back to last Monday, when the Jets’ special-teams coordinator, Ben Kotwica, told Allen to line up just off the center, rather than off the edge. Allen did not really know why. He said Kotwica had noticed something with Oakland’s long snapper, or maybe it was the tackle. Fighting for playing time, trying to establish himself as a playmaker, Allen was not about to question the move. Newly positioned, he burst through the middle of the line so smoothly it was as if he were being hoisted by pulleys. He could have blocked Marquette King’s punt with his sternum. “He put me in the perfect place to make the play,” Allen said of Kotwica. Allen fell on the ball in the end zone and braced himself for a pileup. But there was not a Raiders player within 10 yards. “It felt weird — they just let me loose,” Allen said. “I was surprised. I thought that the tackle was going to give me some kind of push, but he didn’t even touch me. He just let me go right through.” The score gave the Jets a 20-3 lead with 3 minutes 55 seconds left in the half. They were not exactly struggling to move the ball, but with the inconsistency of the offense this season, and their difficulties stopping Oakland, the early cushion was welcomed. “Sometimes you need special teams to pick up the defense,” Coach Rex Ryan said. “That’s the mark of a team.” On the sideline, Ed Reed congratulated Allen, a fellow safety, on his play, a game-changing score that might have reminded Reed a little bit of himself. An interesting dynamic has developed between the two players — one at the beginning of his career, the other in his professional twilight — since Reed arrived four weeks earlier and supplanted Allen in the starting lineup. At the time, it was viewed as a deferential move to a nine-time Pro Bowl selection and the N.F.L.’s active leader in interceptions with 62. The Jets hoped Reed, 35, would find comfort in Ryan’s system and turn back the clock to their days together in Baltimore. Of course, things did not exactly go that way, and Reed’s quiet first three games with the Jets opened him up to criticism. Questions were raised about his age and ability, and some wondered what role would be left for Allen. Allen, 25 and in his second season, wondered a bit about that himself. He said Sunday that he had been satisfied with his performance and progress for the first nine games of the season, before Reed arrived. “I thought I was having a pretty productive season,” he said. “I was thinking coming into the season, this was going to be my breakout year.” But what could have been a combative relationship has instead become a congenial one. Allen said he had benefited from Reed’s arrival and his mentorship on the practice field and in the locker room. “He gives me little tips to pick up on,” Allen said. “I try to follow him.” And so there Allen had been, on the sideline, congratulating Reed after his first interception of the season, which set the Jets up for a field goal on the series just before Allen’s blocked punt. “Nobody’s perfect playing this game,” Reed said. “I welcome anybody who wants to watch film with me. There’s a reason why I’m on this side of the fence.” Reed remained the starter Sunday, but Allen generally played on third downs and when Oakland’s mobile quarterback, Terrell Pryor, was in the game. Reed also appeared to have injured his right knee on a miscommunication with cornerback Antonio Cromartie, a midfield collision that resulted in a 48-yard Raiders touchdown. But he stayed in the game. “Ed had a nice pick and did a nice job of communicating things,” Ryan said. “We’re trying to take advantage of the talent that we have. We knew it would be a physical game, so we tried to put some of the youngsters in there to take some of the heat.” Afterward, one of those young players seemed like the happiest in the locker room. “It feels good to make a play on special teams,” Allen said. “I’ve been trying to make plays with whatever happens with my playing time. It’s big for me and big for the team.”",

    "source": "New York’s Sanitation Commissioner Faced First Major Test <eos> Kathryn Garcia stopped by Sanitation Department garages to check on her workers. She stood with Mayor Bill de Blasio to take questions about storm preparations. And she prepared herself for the snow that was threatening New York and would be the first big test of her tenure as the city’s sanitation commissioner. But she had started her day on Monday with an email from John J. Doherty , who preceded her as commissioner and who had risen to the top job after starting as a trash collector more than 50 years ago. The storm would turn out to be far less damaging than feared. But on Monday morning, with attention on the city and the Sanitation Department, and few people understood better what Ms. Garcia was facing than Mr. Doherty. He had worked for the department under eight mayoral administrations and he had heard every manner of snow-related sanitation complaint, not least last winter when a succession of storms battered the city and the new administration of Mr. de Blasio, which had asked Mr. Doherty to stay on through last winter. Image Mr. Garcia's predecessor as commissioner, John Doherty, sent an email with encouragement to her as the storm headed toward the New York region. Credit Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times So it was that he emailed Ms. Garcia, with something of a digital pep talk. She had an experienced and effective work force, he reminded her. “Don’t worry; they’re going to do great,” Ms. Garcia recalled Mr. Doherty’s telling her. In an interview, Mr. Doherty said: “I just wanted to encourage her. I wanted to thank her as an old commissioner. I took some blows over the years.” Before departing last spring, Mr. Doherty had passed along some advice. “He gave me his secret list, as he likes to call it,” Ms. Garcia said. Mr. Doherty said it was a double-spaced, two-page checklist that included making sure to notify City Hall and reviewing alternate-side parking. Ms. Garcia, 44, however, had some experience of her own in big municipal crises. Before being named to lead the Sanitation Department, she was the chief operating officer of the Department of Environmental Protection , and on Monday, the mayor praised Ms. Garcia’s leadership in restoring operations at a wastewater treatment plant and 42 pumping stations within days of Hurricane Sandy . It was not her only big event at the environmental department, and more than once she had spent the night in her office at the agency. Late on Monday and early on Tuesday, she was again sleeping in an office, this time at the building on Worth Street that is the headquarters for the Sanitation Department’s operations.",

    "source": "Municipal Bonds Are on a Tear, but for How Long? <eos> DESPITE warnings of defaults near the start of this year, municipal bond funds have turned in a Cinderella performance so far, even as many stock funds lost ground. Total returns for some muni funds were in the 10 percent range for the calendar year, although their 12-month returns were generally lower. Analysts and fund managers see continued good performance for intermediate and long-term muni funds, along with periods of high volatility. Miriam Sjoblom, lead bond fund analyst at Morningstar, said, “Muni bonds have had a great year, but yields across all levels are near all-time lows.” As a result, she said, “yields are likely to rise, so prices could fall.” Many fund shareholders have been “buying and selling at the wrong time,” Ms. Sjoblom said. There was a surge of sales last November, December and January, she added, amid fears that state and city fiscal woes could lead to waves of defaults. That hasn’t happened, and, she said, the funds have turned in “a great performance since then.” Still, muni bond funds had a net outflow of $1.01 billion in August, the Investment Company Institute said late last month. In Ms. Sjoblom’s opinion, the funds are appropriate for anyone seeking tax-exempt income in a regular account, not a retirement account. Investors should be prepared to hold them at least a year, or preferably several years. Given today’s low-yield environment, she said, investors should focus on no-load funds with low expenses, like those from Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price. Investors should be aware of three other considerations when choosing a muni fund:  Interest paid by state and local governments and agencies is generally tax-exempt for in-state residents, but when people own bonds from another state — say, a Californian who invests in Texas bonds — their home states often tax the out-of-state interest. So many fund groups offer state-specific funds.  Capital gains that are incurred either when a portfolio manager trades holdings — or when an individual shareholder sells — are taxable.  Some municipal bonds, while exempt from regular taxes, are not exempt from alternative minimum taxes, so investors who face a perennial A.M.T. obligation should select funds with little or no A.M.T. exposure. Regina Shafer, who manages three municipal bond funds — short-term, intermediate-term and New York — for USAA in San Antonio , another no-load, low-expense organization, said, “Our goal is to provide as much tax-free income as possible and to try to be very tax-efficient and avoid taxable capital gains.” The market has changed greatly since 2008, she said. Before that disastrous year, she said, muni bond insurers guaranteed bonds’ triple-A ratings, “so an investor didn’t have to think” much about individual holdings. Now credit research is important, she said, and there is more interest-rate volatility, which brings opportunity. Ms. Shafer called muni bonds “a safe asset class” over all, pointing out that municipalities have taxing authority, unlike corporate issuers. Yields on munis in the 10- to 20-year range are actually higher than those of comparable Treasuries, which are taxable, making many munis very attractive right now, she said. In a similar vein, Jason T. Thomas, chief investment officer of Aspiriant, a national fee-only wealth management firm, said, “By almost every measure, municipal bonds are priced attractively relative to U.S. Treasuries and U.S. corporate bonds.” He contends that concerns about munis are overblown. The market is diverse, he said, and defaults have historically been rare, with 10-year cumulative default rates for all municipals of less than one-tenth of 1 percent. Aspiriant uses short-, intermediate- and long-term municipal funds from Vanguard and a commingled separate account for clients. In the high-yield part of the market, research and active management are crucial, he said, and his firm uses the Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond fund, which Morningstar says had a total return of 10.05 percent for the first nine months of this year. The 10-year cumulative default rate for high-yield munis is just over one-half of 1 percent, he said, citing studies that have found that muni defaults often share these characteristics: They are issued by smaller entities for risky or nonessential projects like a municipal golf course, are not rated, or are rated by only one rating agency and are nongeneral obligation bonds. On the other hand, he said, these factors reduced the risk of defaults: a low current cost of debt service, opportunities for increased revenue like raising property taxes, efforts by governments to cut expenses, and the relatively high security of states’ general obligation bonds. And while states’ costly obligations for their pension plans are often cited as a worry, he said those obligations are long term in nature, giving plan sponsors time to make needed adjustments. Barnet Sherman, portfolio manager of the TIAA-CREF Tax-Exempt Bond fund, called munis “a tremendous value, a core part of a fixed-income portfolio.” His fund holds only investment-grade issues, no junk. The best returns come from long-term investments, he said, adding that munis are desirable because they finance schools, ports, hospitals — “the fabric of a community.”",

    "source": "Tougher Standards Set for U.S. Visa Waivers, Citing Militant Threat <eos> WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security has toughened air travel requirements on foreign governments in response to what it believes is the growing threat from fighters who have gone to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State and other groups, senior American officials said Thursday. The changes will be applied to the so-called visa waiver program that the United States has with 38 countries. The program allows citizens of those countries to enter the United States on visits of fewer than 90 days without being interviewed for visas at American consulates and embassies. Countries participating in the program will now be required to allow more American air marshals on flights to the United States. They also must use passports that rely on biometric identifiers, like fingerprints, and have electronic chips that contain a photograph of the holder. Older passports typically do not have these features. A small percentage of travelers who entered the United States last year through the visa waiver program had the older passports. The countries will have to use computer programs and databases that automate the sharing of travel records and other information with the United States and that track lost and stolen passports. Many European countries — including Britain, Belgium, Germany and France — that have a large number of citizens who have traveled to Iraq and Syria are part of the waiver program. The Obama administration fears that these citizens might have received training while they were in Iraq or Syria and could then use the new expertise to wage attacks in the United States or on American airliners, the officials said. Last September, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution that called for countries to share more information about travelers in an effort to identify foreign fighters. While American intelligence agencies say they can track these combatants, some administration officials believe that other countries could be doing more. Where ISIS Has Directed and Inspired Attacks Around the World More than a dozen countries have had attacks since the Islamic State, or ISIS, began to pursue a global strategy in the summer of 2014. “As I have said a number of times now, the current global threat environment requires that we know more about those who travel to the United States,” Jeh Johnson, the secretary for homeland security, said in a written statement. “This includes those from countries for which we do not require a visa.” The Department of Homeland Security will also conduct a review of all the countries participating in the waiver program to determine whether they are following its requirements. Those findings will probably lead to additional scrutiny at border crossings for travelers from countries that the department has determined have weaknesses in their screening processes. The visa waiver program was created in 1988 to expedite travel between the United States and its allies. Participating countries are required to meet certain standards for aviation and border security. They are also expected to have strong laws and safeguards to prevent counterfeiting of passports. Instead of applying for a visa, travelers using the waiver program have to fill out a special form and receive approval from Customs and Border Protection before boarding a flight to the United States. Last fall, the department added new questions to its visa waiver applications. Six months ago, it began a review of the program to determine whether it could be exploited by foreign fighters. “D.H.S. is also considering options available to encourage compliance, beyond utilizing the most stringent option of removing a country from the program, measures that are designed to achieve greater global security,” according to a department document. The department will not make any changes to the United States’ programs with other countries “without first consulting with the affected country,” the document said. The United States believes that at least 18,000 foreign combatants, including more than 3,000 Europeans, have made their way to Syria since the conflict began there in 2011. Roughly 500 of them have returned to European countries. The “security enhancements” announced on Thursday, Mr. Johnson said, “are part of this department’s continuing assessments of our homeland security in the face of evolving threats and challenges, and our determination to stay one step ahead of those threats and challenges.” He added that the changes would not “hinder lawful trade and travel with our partners in the visa waiver program.”",

    "source": "Pakistani Army Poised for New Push Into Swat <eos> PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Residents flooded out of the Swat Valley by the thousands on Tuesday as the government prepared to mount a new military campaign against Taliban militants and as a much-criticized peace accord with the insurgents fell apart. People crammed into cars and buses and headed south after the local government told residents to leave Swat before a government military offensive. On Sunday, black-turbaned Taliban fighters seized control of Mingora, Swat’s capital. Since then, Taliban and government forces have accused each other of scuttling the peace accord, and they traded gun and mortar fire. The Taliban had dug in and laid mines in the streets, girding for battle, residents said. President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with President Obama in Washington, where American officials have sharply criticized the peace accord and urged the government to fight the Taliban. Two weeks ago, the Taliban used the territory all but ceded to them under the accord to push into another district, Buner , just 60 miles from the capital, Islamabad, prompting American calls for tougher action. A new operation in Swat may signal the harder stance American officials have been looking for. But the question remains whether the Pakistani military has the will and ability to sustain its operations against the insurgents, the vast majority of whom are Pakistani. The American special envoy for the region, Richard C. Holbrooke, said Tuesday that the situation in Pakistan was fragile, but he welcomed the turn toward wider military action. “Until yesterday, the momentum did not appear to be in the right hands,” he told Congress. “The army has now begun a major offensive. We’ll have to wait and see how it goes.” The Pakistani military has battled the militants reluctantly in the past, but it is now engaged in heavy fighting with the Taliban in two other districts, Buner and Dir, that border Swat in the North-West Frontier Province. Those campaigns are daunting enough. But the task in Swat remains hugely difficult, not least because the military had already failed to drive out the Taliban in two years of fighting before it finally conceded to the February truce and agreed to allow Islamic law to be imposed in the valley. But public opinion in Pakistan has undergone an important shift against the Taliban since the deal, and it has now apparently given the military more confidence to move with full force. A recent video showing the Taliban in Swat flogging a young woman as the militants enforced their version of Islamic law shocked the nation. The government has taken great pains to show its efforts to make the Swat peace deal work, going as far as agreeing to appoint judges trained in Islamic law, or Shariah. Finally, the Taliban incursion into Buner solidified a growing consensus that the Taliban had gone too far and that the military needed to stop them. The media, politicians and even religious leaders are now speaking out against Maulana Sufi Muhammad, the main negotiator of the Swat deal, and Mullah Fazlullah, his son-in-law, who has links to the Qaeda-backed Taliban movement based in Pakistan’s tribal areas. Leaders of the Awami National Party, which governs the North-West Frontier Province, continue to stand by the deal, which they say is critical in winning people away from the militants. The deal was popular among the people of Swat, who were desperate for peace. An estimated half million people have been displaced by the fighting in the tribal areas and in the North-West Frontier Province over the past two years. Those fleeing Buner and Swat, many of whom will now stay in camps or with relatives in cities like Mardan or Peshawar, have criticized the military operations as heavy handed. But the Taliban have revealed in the past three months that they have no intention of ending their insurgency inside Pakistan proper. It has also become apparent, the politicians say, that Maulana Muhammad is not able to control the militants. “Now we have the upper hand,” said Saqib Chamkani, a member of the provincial assembly for the Awami National Party. “We have exposed that this fight does not have anything to do with courts and Shariah.” Yet the military remains divided in its resolve, the United States remains deeply unpopular and some religious parties still sympathize with the Taliban. Anees Jillani, a lawyer who works at the Supreme Court and who visited Swat recently, said some in the military had sympathy for the Islamists and were not willing to fight. “When you ask them why are you not defeating them, they ask: ‘Why should we?’ And you ask about Sufi Muhammad, they say: ‘What’s wrong with him?’ ” he said. Maulana Yousuf Shah, general secretary of the Jamiat-u-Ulama-i-Islam-S, a political party that is close to the Taliban, blamed the government for failing to keep its side of the February truce. Maulana Muhammad was therefore unable to convince the younger Taliban fighters to keep the peace, he said. “For 20 years these people have been struggling peacefully for Shariah, but it was no use,” he said. “It is a natural thing when democratic avenues are not working to take up arms.” At the same time, though, there has been a significant change in the military and paramilitary forces facing against the Taliban. Under the leadership of Maj. Gen. Tariq Khan, an energetic and determined commander, the Frontier Corps, a local Pashtun paramilitary force, has become better armed and equipped, with the help of the United States. Supported by army units, the Frontier Corps has proven itself better able to push back the Taliban, first in the tribal areas in Bajaur last year, and now in Buner, though at a considerable cost to civilians caught up in the operations. In Peshawar, capital of the North-West Frontier Province, antiterrorist police units have killed 88 people suspected of being militants in the past four months, cracking down on kidnapping and general lawlessness, a senior police official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of his work. “It is a manageable problem,” he said, when asked whether Pakistan can contain the militant threat. American support has been important, he said, and the police are hoping for the same help, he said. “If Uncle Sam shows the same generosity to our force, I don’t see why we cannot be a good supporting force,” he said.",

    "source": "Spain Stings Argentina Over Nationalization of Repsol YPF <eos> MADRID — Spain said Friday that it would seek to restrict imports of biodiesel fuel from Argentina, its first retaliatory measure after the government in Buenos Aires decided to seize control of the assets there of Repsol YPF , the largest Spanish oil company. Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, the deputy prime minister, said Spain would seek to use Spanish and European biofuel instead of that of Argentina, which is the biggest exporter of biofuel to Spain. Madrid imports almost three-quarters of all its biofuel, with shipments from Argentina worth about €750 million, or $991 million, last year. Still, the measure fell short of the kind of hard-hitting sanctions that had been threatened by Spain. Several government ministers warned in recent days that Argentina’s decision was an act of aggression against Spain and would not go unpunished. Following a cabinet meeting in Madrid, Ms. Sáenz de Santamaría would not comment on what further actions might be taken by Madrid, nor even detail how the biofuel restrictions would be applied. The diplomatic tussle follows last Monday’s announcement by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner that Argentina would take back majority control of YPF, now 57 percent owned by Repsol. Even before the response from Madrid on Friday, her government played down the impact that such sanctions could have on Argentina. Repsol is planning to challenge the Argentine government before the international courts and seek at least $10.5 billion in compensation for the expropriation in what promises to be a lengthy legal battle. Matthew Parish, a Geneva-based international arbitration partner at the law firm Holman Fenwick Willan, noted that Argentina was already the world’s biggest defaulter on investment arbitration awards. The Spanish government has been studying what sanctions it could impose under the terms of a bilateral investment treaty signed with Argentina in 1991. However, trade lawyers have warned that Spain needed to consider the risks that any escalation in the conflict would present to the significant assets of other Spanish corporations operating in Argentina — a further reason to opt instead for sanctions at the European Union level. The Union is Argentina’s second-biggest export market after Brazil. The Union could, for instance, freeze ongoing talks about forming a free trade area with Argentina or suspend some trade concessions granted to the country. On Friday, lawmakers from the European Parliament approved a resolution urging the European Commission to remove such concessions on Argentine exports.",

    "source": "Witnesses Testify Espada Paid Own Expenses With Nonprofit’s Funds <eos> A videographer who was hired by former State Senator Pedro Espada Jr. to film a private birthday party testified on Thursday that she had been pressured by Mr. Espada’s assistant to lie about the work she performed and claim in an invoice that she had actually filmed a public event. The videographer, Evelyn Lopez, said in the federal trial of Mr. Espada, who is accused of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars from a nonprofit health care network on his private expenses, that she filmed the birthday party of Mr. Espada’s 1-year-old grandson in May 2007 and submitted an invoice to Mr. Espada that indicated as much. She later received an e-mail from Mr. Espada’s assistant at the time, Norma Ortiz. “The invoice sent needs revision,” said the e-mail from Ms. Ortiz, which Ms. Lopez read aloud from the stand. “Please correct and e-mail to me a.s.a.p.” In the e-mail, Ms. Ortiz asked that Ms. Lopez revise the invoice to indicate that Ms. Lopez had filmed a “children’s community outreach” event, not a birthday party. Ms. Lopez replied to that e-mail: “The invoice is correct. The event was in a private home.” Ms. Lopez’s e-mail continued, “So as you can see, I cannot change the invoice (it would be dishonest).” Ms. Lopez was one of more than a dozen witnesses who testified on Thursday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn that Mr. Espada paid them for personal services with business checks from Community Expansion Development Corporation, which prosecutors said was a subsidiary of the health care network, Soundview Health Care Network in the Bronx. According to the indictment against Mr. Espada and his son, Pedro Gautier Espada, who is also on trial, the Community Expansion Development Corporation , a for-profit janitorial services company incorporated by Mr. Espada, became a full subsidiary of Soundview in 2006. The indictment charged that Mr. Espada and his son continued to operate the company as if it still belonged to the elder Mr. Espada, operating solely for the benefit of him and his family. An administrator at Preston High School, an all-girls’ Catholic school in the Bronx, testified that Mr. Espada paid the tuition for Angelita Gonzalez, who prosecutors said was Mr. Espada’s niece, with a check from Community Expansion. The chief financial officer of Huntington Learning Center, an after-school tutoring program, said his company received payment from the same corporation. An administrator at St. John’s University, a lawyer who defended Mr. Espada in a libel case, an antique dealer and the ghostwriter who was to write Mr. Espada’s memoir all testified that they had been paid with the corporation’s checks. Lawyers for the Espadas have said that they were entitled to make the purchases and that they did not steal from Soundview. Donald MacLaren, the ghostwriter, said in an interview outside the courtroom that Mr. Espada had been motivated to write the memoir by a brewing rivalry with Eliot Spitzer, who was then the state attorney general. “He was afraid Spitzer was going to turn against him and it would turn into the same thing this is now,” Mr. MacLaren said, referring to the criminal trial.",

    "source": "Tar Heels’ Walk-On Has Taken His Lumps <eos> No one knows Tyler Hansbrough’s moves, or his temper, better than a mostly anonymous North Carolina teammate who has spent the past three years as his personal punching bag. Surry Wood has the cuts, bruises, stitches and concussion to prove it. But he has no complaints about a role that few will see, yet many envy. He is one of a handful of walk-ons on the North Carolina roster who spend each day being pounded by the regulars in practice and each night on the Tar Heels’ bench hoping for a blowout so he can spend a minute or two on the court. Wood and the rest of the so-called blue squad of walk-ons will have a front-row seat when the Tar Heels meet Kansas in the N.C.A.A. tournament semifinals Saturday night in San Antonio. And if all goes well, he may actually earn a line in the box score. But either way, he is content to have contributed to a team that may win a national championship. “I definitely feel like I’m a part of it,” Wood, a senior, said Tuesday as he sat in a chair on the sideline at Dean Smith Center. “Getting to prepare these guys every day, you definitely know you’re part of the program when you get to run out, put the jersey on.” That is the easy part. But it is not so easy in practice. Apparently, Hansbrough, a consensus all-American forward, does not have an off switch there, either. “Surry’s definitely taken his beatings,” Hansbrough said. “Every once in a while he’ll come to practice, we’re like, ‘Man, where’d you get that bruise, Surry?’ He goes: ‘It’s from you. The elbow you gave me the other day.’ But it’s Surry’s job. He’s there pushing us every day.” Wood is not allowed to hit back, though. He once received a stern warning when he accidentally elbowed Danny Green. No fouling Hansbrough, either. But Wood happily recalls the broken finger Hansbrough sustained while trying to guard him awhile back. “I don’t think he’ll ever be able to wear a ring,” Wood said. “I got him pretty good. He’ll always remember that.” Wood, who grew up in nearby Raleigh as a Tar Heels fan, played Division III basketball at Hampden-Sydney in Virginia for a season before transferring to North Carolina in 2004. Through tryouts against other students, he won a job on the junior-varsity squad four years ago and earned a spot on the varsity team in 2005-6. He has played 78 minutes in his career. But Wood has been rewarded for his efforts. Williams inserted him into the starting lineup on Senior Night in March — the only start of his career.

    "source": "To Keep or Kill? Lowly Leap Second Focus of World Debate <eos> On Thursday, the world will go to battle over a second. In Geneva, 700 delegates from about 70 nations attending a meeting of a United Nations telecommunications agency will decide whether to abolish the leap second. Unlike the better-known leap year, which adds a day to February in a familiar four-year cycle (with a few well-defined exceptions), the leap second is tacked on once every few years to synchronize atomic clocks — the world’s scientific timekeepers — with Earth ’s rotational cycle, which, sadly, does not run quite like clockwork. The next one is scheduled for June 30 (do not bother to adjust your watch). The United States is the primary proponent for doing away with the leap second, arguing that the sporadic adjustments, if botched or overlooked, could lead to major foul-ups if electronic systems that depend on the precise time — including computer and cellphone networks, air traffic control and financial trading markets — do not agree on the time. Abolishing the leap second “removes one potential source of catastrophic failure for the world’s computer networks,” said Geoff Chester, a spokesman for the United States Naval Observatory, the nation’s primary timekeeper. “That one second becomes a problem if you don’t take it into account.” But Britain, along with Canada and China, would like to keep the current keeping system, arguing that, in the 40 years that leap seconds have been gracefully inserted in our midst — most recently in 2008 — there have been no problems to speak of, and the worriers have greatly exaggerated the potential for havoc. Remember Y2K? “It’s the devil we know,” said Robert Seaman, a software engineer at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory. While he is an American, he is also a member of another group leery of the change: astronomers. If a software-guided telescope is not pointed in the right direction, it may not capture the right image, and updating software could be a sizable task. Defenders of the leap second would like to retain the quaint notion that the definition of a day has something to do with the rising and setting of the sun. Since the 1950s, the world has run on two sets of clocks. One is the ticking of atomic clocks, defined by the precise frequency that electrons jump around in atoms. The other is based on the traditional notion of a spinning Earth. If the leap second is stamped out, the astronomical definition of time will diverge from what is dictated by the atomic clocks, about a couple of thousandths of a second a day, growing to a minute over the course of a century, and someday — thousands of years from now — noon will strike at sunrise instead of when the sun is overhead. The problem is a distinctly modern one. Only a few centuries ago, people set their watches by the clock in the town square, and the time in each town was different from the next. That mattered little, since there was no need or ability to communicate with anyone elsewhere in the world. Railroads changed the situation, creating the need to set cross-country schedules. This in turn led to the creation of time zones, synchronizing time across large swaths. But the length of a day and a second remained tied to the rotation of Earth. In 1967, the nations of the world changed things around, creating a new definition of a second based on atomic clocks and pegged to the length of an astronomical day in 1900. But Earth, like any spinning top, has slowed down since 1900, and the time between sunrise and sunset has grown longer. Atomic clocks now run slightly ahead of what is defined in the sky, and, starting in 1972, leap seconds have been added to keep the two sets of clocks synchronized. A panel of experts at the International Telecommunication Union, an arm of the United Nations, began discussions eight years ago, but could not come to a consensus to keep or get rid of them. The United States and Britain have been butting heads over the issue over most of that time. “What it decided was to give the baby to the higher levels,” said François Rancy, director of the union’s radio communication bureau. Discussions are continuing between the United States and Britain, and Mr. Rancy said he hoped the two could finally come to a consensus in the hours before that agenda item is reached. But if necessary, the proposal to eliminate leap seconds would be put to a vote of the delegates. In a poll conducted by the union last year, only 16 nations expressed an opinion. Thirteen would abolish leap seconds. Three wanted to keep them. If approved, the recommendation would still have to be ratified by a larger meeting next month. Regardless, there will be one extra second to enjoy this summer. The change would not take effect until 2018.",

    "source": "The Dog That’s Stealing Asians’ Hearts <eos> In the cramped metropolises of East Asia, brown toy poodles have become the latest must-have accessory. They amble down Chinese streets in sweaters, bow ties and dinosaur costumes. They are so popular in Tottori, Japan, that the police force has added two female toy poodles, Fuga and Karin , to its ranks. In China, the pets are known as “taidi,” a riff on the English word “teddy.” So, why toy poodles? And why brown? Chinese poodle-lovers described the breed as smart, easygoing and humanlike in personality. They said the coffee-colored coats set these pups apart from other poodles and made it easy to conceal grime from the street. In the hygiene-obsessed cities of East Asia, there is another perk: Toy poodles are known for shedding very little hair. “I regard her as one of my family,” said Xu Chen, 25, a flight attendant from Beijing whose poodle, Ceicei, is clean, cuddly and low maintenance. “She’s very beautiful and smart.” Dogs were once dismissed as a bourgeois luxury in China, and large pets are still banned in parts of some major cities . That has led to a boom in the market for small dogs, with toy poodles selling for several hundred dollars each. Of the roughly 950,000 dogs in Beijing last year, more than 13 percent, or about 125,000, were toy poodles, according to the Beijing Kennel Club. They outnumbered other breeds like the bichon frisé, the golden retriever and the Welsh corgi. Shen Ruihong, who leads the kennel club, said demand for toy poodles in China surged several years ago after a craze in Japan. Toy poodles started showing up on popular television programs, and soon “they went viral,” he said, especially among the young women who fuel so many fads. “The more people who raised them, the more people who wanted them,” he said. “Now we have too many.”",

    "source": "Henrik Lundqvist Has 48 Saves in Rangers’ 4-1 Win Over Carolina <eos> RALEIGH, N.C. — If the Rangers needed a breather after back-to-back games against Eastern Conference-leading Pittsburgh and before two critical meetings with Toronto this week, the schedule offered this kindness on Saturday night: a trip to Carolina. The fading Hurricanes had lost 10 of their last 11 games and had to play without the injured Alexander Semin, their second-leading scorer. With every point crucial in their battle with the Islanders and the Devils for the final two playoff berths in the East, these were 2 points the Rangers needed to bank. And they did, with a 4-1 victory over a Carolina team that turned out to be far from a pushover. Henrik Lundqvist saved the Rangers, stopping a season-high 48 shots, and a three-goal burst in the second period allowed them to come away with their third victory in four games. Derek Stepan, Ryan Callahan and Rick Nash scored in the decisive second period, with Brian Boyle adding an empty-net goal in the final second of the game. The Rangers and the Islanders remained tied in points in the race for the final two playoff spots. They each have 42 points, but the Rangers are in seventh because they hold a tiebreaker. The Islanders defeated Tampa Bay, 4-2, on Saturday. The Devils fell 3 points back after a 2-1 loss to Toronto. Lundqvist had 14 saves for the Rangers in what could have been a disastrous first period, and he kept the Hurricanes from coming back in the third with 20 more saves. He has allowed two goals or fewer in each of the last 10 games. “That’s the best I’ve seen him play since I’ve been here,” Rangers Coach John Tortorella said. “He stole us one. I thought we had a good second period, but first and third we were nowhere to be found.” Perhaps, but the Rangers seem to have found their game of late. That is at least in part because of the recent additions of Ryane Clowe, Derick Brassard, Mats Zuccarello and John Moore. “It’s a different atmosphere in the room,” Lundqvist said. “Not only did we get some really skilled players, but it changed the dynamic in the room where you get the new guys.” He added, “It’s just a lot better feeling in here.” The Rangers scored twice in 31 seconds early in the second period to pull away. Brad Richards set up Stepan in the slot, and he broke a scoreless tie with a power-play goal two minutes into the period. Moments later, Carolina goalie Dan Ellis was caught out of the net trying to play the puck along the end boards. Nash poked it away, sending it to Callahan in front for an easy goal into the open net. Nash added a power-play goal at 11 minutes 19 seconds when he stickhandled through the slot, turned around and wristed a low shot past Ellis. The Rangers were 2 of 5 on the power play. “We knew they were coming and we didn’t weather it too well in the first, but we did create some chances, too,” Richards said. “The second, it was important to bury some goals and we did, and then Hank took us home.” Lundqvist lost his shutout bid when Zac Dalpe buried a one-timer from the slot at 9:27 of the third. It was the only blemish on a busy, busy night. “I’m just so tired I don’t know what to say right now,” Lundqvist said. “I’m exhausted.” Slap Shots Hurricanes centers Eric and Jordan Staal are now wearing visors on their helmets after the injury to their brother Marc Staal, the Rangers defenseman who has been out since March 5 after a puck hit him near the right eye. The Staals had resisted wearing visors, but put them on for the first time March 26 against Winnipeg. ... The Hurricanes’ Alexander Semin was out with an upper-body injury. ... Rangers defenseman Michael Del Zotto did not face league discipline for what he called an inadvertent elbow to the jaw of Pittsburgh wing James Neal on Friday in the Penguins’ 2-1 shootout victory. Neal was dazed by the blow and did not return to the game. Del Zotto said Saturday morning that he had not been contacted by the N.H.L. for a disciplinary hearing, and he was in the lineup Saturday night.",

    "source": "From the Valley Comes a Warning <eos> From the Valley Comes a Warning Maybe it was the tombstone that did it. Even as Wall Street burned, Silicon Valley seemed strangely sanguine. Then a PowerPoint presentation from Sequoia Capital prophesying Armageddon — featuring an “R.I.P. Good Times” headstone — made the rounds. A month later, venture capital firms are slashing investments and counseling portfolio companies to cut jobs. Sequoia’s warning may reflect the technology industry’s woes, but it’s more notable for what it says about venture capital. Maybe it’s because venture capital’s traditional gravy train — initial public offerings of fast-growing start-ups — had slowed. That, coupled with the severity of the 2000 dot-com crash, gave the industry a false sense of immunity to financial hard times. Then came the Sequoia document. The firm — which had financed Apple, Google and Yahoo — showed its portfolio companies a presentation on why this financial crisis could be the worst yet and advised survival tactics like layoffs. The presentation burned across Silicon Valley like wildfire. When one of the most successful firms moves in a club known for herdlike behavior, everyone takes notice. Other investors, like Benchmark Capital, advised their companies to conserve cash. Layoffs began en masse. Sequoia-backed LinkedIn and Zappos both chopped their staffs, as have big public companies like Yahoo and Sun Microsystems. Since the Sequoia presentation in October, there have been nearly 50,000 layoffs in the technology sector, according to a running counter on the blog TechCrunch. Sequoia’s viral hit underscores the precariousness of the venture capital business. Venture-backed exits have fallen 54 percent so far this year. And with the I.P.O. market shut, that has left mergers and acquisitions as the primary value driver. Yet with financing near impossible, even the historical safety of being swallowed by a Cisco or Google has disappeared. Like Wall Street banks, hedge funds and private equity, the venture capital industry got too fat. Firms currently manage $260 billion, according to the National Venture Capital Association, 14 percent more than during the bubble, and the industry now raises more money than it creates. A shakeout was inevitable. It’s just odd that it took Sequoia’s PowerPoint to get it under way. A Pension Portfolio No wonder private equity, hedge fund and venture capital fund managers are biting their fingernails. As the stock market holdings of some of their big pension fund investors have plunged, the proportion that these so-called alternative investments comprise as a portion of their overall portfolios has ballooned. That’s a problem. Take the California Public Employees’ Retirement System — the biggest pension fund. Calpers, which will discuss its asset allocation at an investment meeting on Monday, had its portfolio thrown out of whack by the global equity mess. The fund aims to have about 56 percent of its $200 billion in equities, and 9.5 percent in alternative investments. The rest goes to bonds, real estate, inflation-linked assets and cash. But because equities slid so drastically in the past month, Calpers is now overinvested in these riskier and less liquid alternative assets. Today they account for 14 percent of the portfolio. Since private equity and venture capital firms typically collect money over several years from pension funds — which make commitments upfront to various funds — the weighting is likely to increase even further. Calpers can hope that equity markets will rebound before it is asked to follow its capital commitments. That’s no sure thing. Calpers could try to turn down future fund raisings — but it would surely be penalized by the fund managers for doing so. It could sell other assets to cough up the cash, but that might force it to take big losses. Barring any of these options, for Calpers to follow its money and realign its allocation model, it will need to pass the hat back around to the state workers it serves — and ask for more money. This puts the pressure further down the chain, particularly if it forces the fund's working members to raise their contributions. In theory, asset allocation models are meant to mitigate risk through diversification. If one bucket, say equities, falls, then the fixed-income or private equity investments should offset the decline. But when markets fall more or less in tandem, the model not only fails but also puts other assets at risk of the capital needs of others. So much for theory.

    "source": "U.S. Jets to Use Turkish Bases in War on ISIS <eos> ISTANBUL — Turkey plunged into the fight against the Islamic State on Thursday, rushing forces into the first direct combat with its militants on the Syrian border and granting permission for American warplanes to use two Turkish air bases for bombarding the group in Syria . The developments ended a longstanding reluctance by Turkey, a NATO member and an ally of the United States, to play a more aggressive part in halting the Islamic State’s expanding reach in the Middle East. American officials said it carried the potential to strike Islamic State targets with far greater effect because of Turkey’s proximity, which will allow more numerous and frequent bombings and surveillance missions. Turkey, a vital conduit for the Islamic State’s power base in Syria, had come under increased criticism for its inability — or unwillingness — to halt the flow of foreign fighters and supplies across its 500-mile border. Up to now, Turkey has placed a priority on dealing with its own restive Kurdish population, which straddles the Syrian border in the southeast, and in the toppling of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, whom the Turks blame for creating the conditions in his war-ravaged country for the rise of Islamic extremism. But now that extremism has increasingly menaced Turkey, where 1.5 million Syrian war refugees have also been straining the country. A series of Islamic State attacks on Turks, including a devastating suicide bombing a few days ago that officials have linked to the extremist group, may also have helped accelerate the shift in Turkey’s position. Turkish internal security officials had signaled their growing concern about the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, with a series of large-scale raids in the past few weeks, detaining hundreds of suspected ISIS members and sympathizers. Taking the fight to the Islamic State in Syria, however, represents a huge leap. “The terrorist organization represents a national security threat to Turkey, and we are working closely with our allies, including the United States, to combat terrorism,” said a senior official in the prime minister’s office. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of government protocol restrictions, also emphasized that Turkey had not changed its position regarding Mr. Assad in Syria. In what Turkish officials described as the first direct cross-border confrontation with the Islamic State, Turkish jets scrambled as tanks and artillery of its Fifth Armored Brigade shelled militants across the border. And early Friday, Turkish fighter jets hit four Islamic State targets within Syria, across the border from Kilis Province, without crossing into Syria, a Turkish security official said, according to Reuters. Obama administration officials, who have been negotiating with Turkey for months, said Thursday that they had reached an agreement for manned and unmanned American warplanes to carry out aerial attacks on Islamic State positions from air bases at Incirlik and Diyarbakir. The agreement was described by one senior administration official as a “game changer.” How ISIS Expands The Islamic State aims to build a broad colonial empire across many countries. The agreement was sealed on Wednesday with a phone call between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Obama, another administration official said. Turkey had allowed unarmed surveillance flights from Incirlik but had thus far balked at anything more muscular. Officials at the State Department and the Pentagon said they were hesitant to talk about the pact until the Turkish government acknowledged it publicly. Turkish officials declined to comment on the pact Thursday night. The United States and Turkey “have decided to further deepen our cooperation in the fight against ISIL,” the State Department’s spokesman, John Kirby, said in a statement. He said that “due to operational security I don’t have further details to share at this time.” The clash between Turkey’s armed forces and the Islamic State came after gunmen identified by the Turkish military as Islamic State fighters fired on a Turkish border outpost in the Kilis region, killing one Turkish soldier and wounding five. The Turkish military said in a statement that its border shelling was a response, and that at least one militant was killed. Turkish news media said a number of Islamic State vehicles were obliterated in the shelling. The clash came three days after a suicide bomber with suspected ties to the Islamic State struck a cultural center in the Turkish border town of Suruc, killing 32 people. Obama administration officials said the United States had agreed to work with European allies, including Germany, France and Britain, to do more to control their end of the flow of foreign fighters crossing Turkey to reach Syria. Acknowledging that commitment to Turkey, Mr. Kirby said the United States recognized that “the foreign fighter problem is not Turkey’s alone.” It was unclear what other concessions might have been made by the United States to conclude the deal, but a NATO official said on Thursday that “the Turks always drive a hard bargain.” The breakthrough came after recent talks between Gen. John R. Allen, a retired Marine who is Mr. Obama’s special envoy for the fight against the Islamic State, and Turkish counterparts. General Allen’s trip was preceded by a telephone call from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to Mr. Erdogan, administration officials said. Obama's Evolution on ISIS Some of President Obama’s statements about the American strategy to confront ISIS and its effectiveness. A senior Defense Department official said recent Islamic State attacks on Turkish targets had played an important role in Turkey’s decision to join the fight against the militant group directly. “Attacks in Turkey are part of the catalyst for them to think about how they get in the game,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. For the Pentagon, the Turkish decision is huge because the two air bases are much closer to the Syrian border than Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan and the Persian Gulf, where strikes had been launched. The agreement will significantly increase the amount of time that American spy planes can hover over Syria. In addition, it will accelerate the response time for manned flights acting on intelligence information. But even as they were lauding the agreement, American military officials were cautious because they felt that they had been burned by Turkey before. In 2003, Defense Department officials believed that they had an agreement with the Turks to send the Army’s Fourth Infantry Division into northern Iraq from Turkey as part of the invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein. But the Turkish Parliament refused to grant permission and the division’s equipment remained offshore on ships. While the United States shares Turkey’s antipathy for Mr. Assad, the Turks had previously insisted on a no-fly zone in northern Syria, near the border with Turkey, in exchange for allowing the United States to use their bases. A no-fly zone would create a safe area to arm and train moderate rebels fighting Mr. Assad and allow an opposition government to take root. The United States has largely opposed this because it would broaden Mr. Obama’s stated objective of focusing only on the destruction of the Islamic State; however, some within the government, especially at the State Department, believe the idea should be given serious consideration. Asked on Thursday at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado whether a no-fly zone was part of the deal with Turkey, General Allen said: “No. It was not part of the discussion.” He referred all other questions about the agreement to officials in Washington. Other administration officials said the growing Islamic State threat to Turkey as well as Mr. Assad’s shrinking control over territory in Syria had prompted the Turks to drop the condition — at least for now. “The agreement seems a watershed moment in terms of airstrikes,” said Andrew J. Tabler, an expert on Arab politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. But for the Turkish government, Mr. Tabler said: “ISIS is just one manifestation of state collapse in Syria. Solving it is getting Assad out of Damascus.”",

    "source": "Impassively, Knicks’ Amar’e Stoudemire Describes His Accident <eos> GREENBURGH, N.Y. — To Amar’e Stoudemire it was all an accident, a momentary swipe of his left hand in the frustrating wake of a dispiriting defeat. In his words, he meant to “make some noise,” not summon paramedics and several days of censure. As his Knicks teammates practiced Wednesday, Stoudemire contended that Monday night’s self-inflicted hand injury — caused when he broke the glass partly enclosing a fire extinguisher — was a case of bad timing. It was an unfortunate mishap, with blood and screaming headlines to follow. “I didn’t, in a million years, expect to hurt myself,” said Stoudemire, who will not play Thursday in Game 3 against the Miami Heat. “Who would want to hurt himself in the playoffs?” With his left hand wrapped in a thick, soft bandage, Stoudemire seemed neither embarrassed nor distraught. He addressed reporters in a matter-of-fact tone that was a mix of unsupported hopefulness — he said he had a great chance to play in Sunday’s Game 4 — and detached bewilderment. It all happened, Stoudemire said, so fast. “I was walking down the corridor frustrated that we were down, 0-2, and I swung my arm at the wall,” Stoudemire said, describing the episode. “The fire extinguisher door was 85 percent metal and 2 percent glass, or whatever. I didn’t see the glass. I swung my arm backward. It wasn’t like I had a closed fist and punched the glass. I was letting off a little frustration — trying to make some noise, not injure myself. “When I saw that I my hand was cut, I was like, what? I was very upset and upset with myself. But never in a million years did I think I would cut my hand.” Stoudemire was disappointed that he would not be able to help his teammates Thursday — he said he had let them down — but added that he believed he could play in Sunday’s game. The Knicks list him as doubtful for Game 4. “I’m expecting to heal up fast,” Stoudemire said. “I think there’s a great chance I can play Sunday.” Knicks Coach Mike Woodson, however, was not planning on Stoudemire’s return. “I wait until the doctors tell me who’s ready,” Woodson said. “It’s not something I can undo. You don’t expect something like this to happen, but over the years, I’ve seen players do strange things.” Woodson added that Stoudemire was apologetic, although according to his teammates, there was no formal apology to the team. Nor was one sought. “He doesn’t have to apologize to me,” Steve Novak said after an unusually long practice session. “I know Amar’e wouldn’t do anything to hurt the team.” Carmelo Anthony said he talked on the telephone with Stoudemire on Tuesday, the day after the incident. “He feels bad and we talked about it,” Anthony said. “Right now, all I care about is him getting healthy.” At times Wednesday, Stoudemire appeared to be rationalizing the injury, as if to say he was an unlucky victim. “Everybody gets upset at times,” he said. “People knock over ice coolers or kick a chair or a table. It was accidental that I struck the glass. I just swung my arm backward.” Asked about fan reaction to the incident and criticism he has received, Stoudemire said: “I understand the fans are frustrated, and I am, too. But they have the wrong perception of what happened. I wasn’t trying to hurt myself and I didn’t punch a glass window. It was nothing like that.” After Stoudemire left the Knicks’ practice, and after his teammates and coaches faced 20 minutes of questioning about the chaotic Monday night postgame scene, the mood around the team suddenly changed to something a little more uplifting. In an elaborate ceremony broadcast nationally by the N.B.A., center Tyson Chandler was named the league’s defensive player of the year — the first Knick to win the award. Chandler, signed as a free agent before this season, said he was especially happy to be recognized because he is not among the top players in either blocked shots or steals. “I play defense by being in the right position and in many other fundamental and not always flashy ways,” he said. “So I’m glad that was recognized. I’ve always wanted to be considered one of the top defensive players in the league. But the defensive player of the year often goes to a big name. It’s just a dream for it to come my way.” The defensive work of Chandler and his teammates will have to be at its best Thursday against Miami. Much of the Knicks’ lineup is in flux. Woodson said Anthony would shift to power forward, where he played recently, and sometimes thrived, when Stoudemire was sidelined with a back injury, but was undecided about whom to start at small forward. “Whoever plays, we’re going to need a big push from everyone on the court,” Woodson said. “But I’m not unnerved by this situation. We’ve got a legitimate chance on our home court. We’ll see what we’re made of.” REBOUNDS Point guard Jeremy Lin participated in a full-court three-on-three pickup game after practice. Wearing a brace on his surgically repaired left knee, Lin looked fluid and ran without a limp. “This is the first time he’s been able to run up and down,” Mike Woodson said. “The question is: Can he defend? Can he cut on the knee? We’ll wait and see how he feels. He’s talked about wanting to play but it’s up to a decision by the doctors.” ... The Knicks announced that Iman Shumpert had knee surgery and would need six to eight months to recover.",

    "source": "Ex-Chief of Viacom Joins the Time Warner Dissidents <eos> Carl C. Icahn said yesterday that he had recruited Frank J. Biondi Jr., the former chief executive of Viacom and Universal Studios, to become Time Warner's chairman and chief executive if Mr. Icahn prevailed in a planned proxy fight for control of the media giant. Mr. Icahn, the billionaire financier, has been staging a battle to replace the board of Time Warner, where his fund and various others own about 3 percent of the stock. He has told other funds that he believes Time Warner's stock could be worth about $27 a share. Time Warner rose 26 cents yesterday to close at $17.55 a share. But Mr. Icahn's push has met with relatively little reaction on Wall Street, where his proposals to split off Time Warner's cable unit, replace top management, trim expenses and increase the share repurchase program have failed to generate much investor excitement. \"Desperate men do desperate things,\" said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, of Mr. Icahn's decision to bring Mr. Biondi on board. \"Despite Mr. Icahn's investment, we don't see $27 or $28 a share of value at Time Warner unless the company is broken up in its entirety, and that does not appear to be imminent.\" A spokesman for Time Warner, Edward I. Adler, said that \"our management, Dick Parsons and Jeff Bewkes, has restored the company to health and put it on a growth track,\" referring to the company's chief executive and its president. \"Beyond that, we do not have a comment on Mr. Biondi.\" In a filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Icahn said that Mr. Biondi would be paid at least $6 million if the Icahn slate failed to win and at least $10 million if the slate was elected. In the filing Mr. Icahn also responded to a recent article in The Wall Street Journal that was critical of his efforts at Time Warner. Mr. Icahn wrote that his efforts had already resulted in the company's going forward with a $12 billion stock repurchase plan. He also reiterated criticism of Mr. Parsons's management, which he said had failed to maximize shareholder value. Mr. Biondi, 61, is a well-known and well-liked figure in the media industry, though his career has had setbacks. In 1998, he was ousted by Seagram's chief executive, Edgar Bronfman Jr., in part because Universal Studios, the company's film division, had fared poorly. Two years earlier, he was pushed out as chief executive of Viacom. At that time, associates said that Sumner M. Redstone, Viacom's controlling shareholder, was unhappy because in his view Mr. Biondi had not managed the company aggressively enough. Other company executives said that Mr. Redstone simply wanted to take more direct control over the company. \"This seems an odd choice,\" said Leo J. Hindery Jr., managing partner of InterMedia Partners, a media private equity firm. \"One of the reasons that Mr. Redstone let him go was because he was not an aggressive enough manager, and Mr. Icahn has stated that that is precisely what he is looking for.\" Mr. Biondi did not quite see it that way. \"If you want someone to get up and shout and scream, that is not me,\" Mr. Biondi said in a telephone interview yesterday. \"If you want someone who knows the businesses and knows what can be done with them, that is me.\" Since Mr. Biondi left Universal in 1998, he has been one of the partners in WaterView Advisors, a $150 million private equity firm that specializes in the media. He is also on the board of the Cablevision Systems Corporation. Mr. Biondi was brought into the Time Warner fight by his brother, Michael J.

He is being positioned to implement the plan now being drawn up by Mr. Icahn and his bankers at Lazard Freres. The plan is far more important than Frank Biondi. The question is whether the plan will have enough meat to generate investor support.\"",

    "source": "Whistle-Blowing Insiders: ‘Game Changer’ for the S.E.C. <eos> Although there have been many complaints about the Dodd-Frank Act, one area generally hailed as a success is the whistle-blowing program at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since the program’s creation in 2011, the S.E.C. has received more than 14,000 tips, including almost 4,000 last year. That number falls well short of the original estimate of 30,000 submissions each year, but quality is far more important than quantity. Not surprisingly, agency officials heap praise on the program. Mary Jo White, the S.E.C. chairwoman, called it “a game changer for the agency,” while the director of the enforcement division, Andrew J. Ceresney, said that whistle-blowers “had a transformative impact.” Figuring out how well a program is doing is always difficult because the sponsor has every reason to claim success. As the scandal caused by Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme shows, it is as much a matter of taking whistle-blowers seriously as it is getting them in the door. Five years into the program, it is clear that some of the best information comes from corporate insiders. They can give the S.E.C. a map to how a firm operates and where to look for wrongdoing. A $22 million award to an internal whistle-blower at Monsanto announced last week is a good example of the impact an internal whistle-blower can have in showing the S.E.C. where there may be problems inside a company. Monsanto in February settled charges of violating accounting rules related to the recording of the costs of a rebate program for Roundup, one of its leading consumer products. The company offered rebates to its distributors to increase sales but shifted those costs into the next fiscal year. By not recognizing the expenses right away, it was able to push up its revenue while delaying the reduction caused by recognizing the costs, something that investors would certainly want to know in evaluating how a company is doing. Accounting shenanigans are notoriously difficult to uncover, especially for a company like Monsanto, which has annual sales of more than $10 billion and multiple product lines. The amount of the rebates was comparatively small, less than $100 million over two years, so it is unlikely it would have been noticed by the S.E.C. without a whistle-blower saying where to look. The agency knows well that accounting problems at a company usually start small and then can grow to take on a life of their own, so catching a violation early on is the best way to keep a business from veering into bigger problems. In announcing the $22 million award , which is one of the largest given by the commission, the head of the whistle-blower office, Jane A. Norberg, said that “without this whistle-blower’s courage, information and assistance, it would have been extremely difficult for law enforcement to discover this securities fraud on its own.” When the rules for the whistle-blower program were first announced, companies objected that there was no requirement for an employee to report wrongdoing internally before providing information to the agency. Internal whistle-blowers account for nearly half of those receiving awards, and the S.E.C.’s most recent annual report to Congress on the program notes that 80 percent of them either reported their concerns to management or said that the corporate compliance office was aware of the issue. The internal whistle-blower presents a real threat to a company, not only from the S.E.C., but also from the Justice Department, because any violation of the securities law can result in a criminal prosecution. The winding-down of Visium Asset Management, a multibillion-dollar hedge fund, shows how a disgruntled former employee who goes to the government can wreak havoc on a firm. Stefan Lumiere, a former portfolio manager at Visium, was charged in June with a scheme to mismark securities held in a credit fund that he helped manage, which invested in the debt securities of health care companies. He is accused of inflating the value of the investments and not identifying how some were highly illiquid. His boss, Christopher Plaford, has already pleaded guilty to securities fraud and insider trading charges, and is cooperating in the case. A major feature of the government’s case against Mr. Lumiere are recordings made by a junior trader at the firm of more than 125 conversations with colleagues, totaling almost 200 hours, after agreeing to cooperate in the investigation. Visium itself has not been charged with any wrongdoing. The indictment calls the trader “CC-1,” the typical nomenclature for a cooperating co-conspirator, who Bloomberg News reported is Jason Thorell. According to an affidavit filed by a F.B.I. agent, Mr. Thorell received immunity from prosecution and the case “could indirectly result in a financial benefit” to him. The S.E.C. filed a parallel lawsuit against Mr. Lumiere and Mr. Plaford, so the financial benefit is likely to come from a whistle-blower claim Mr. Thorell might have for providing information that led to the cases. The prerequisite to receiving a whistle-blower award is that the S.E.C. will recover more than $1 million from enforcement actions based on the information provided, so any payment will have to await the resolution of the cases. At the Justice Department’s request, the S.E.C. lawsuit against Mr. Lumiere has been delayed until the criminal charges are resolved. One factor that could increase an award, which can range from 10 to 30 percent of any monetary sanctions recovered, is whether the case involves an area that is an agency priority, such as misconduct involving a regulated entity or an industrywide practice. That certainly applies to this case, because the S.E.C. has been focusing its attention recently on how hedge funds value illiquid investments, and Visium was an investment adviser that owed a fiduciary duty to its clients. Any claim Mr. Thorell makes as a whistle-blower raises the interesting question about whether someone who participates in wrongdoing can receive an award. Mr. Thorell, according to Bloomberg, helped obtain sham quotes used to inflate the price of the securities in the Visium credit fund that were an important part of the mismarking, so he was in the middle of any violations. The answer is that even a violator can receive an award, but it may be reduced or denied based on the person’s level of involvement in the violations. Under the S.E.C. rules , a whistle-blower’s “role in the securities violations” and whether the person financially benefited from the conduct can be taken into consideration in the final decision. As is often the case, the best information comes from someone involved in the misconduct who left the company and may hope to cash in by turning over information to the government. The S.E.C. may be willing to overlook the acts of a lower-level trader in deciding how much it might give if the recovery exceeds $1 million. The S.E.C. no doubt hopes that large awards will draw the attention of corporate employees who can provide information; for some, the awards are almost like winning the lottery. The $22 million payment to the Monsanto employee is the second-largest in the history of the program, after a $30 million award in September 2014. But much like buying a Powerball ticket, the chances of scoring a big whistle-blower award appear to be quite low, at least when one considers the number of tips the agency receives and the likelihood that it will lead the S.E.C. to obtain a significant recovery from a company. Just as important, not every internal whistle-blower is in it for the money. Eric Ben-Artzi, a former risk manager at Deutsche Bank, turned down an $8.25 million award for information he provided about how the bank inflated the value of its credit derivatives portfolio during the financial crisis that resulted in the payment of a $55 million penalty in May 2015. In an op-ed article in The Financial Times on Aug. 19, he said that the bank and its shareholders were the victims of the misconduct by having to pay the fine while “top executives retired with multimillion-dollar bonuses based on the misrepresentation of the bank’s balance sheet.” Mr. Ben-Artzi’s refusal signals that whistle-blowing has truly come of age when someone shows that it is more than just the potential reward that motivates the revelation of misconduct. That sends a signal to companies that wrongdoing in the ranks will not go unnoticed for long, with the S.E.C.’s awards an additional motivation.",

    "source": "Not to Be, Um, Trifled With, Texas Guards Its Slogans <eos> HOUSTON — Don’t mess with Texas. In fact, don’t even mess with “Don’t Mess With Texas.” The trademarked slogan started out nearly 30 years ago as the clarion call of a campaign to reduce highway littering. But over the years it has become something far bigger: an identity statement, a declaration of Texas swagger — from barrooms to sports arenas to political conventions. And Texas is touchy about who uses it and how. In July, a Montana company that makes Western-themed accessories stopped selling a “Don’t Mess With Texas” belt buckle after the Texas Department of Transportation, which owns the federally registered trademark on the phrase, threatened legal action and told the firm to ship the offending merchandise to Austin. The author of a romance novel titled “Don’t Mess With Texas,” “a thrill ride of hunky heroes, hilarious high jinks and heartwarming romance,” found herself in a legal battle with the state after it filed a lawsuit in a federal court in Austin alleging trademark infringement. Days before the book was to be released, the state’s lawyers asked a judge to prohibit it from being sold while the case was under way. The judge denied the state’s request, but Texas ultimately won a dispute that dragged for nearly nine months. The suit was settled last year, and the author, Christie Craig, agreed to pay Texas $2,500 and change the book’s title. “Don’t Mess With Texas” became “Only in Texas.” Image The slogan “Don’t Mess With Texas” began as part of a campaign to curb highway littering. Credit Michael Stravato for The New York Times In a state whose governor likes to point out that Houston was the first word spoken on the moon, it should come as no surprise that Texas not only invented its most famous catchphrase, but that it also fights to ensure that catchphrase is used to the state’s satisfaction. Texas officials say they want to prevent “Don’t Mess With Texas” from losing its original antilittering message and protect the authorized use of its trademark. But others say that the state has been overzealous and that it is seeking to control a phrase so popular and well worn that people now associate it more with tough Texans than with litterbugs. It is used wherever and whenever Texans want to claim superiority or victory or simply boast of a Texan’s Texasness. Federal prosecutors say it at news conferences after announcing a big indictment. The Navy made it the motto of the U.S.S. Texas submarine at Pearl Harbor. Since 2000, Texas transportation officials have contacted more than 100 companies, organizations and individuals about the unauthorized use of the phrase, often in the form of strongly worded cease-and-desist letters that warn violators to either stop using the slogan or obtain licensing for it for a fee. (New York, of course, with its often-imitated “I ♥ NY” logo, has threatened hundreds more, sending out roughly 350 cease-and-desist letters since 2008.) But Texas has been just as protective of another popular phrase: “Remember the Alamo.” The state and its General Land Office , which oversees the historic site in San Antonio, registered “the Alamo” as a trademark, and it has claimed common-law rights, a more limited type of trademark protection that does not require federal registration, on “Remember the Alamo.” Last year, a San Antonio bar owner tried to register the phrase “I Can’t Remember the Alamo,” hoping to plaster it on T-shirts, mugs and even underwear. Image The state’s Transportation Department is protective of its trademark. Credit TxDOT Texas opposed the bar owner’s trademark application, arguing that it would lead consumers to believe it was sponsored by the General Land Office and that it tarnished the state “by communicating that the heroism and sacrifice undertaken by its forebears is not worthy of memory or esteem,” the agency wrote to the trademark appeals board. Texas won that fight, too: “I Can’t Remember the Alamo” underwear was never sold because the bar owner, Christopher Erck, abandoned the trademark application. “It got fairly heated, I will say that,” Mark Dallas Loeffler, the communications director for the General Land Office, said of the dispute. “In the end, I think he realized it was probably more trouble than it was worth just to sell a shirt. In our opinion, it was a victory for the State of Texas. The people of Texas should have the right to protect the phrases that are iconic to Texas.” To protect “Don’t Mess With Texas,” state transportation officials and lawyers monitor what they call “the usage of the brand.” The slogan was coined in 1985 by Tim McClure, a native Texan and a founder of GSD&M , an advertising agency based in Austin and hired by the state to help its antilittering campaign reach the worst highway offenders — men under 25. The phrase gave rise to a state-sponsored Web site, a book (“Don’t Mess With Texas: The Story Behind the Legend”), a Twitter account , television advertisements, bumper stickers and trash cans, all of which, if you look carefully enough, are emblazoned with the tiny encircled “R” that signifies a registered trademark. “The phrase is known around the world, and it is important for everyone to recognize that ‘Don’t Mess With Texas®’ means ‘Don’t litter,’ ” Veronica Beyer, a Transportation Department spokeswoman, said in a statement. “When an alleged infringement is discovered, the department quickly seeks the appropriate legal remedy, which is usually a cease-and-desist demand of the unauthorized use and all future uses thereof. In the majority of such cases, our request for the violator to cease and desist has been all the action required.” One group should not worry about using the phrase, however. The state’s politicians never tire of dropping it into speeches. As governor, George W. Bush used it in his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination in 2000, and the state’s attorney general, Greg Abbott, recently used it when campaigning for governor. State and federal law allow for trademarked phrases to be used in political speech, said Megan M. Carpenter, the director of the Center for Law and Intellectual Property at the Texas A&M University School of Law in Fort Worth. Gov. Rick Perry traveled to New York in June to try to lure businesses to Texas. A television ad tied to his trip that criticized New York as a high-tax, high-regulation state — paid for by the marketing group TexasOne , which also paid for the governor’s trip — tweaked the trademarked “I ♥ NY” logo to read “NY ♥ regulations.” New York, so far, has let it slide.",

    "source": "In Syria, Protesters and Government Mobilize for Friday <eos> BEIRUT, Lebanon — Syria deployed police officers, soldiers and military vehicles in two of the country’s three largest cities on Thursday ahead of a call for nationwide protests that will test the popular reception of reforms decreed by President Bashar al-Assad as well as the momentum that organizers have sought to bring to a five-week uprising. Residents described a mobilization in the capital, Damascus, and, in more pronounced fashion, in the restive city of Homs, where a government crackdown this week dispersed one of the largest gatherings since demonstrations began last month. For days, organizers have looked to Friday as a potential show of strength for a movement that has yet to build the critical mass reached in Egypt and Tunisia . “Together toward freedom,” read a Facebook page that has served as a pulpit of the uprising, the words posed over symbols of Christianity and Islam. “One heart, one hand, one goal.” The aim of both sides is the same: to prove they have the upper hand in the biggest challenge yet to the 40-year rule of the Assad family. While organizers were reluctant to call Friday a decisive moment, they acknowledged that it would signal their degree of support in a country that remained divided, with the government still claiming bastions of support among minorities, loyalists of the Baath Party and wealthier segments of the population. “People are still hesitant,” said Wissam Tarif, the executive director of Insan, a human rights group. But he added, “If it’s not this Friday, it will be the coming Friday.” Residents of Damascus said police officers were seen heading from a headquarters on the outskirts in Zabadani toward the capital, where military security officers had reportedly turned out in greater numbers. The security presence was more pronounced in Homs, residents said, as scores of military vehicles loaded with soldiers and equipment were seen on the highway from Damascus. Police officers in plain clothes had gathered at the New Clock Square, where thousands of protesters had tried to stage an Egyptian-style sit-in on Monday night. Cellphones were hard to reach, and some land lines had been cut. In Homs, an organizer, Abu Kamel al-Dimashki, said the city was “like a ghost town and we are still mourning our martyrs, so everything is closed.” He said, “Things are a little scary.” In a sign of the anxiety, some protesters were already predicting violence. “We know if we’re asking for freedom, we will lose people,” said Salem Abu al-Saud, a protester who fled Homs this week but has remained in contact with people there. “At least in Homs, people are more determined than ever to participate, without fear.” The government has maintained that the uprising is led by militant Islamists, and organizers acknowledge that organized religious forces like the banned Muslim Brotherhood have forcefully taken part. The government has also accused foreign countries of supporting the protests. And, indeed, some of the largest have occurred in cities near Syria’s borders: Dara’a, a poor town in southwestern Syria near Jordan , and Homs, the country’s third largest city and an industrial center near conservative northern Lebanon . But so far, the government has sought to hew to a policy of crackdown and compromise. On Thursday, Mr. Assad signed decrees that repealed harsh emergency rule, in place since 1963, abolished draconian security courts and granted citizens the right to protest peacefully, though they still need government permission to gather. The orders had already been handed down to his government on Tuesday, making his endorsement a formality; its timing seemed aimed in part at blunting Friday’s protests. He also appointed a new governor in Homs. Two weeks ago, the previous governor, Mohammed Iyad Ghazzal, was dismissed. He had been in power since 2004 and was widely despised. “Homs wasn’t happy with the old governor, but a new one isn’t the urgent issue,” said a government employee who gave his name as Khalid. “We want to change the mentality of how the country is run, not change a governor or his administration.” Sporadic protests erupted again Thursday, though their numbers were not as large as in past demonstrations, and they seemed confined to Kurdish areas. Organizers said about 300 people protested at a university in Hasakah, a city near the Turkish and Iraqi borders, and a larger demonstration occurred in Ayn al-Arab, east of Aleppo. Between 5,000 and 8,000 people marched there, though Mr. Tarif said it seemed more spontaneous than organized. He said the Kurdish leadership in the region had yet to endorse bigger turnouts, debating whether they could instead extract more concessions from a government that has already granted citizenship to as many as 300,000 stateless Kurds. The debate is a microcosm of a larger one taking place in Syria, where many fear the prospect of chaos or score-settling in the event of the government’s collapse. Many activists said the reforms so far were too little and too late; in the words of Haitham Maleh, an oft-imprisoned activist and former judge, “the mentality of the regime has to change.” But some worry about the combustibility of a society that is shadowed by sectarian resentments fostered by the government. And many identify that government almost entirely with the Alawite minority, a heterodox Muslim sect that accounts for 10 percent of Syria’s population. “Let’s be realistic, let’s not destroy the country,” said Camille Otrakji, a Damascus-born political blogger in Montreal . “Why do you think there aren’t millions in the street demonstrating against Bashar? It’s not because they’re afraid of the security forces. It’s because they’re afraid of what would replace Assad.”",

    "source": "Financial Crisis Dims Hopes for Giant Cross-Border Banks in Europe <eos> FRANKFURT — Only a few years ago, the future of European banking was said to belong to European champions, big border-straddling banks that would compete with the American giants. Instead, European integration has been replaced by Balkanization. Because of the financial crisis, banks are retrenching and refocusing on their home markets, all but abandoning ambitions of banking on a Continental scale — or bigger. Strings-attached government rescue plans and basic business logic are driving the change. So instead of strategies for global conquest, Martin Blessing, the chief executive of Commerzbank, is concentrating on ways to keep credit flowing to the small and medium-size businesses that form the backbone of the German economy. “We will see a domestic refocusing of banking but not because everyone is turning nationalist or because one or the other governments take stakes,” he said during a recent interview at his office in the bank’s stunning Norman Foster-designed office tower here. “Banks are going to look at where their franchise is strongest.” These new realities could end up hurting Eastern Europe most. After communism, privatization led to an extended gold rush for Western bankers. Now those investors are having to decide whether to continue lending at home — in France or Austria — or in Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary. In the global financial crisis, with the health of many banks dependent on the good will of their home governments, the choice is not hard. The thinking at the heart of cross-border expansion in Europe was always straightforward: Europe needed banks that could achieve economies of scale and have the global reach, global clients and global influence to compete with American titans. Operating on that basis, a handful of European banks moved to grow and consolidate. In 2004, Banco Santander of Spain bought Abbey National of Britain. A year later, Italy’s UniCredit swallowed the bank HVB Group of Germany. In early 2007, Royal Bank of Scotland led a consortium that snapped up ABN Amro of the Netherlands for 70 billion euros, or $92 billion at current exchange rates. That deal is already coming undone, with the implosion last year of Fortis, one of Royal Bank’s partners. More broadly, nationalist impulses are on the move across the Continent, with many politicians arguing — as some Democrats are in the United States — that if the government is going to bail out banks, then taxpayers should get some ownership and some say in how they operate. For example, Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, has said he wants to stay out of the operating side of the banks Britain has bailed out. But his government is under heavy pressure to help small businesses at home, and the documents that created the new British vehicle for investing in banks, United Kingdom Financial Investments, cite domestic lending as its priority. French and German governments have also injected cash into their banks, both with the goal of keeping money flowing to businesses inside their borders. Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, called the developments the Balkanization of European finance. “Whenever governments get into the share capital of banks, even in a small way, of course they think nationally,” Mr. Gros said. For instance, few banks expanded more rapidly in Germany over the last decade than Royal Bank of Scotland. The British financier muscled onto Continental turf with attractive financing packages for German manufacturers. Today, Royal Bank is majority-owned by the British government after losses in 2008 from £7 billion to £8 billion, or $9.2 billion to $10.5 billion. According to two senior German executives, Royal Bank is now playing tough with German clients, calling in loans as the bank retrenches in favor of its British business. The executives, who asked not to be identified, because they were not authorized to publicly discuss confidential negotiations, said Royal Bank had demanded that its clients on the Continent sell assets, despite the catastrophic state of financial markets, so the bank could recover its cash quickly, perhaps to lend in Britain. Most recently, Royal Bank was a major creditor of Adolf Merckle, the German billionaire who killed himself when it became clear the banks — with Royal Bank in the lead, the executives said — would insist on the sale of his prized possession, the generic drug maker Ratiopharm. Christine Kortyka, a Royal Bank spokeswoman in Germany, denied the bank was retrenching. “We are an international bank with international clients and we will continue to serve them where they need us,” she said. Mr. Blessing, who took over at Commerzbank just in time to sell a 25 percent stake to the German government to stabilize its finances and complete a major acquisition, does not dispute that governments are angling for national advantage. Commerzbank styles itself the bank of Germany’s Mittelstand, as this country’s small and midsize companies are known. Mr. Blessing says he is comfortable with focusing on serving the Mittelstand, because that has always been the bank’s core mission. . As part of the deal for a cash infusion, the German government received the right to veto major decisions by the bank. That means it can ward off any acquisition from abroad — or any effort at a European expansion.",

    "source": "Montana Judicial Race Joins Big-Money Fray <eos> HELENA, Mont. — In a coffee shop on Last Chance Gulch, a woman approached Mike Wheat to say she was planning to knock on doors for him. “It’s getting pretty brutal out there,” she said. Mr. Wheat, a State Supreme Court justice running in the most expensive judicial race on record in Montana, nodded. In a parade of menacing television ads paid for by conservative groups, he has been attacked for “a history of supporting extreme partisan measures” (voting to raise fees on hunting licenses), and for allowing convicted criminals to use legal “loopholes” to go free. On the other side, unions and trial lawyers have accused his opponent, Lawrence VanDyke, of being “in the pocket” of out-of-state “special interests.” When Justice Wheat, 66, decided to run for another eight-year term on the court, he said, “I never really anticipated that I would end up with a race like this. I never thought it would turn into this gigantic money battle.” But judicial races have been evolving into another political battleground for big money. A last-minute surge of spending brought the total spent on television commercials to $12.1 million in 10 states, according to two groups that track judicial campaign spending. This election cycle, the spending race has been fueled by the Republican State Leadership Committee , which pledged to spend $5 million on a “judicial fairness initiative,” and contributed $400,000 in North Carolina last week. In the one election that has already taken place, in August, conservative efforts were unsuccessful. Despite spending more than $500,000 to unseat three justices, Tennessee voters retained them. Image Lawrence VanDyke, center, and his wife, Cheryl, on Saturday at the University of Montana in Missoula. Credit Lauren Grabelle for The New York Times In Montana, independent conservative groups have spent about $640,000 — $469,000 by a political action committee financed by the Republican State Leadership Committee and $170,000 by Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by the brothers David H. and Charles G. Koch, according to figures provided by the Brennan Center for Justice in New York and Americans for Prosperity . In response, a political action committee financed largely by Montana trial lawyers and unions has spent $475,000. The money dwarfs what the candidates have raised under Montana’s strict individual contribution limit of $320: $132,000 for Mr. VanDyke and $143,000 for Justice Wheat, according to the most recent campaign filings. “It’s becoming one more log on the fire of the growth in big-money pressure politics,” said Bert Brandenburg, the executive director of Justice at Stake , which advocates judicial election reform. “What’s different is, of course, we want judges to be different. We pay legislators to make a promise and keep a promise; we pay judges to decide a case one at a time and ignore outside pressure. If money affects a legislator’s vote, it stinks. If money affects a judge’s decision, you’ve just violated the Constitution.” Justice Wheat, a trial lawyer, grew up in Montana, served in the Marine Corps in Vietnam and began practicing law in 1978. He was elected to the State Legislature as a Democrat and ran unsuccessfully for attorney general before being appointed to the Supreme Court, the state’s highest court, in 2010 by a Democratic governor. The next election he was subjected, as all appointed justices are, to a retention vote, and won. He has participated in hundreds of cases , voting to require a wealthy landowner to allow access to a public waterways and to allow same-sex couples to receive benefits, and dissenting from the court when it allowed new gas wells to be drilled — because, he said, the required environmental impact studies had not been conducted. In criminal cases, he has sided with both the accused and the prosecution. He is friendly to plaintiffs and trial lawyers, voting to allow a bat manufacturer to be held liable for the death of a teenager hit in the head by a baseball, and dissenting in a case in which the court denied a $1.2 million fee arrangement for lawyers. Nonetheless, he has been endorsed by former justices and Republican officeholders, who say they resent out-of-state interference and what they view as an injection of partisanship. “To take a little sliver of my record and bend it to a political message that they’re trying to get across, it’s wrong, it’s disingenuous and it’s misleading to the voters,” Justice Wheat said. His challenger, Mr. VanDyke, 41, grew up in Montana and worked for his father’s construction company, earning an engineering degree before winning a scholarship to Harvard Law School. As an editor on the Law Review, he defended a book that argued that it was constitutional to teach intelligent design in public school. After graduating, he worked in Washington and Dallas for Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the large corporate law firm that has given rise to prominent conservatives like Kenneth Starr. He came back to Montana when Tim Fox, a Republican, was elected attorney general in 2012 and appointed Mr. VanDyke to the post of solicitor general. There, Mr. VanDyke placed a special emphasis on writing amicus briefs supporting gun rights and anti-abortion laws. In one brief he wrote with Mr. Fox, they argued that Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision preserving a woman’s right to an abortion, should be reconsidered in the light of “recent, compelling evidence of fetal pain.” But he quit in May after conflicts with colleagues. Asked about critics who say he has tried to hide the extent of his conservatism from voters, he said, “I am running on the platform that I am going to follow the law regardless of my personal preferences.” Image Mike Wheat, left, with Llevando Fisher on Friday in Lame Deer. Credit Kristina Barker for The New York Times Corporate interests, who say they are trying to preserve jobs and create growth, and trial lawyers, who say they represent the voiceless against the wealthy and powerful, have long gone head to head in judicial elections. As in any arms race, both sides say they are just trying to defend against the other. “Right-of-center interests have been long outspent by left-of-center interests on judicial races,” said Matt Walter, the executive director of the Republican State Leadership Committee. “So we feel like we’ve provided some measure of balance for voters to make an educated choice.” Alicia Bannon, a lawyer at the Brennan Center, said there have been some races where business groups have been vastly outspent. But “nationally,” she continued, “conservatives have been the bigger spenders.” According to her analysis: “Among the top 10 spenders on Supreme Court races from 2000 to 2009, 69 percent of spending came from business interests and conservative groups. In 2009 to 2010, the figure was 70 percent. In 2011-12, things were more evenly divided: Among the top 10 spenders in 2011-12, 52 percent of spending came from business interests and conservative groups.” Mr. VanDyke said courts in Montana had long been controlled by trial lawyers who funded election campaigns in a “pay-to-play” scheme, pointing to a 2004 race in which the Montana Trial Lawyers Association contributed $326,000 to retain a justice, James C. Nelson. “There is no way that I could have a chance against the trial lawyer money machine without independent expenditures coming in and helping me,” Mr. VanDyke said. Al Smith, the executive director of the trial lawyers group, said lawyers were trying to ensure that candidates were credible and had experience with Montana law. In 2004, he said, the challenger was inexperienced and the group anticipated a large amount of spending from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that never materialized. “In 2006, 2008, ’10, ’12, we didn’t spend anything — nothing, zero,” he said. “The idea that we’ve been spending all this money for decades is absolutely false.”",

    "source": "Airbus Unveils Jet and Broadens Rivalry With Boeing <eos> TOULOUSE, France — The A350 XWB, the first all-new commercial jet from Airbus in more than six years, took wing into partly cloudy skies here on Friday. There was a lot more riding on it than the multinational crew of two test pilots and four engineers. The new aircraft carries the burden of dispelling Airbus’s reputation for cross-cultural and industrial dysfunction, which caused costly delays in the introduction of the company’s previous plane, the A380 superjumbo. And in the wake of last year’s failed merger of the plane maker’s parent, European Aeronautic Defense and Space, and the British military contractor BAE Systems, Airbus is betting its future more heavily on the success of commercial jets like the A350. It is no coincidence that Airbus showed off the A350 — a twin-engine wide-body jet meant to compete with Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and 777 — as the global aviation industry assembled for the biennial Paris Air Show, scheduled to open Monday at Le Bourget Airport north of the French capital. As always at the show, which is the world’s largest aerospace bazaar, any announcements by other industry players will be undercard matches compared with the main event of Airbus vs. Boeing. While both aircraft makers are going into the show with order books for commercial airliners fat enough to keep their assembly lines humming for much of the next decade, military budgets are shrinking in the United States and Europe, the two biggest spenders on military planes. Few, if any, major announcements for military orders are expected at the show, and belt-tightening at the Pentagon means that the turnout of American military contractors will be among the lowest in recent memory. Northrop Grumman, for example, will be absent, and the delegations from Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Boeing’s defense and security division, among others, will be much smaller than in years past. And this year’s show may be relatively subdued in terms of new commercial jet order announcements as well, given the uncertain near-term outlook for airline profits and economic growth, particularly in emerging markets. But on Friday the spotlight was on Toulouse-Blagnac Airport, about a 90-minute flight south of Paris, where, precisely at 10 a.m., the A350 lifted effortlessly from the sun-dappled runway. The purr of the plane’s two Rolls-Royce engines was momentarily drowned out by the cheers and whistles of a throng of Airbus employees, well-wishers and members of the news media who had gathered — camera phones at the ready — to capture the moment. Image Fabrice Brégier, chief executive of Airbus, with the test flight’s crew. The A350 is the company’s first new jetliner in more than six years. Credit Bob Edme/Associated Press The distinctive curled tips of the carbon-fiber wings glinted briefly before the jet slipped into the clouds. Judith Lindner, a 36-year-old quality control technician from an Airbus factory in Stade, Germany, whooped as the jet sailed past, jabbing her thumb in the air. “What a tremendous thrill — fantastic,” Ms. Lindner said, adding that she had helped inspect the vertical stabilizer on the plane’s tail. “I feel such a mix of pride and relief.” Analysts said the value of a well-timed and well-executed A350 debut could not be overestimated. Some said they still expected Airbus to try to maintain the public relations momentum by staging an A350 flyby sometime during the weeklong show in Paris. It would be hard for Airbus to find a bigger stage. Show organizers said they expected the chalets and exhibition halls of the air show to be filled with more than 2,200 companies from more than 40 countries. As many as 350,000 visitors from the aerospace industry, as well as the public, are expected over the course of the week. Even Boeing executives acknowledged that the timing of the A350 flight was likely to steal much of the American company’s thunder at the event. “I know they work hard to keep the home fans entertained,” Randy Tinseth, Boeing’s head of marketing, said at a briefing on Tuesday in Paris. Not so long ago, Airbus’s prospects did not look nearly as bright. It was struggling to roll out its last big-bet plane: the twin-deck A380. Miscommunication in the design, manufacturing and installation of electrical cables resulted in a series of missteps in the mid-2000s that delayed the A380’s first delivery by three years. The debacle prompted a management reshuffle in 2006 and more than $6 billion in losses. Airbus executives say they are determined not to repeat the experience. For the new A350, the company has changed its internal design systems and decision-making, even involving major suppliers in the process from the start. While in the past Airbus engineers in France and Germany operated independently, in some cases using incompatible tools and software, they now collaborate on shared digital blueprints. So far, analysts said, Airbus has managed to keep the A350’s development hiccups to a relative minimum. Friday’s flight took place about a year later than the company had envisioned when it began marketing the plane in 2007 — not all that significant a delay in aerospace terms. Image Airbus showed off its A350, a jet intended to compete with Boeing’s Dreamliner, just days before the opening of the Paris Air Show. Credit Eric Cabanis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Airbus, of course, is not the only jet maker that has had trouble with new products. Boeing rolled out its 787 Dreamliner three years late, and early this year was forced to ground the plane for three months after its lightweight but volatile lithium-ion batteries proved prone to overheating. “This is quickly coming down to a battle of credibility” between Airbus and Boeing, said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. “Signaling that you are a reliable provider sends a great message.” That is especially crucial because orders for commercial jets have slowed after several years of record purchases. This month, the International Air Transport Association, a trade group based in Geneva and Montreal, predicted that its 240 member airlines would report a combined profit of $12.7 billion in 2013, up from $7.6 billion last year. But those expected gains are largely the result of falling fuel prices and efforts to pack more customers onto fewer planes, rather than a jump in travel demand. While new jet sales may be slowing, there is still a big backlog of plane orders. Both Boeing and Airbus, as well as smaller jet makers like Bombardier of Canada and Embraer of Brazil, have been steadily increasing output. That has increased short-term demand for components, posing a quandary for parts suppliers. Many are reluctant to invest too heavily in new production capacity for fear that they will later be saddled with redundant plants and equipment — and debt. “I hear concerns everywhere in commercial markets about the reliability and resilience of the supply chain when they are increasing production everywhere,” said Damien Lasou, a managing director and aerospace analyst at Accenture in Paris. “It is a big distraction to management, particularly in terms of capital investment.” In recent years, the battle for commercial jet sales has focused on shorter-range, single-aisle models like the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737, particularly after the two companies introduced new versions of those planes with more fuel-efficient engines. But airlines have also begun to show renewed interest in the latest wide-body jets, which can offer significantly greater range and more seats than previous models — promising bigger profit margins on long-distance routes. Several flag carriers, including Ethiopian Airlines, Japan Airlines, Lufthansa of Germany and Malaysia Airlines, say they are considering multibillion-dollar orders for the larger jets, including the A350 and the 787. Despite the battery hazards that were revealed on the 787 this year, airlines remain keenly interested in the plane, which is built extensively from lightweight composite materials. “The shelf life of new jetliner controversy is slightly less than fresh oysters,” Mr. Aboulafia of Teal Group said of the Boeing 787’s troubles. “It goes away incredibly fast.”",

    "source": "New York City Police Study Use of Force; May Issue More Tasers <eos> Days after the death of a man who was subdued by police officers on Staten Island, the Police Department is undertaking a sweeping review of its training and tactics, Commissioner William J. Bratton said on Tuesday. A senior police official said one change under discussion was the expanded use of Taser stun guns , which are available to a small number of New York officers but have been controversial here and elsewhere because of the risk they can pose to people with heart problems and other medical issues. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said stun guns could be a way to provide officers with more options for subduing people who were resisting arrest and avoiding the close contact that can lead to serious, even fatal, injuries to officers and suspects. Speaking to reporters at Police Headquarters, Mr. Bratton said the goal of the review was “to develop state-of-the-art use-of-force policies.” The remarks came as he addressed investigations into the death of the man on Staten Island, Eric Garner, 43. Mr. Garner died on Thursday after officers who had been trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes forced him to the ground. In a widely viewed video of the encounter, one of the officers appeared to use a chokehold — banned by the Police Department — to subdue Mr. Garner, who was heard repeatedly saying, “I can’t breathe.” Other video taken later appears to show Mr. Garner unconscious and unresponsive to police officers and emergency medical workers. The medical examiner’s office is conducting an autopsy to determine what caused the death of Mr. Garner, who weighed 350 pounds and had health problems including asthma. Pathologists will seek to determine whether the chokehold contributed to his death. The Staten Island district attorney’s office is investigating Mr. Garner’s death, and the Police Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau is examining the conduct of the officers. The officer who appeared to use a chokehold has been stripped of his badge and gun, and an officer who helped hold down Mr. Garner has been placed on desk duty. Image William J. Bratton Credit Michael Appleton for The New York Times At the news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Bratton said he had met with F.B.I. officials in New York “to discuss their monitoring of this matter.” Mr. Bratton added that he expected the episode would ultimately be reviewed by federal prosecutors. Mr. Bratton said that next week he would visit the Police Academy to see the presentations that officers receive on how to “take people down” and “take them into custody.” During his remarks, Mr. Bratton did not mention Tasers, and it was not clear whether internal discussions about expanding the use of Tasers predated the episode on Staten Island or were in response to it. “There have been conversations, but nothing definitive,” said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal policy debates. The Police Department has been warier of Tasers than have many departments elsewhere. Stun guns have a scandal-tainted history in New York. In the 1980s, an early-model stun gun was used to force drug suspects to confess. Emergency Service Unit officers, who are highly trained and handle many of the department’s emergency calls regarding emotionally disturbed people, began carrying Tasers shortly after the 1984 death of Eleanor Bumpurs, a disturbed woman who was shot to death by the police after she threatened officers with a knife. As the use of stun guns grew around the country, the Police Department modestly expanded their use. In 2008, the department instructed some sergeants to wear Tasers on their gun belts instead of storing them in the trunks of police cruisers, as had been the practice. The move stemmed in part from a study the department commissioned in 2007 after an unarmed Queens man, Sean Bell, was shot dead by officers. Among the recommendations in the study, conducted by the RAND Corporation, was that the Police Department consider making Tasers more widely available to officers. But months after the police began to expand the use of Tasers, an emotionally disturbed man in Brooklyn fell to his death after the police shot him with a Taser. In that September 2008 episode, the man, Iman Morales, had engaged in a 30-minute standoff with the police, waving a fluorescent light bulb from a building ledge. A lieutenant on the scene ordered another officer with the Emergency Service Unit to fire a Taser at Mr. Morales, who fell headfirst to the sidewalk. Within days, the lieutenant, Michael W. Pigott, killed himself .",

    "source": "Chinese, Spending Freely, Become Ever-Larger Tourism Force in New York <eos> New York City’s tourism officials have solved the riddle of how to attract the Chinese. The challenge now may lie in impressing them once they arrive. Chinese tourists, who have been flocking to New York in rising numbers for a decade, accounted for nearly one million of the record 60.3 million visitors to the city in 2016, city officials said. But some, like Li Chen, a retired bureaucrat from Beijing, are far from awed by the scale of America’s biggest city. Mr. Chen said he and the five friends he was sightseeing with on Friday expected New York to have taller buildings and wider streets. They were also disappointed that they could not get a look inside the New York Stock Exchange. “We don’t want to just see the door,” Mr. Chen said through an interpreter while sipping hot tea on a cruise of New York Harbor operated by Hornblower New York . “Closing the door is like closing the door to prosperity.” Hornblower bills the tour as international, but the narration piped through the speakers is only in English and Mandarin. Visitors from China are easily the largest group of foreign tourists on Hornblower’s tours, said Zichao Xie, the company’s international sightseeing manager. Ms. Xie said the company carried about 300,000 Chinese passengers this year, accounting for about one-quarter of its revenue. The Chinese surpassed Brazilians and Canadians in the ranks of tourists to the city this year and will overtake the British by 2022, said Fred Dixon, the chief executive of NYC & Company , the city’s tourism marketer. He said the city had more than 950,000 visitors from China this year, a sevenfold increase since 2007. Back then, more than 15 countries, including Switzerland and Israel, sent more tourists to New York than China did, according to NYC & Company’s statistics. In 2016, only visitors from Britain outnumbered the Chinese — and their total of about 1.2 million has not grown since 2007. The Chinese still travel mostly in groups, moving around on chartered buses and often staying in hotels outside the city , Ms. Xie said. But Mr. Dixon said his organization had begun to focus on attracting more Chinese tourists traveling on their own or in small groups like Mr. Chen’s. Those men flew from Shanghai with a larger group but broke off from it and were staying in a hotel in Lower Manhattan. They planned to go uptown to shop on Fifth Avenue, then head on Saturday to the Woodbury Common outlet mall , one of the most popular excursions for Chinese tourists, about 50 miles north of the city. Image Tourists on a cruise of New York Harbor on Friday. Their numbers in the city surpassed those of Brazilians and Canadians this year. Credit Christian Hansen for The New York Times “That individual travel market is the biggest opportunity,” Mr. Dixon said. “That’s the future of the Chinese market.” Emily Rafferty, chairwoman of NYC & Company, said she had recently attended a conference in Shenzhen, China, and met a group of local university students. “They were all wanting to come over to America,” Ms. Rafferty said. “The number of people under the age of 35 there is huge.” At the Museum of Chinese in America , on Centre Street in Manhattan, the boom in Chinese tourism has not really paid off yet. The president of the museum, Nancy Yao Maasbach, said the tourists tended to stick to the best-known destinations. “Our strategy has actually been that the more popular we become in the U.S., the more popular we will become to Chinese tourists,” Ms. Maasbach said. Mr. Dixon said the Chinese were still spending freely, while visitors from Europe were cutting back as the dollar strengthened and reduced the buying power of the euro and other currencies. He said NYC & Company had begun emphasizing value and bargains in some of its advertising to the British and other Europeans, including a campaign this winter called “ See It for Yourself ,” in partnership with British Airways. Those audiences might be easier to impress, judging by the reactions of Tony Neville and James Hopkinson, two first-time visitors from Yorkshire, England, who fit in some sightseeing on Friday after completing a work project. Mr. Neville, 36, said New York was bigger than he had imagined. “This just blows London out of the water, to me,” he said. Mr. Hopkinson said they had been surprised by how friendly, well mannered and courteous the local people they encountered had been. They even liked the American beers they had found, he said, sipping from a can of Brooklyn Lager. Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor responsible for economic development, said Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration wanted to diversify the city’s tourist base so that it could weather economic downturns in Europe. Toward that end, the city increased its contribution to NYC & Company’s budget this year by $3.5 million, to about $21 million, she said. Promoting tourism is an investment aimed at attracting visitors to spend money and at creating jobs, especially for less-skilled workers, Ms. Glen said. She said she tried to help out last week when she was on a plane full of Chileans flying to New York from South America. Ms. Glen said that the Chileans had been excited to visit the new Whitney Museum of American Art and to walk on the High Line in Manhattan, but that she had tried to persuade them to try the Brooklyn Museum, too. “They used to go to Miami all the time,” she said of Chileans. “But Miami is so over.”",

    "source": "Fox Sees Chemistry in New Baseball Booth <eos> A game with three announcers in a booth can be overly wordy. It can be filled with smart opinions from two analysts who come from sharply divergent backgrounds. Or it can sound out of balance if one analyst dominates the airspace. Fox Sports will learn this season which description fits its new lead baseball announcing team of Joe Buck, Harold Reynolds and Tom Verducci. Reynolds and Verducci are replacing Tim McCarver, who spent 18 seasons working with Buck and left after the 2013 season. “We didn’t take this decision lightly,” John Entz, the executive producer of Fox Sports, said Monday in a conference call with reporters. “When you have someone taking the mantle from Tim McCarver, we felt an extreme level of pressure.” Entz said he felt strongly enough about Reynolds and Verducci’s potential that he brought them to St. Louis last summer to rehearse a game with Buck, off the air, at Busch Stadium. “Within five minutes, I knew this would be the combination, if my opinion had anything to do with it,” Buck said. Verducci said, “I came away in the first minute and thought it was fun.” He also sensed a rhythm in which he, Reynolds and Buck gave one another room to speak, rather than stepping on one another’s words. The three subsequently got together once more to rehearse with a taped game on a television monitor. Reynolds and Verducci have worked together at the MLB Network for a few years and generated a personal chemistry that Entz said he believed would transfer to games. Verducci is a less traditional choice for a game analyst than Reynolds, a former second baseman for the Seattle Mariners. Verducci never played for a Major League Baseball team but has written about the sport for more than 30 years, most recently as a senior staff writer for Sports Illustrated. And he has called some games in recent years for MLB Network and Fox. The Buck-Reynolds-Verducci team will not be together every week of the season, which is the first under a new contract for Fox in which fewer games will be carried on the Fox broadcast network and many will be carried, for the first time, on Fox Sports 1. At the least, the new team will call eight prime-time games on the Fox broadcast network between May 24 and July 12, along with the All-Star Game and the postseason. Buck seemed to toll a small warning bell on the reception his new partners might receive, based on criticism that he and McCarver endured. “I don’t think there is any more criticized or picked-apart role in major television sports than doing a World Series on network television,” he said.",

    "source": "6 Major Powers Move Closer to Considering More Iran Sanctions <eos> UNITED NATIONS — Six major powers agreed Saturday that the Iranian response to proposals to altering its nuclear development program had been inadequate and that it warranted consideration of further measures by the United Nations Security Council . China , however, which sent a low-level diplomat to the meeting, maintained its position that it opposed new sanctions now. The five permanent members of the Security Council — the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France — along with Germany have been pursuing a “dual track” policy under which they would seek a negotiated settlement, but if that effort stalled, further sanctions would be imposed. “We talked mostly about the second track, but it doesn’t mean we should abandon the first one,” said Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s representative. “It is inconclusive in the sense that we didn’t make any decisions right away.” Western officials tried to cast a positive light on the meeting by suggesting that all six were at least moving in the same direction, even if it was unclear that China remained committed to the idea of a second track. “The credible threat of further pressure does create some leverage over the Iranian system,” said one Western diplomat engaged in the talks. The senior diplomats agreed to consult again by telephone before the end of the month on the next step. Most countries were represented on the level of senior diplomats, the “political directors” of their foreign ministries, but China virtually snubbed the gathering by dispatching a counselor from its United Nations mission. He Yafei, the former vice minister of foreign affairs, has now been appointed the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva and it is unclear who will eventually replace him in the talks. The meeting Saturday was held in the New York offices of the European Union, whose representative said that there was at least “consensus” among the six nations to focus on the next step. “We will continue to seek a negotiated solution, but consideration of appropriate further measures has also begun,” said Robert Cooper, a senior European Union official. Both China and Russia voted in the Security Council for three previous rounds of sanctions, but only China has been outspoken in its recent opposition. Russia was upset that its offer to further enrich Iranian uranium at its facilities was rebuffed and that the Iranians did not seem serious about entering negotiations. The Obama administration has also been dismayed that Iran has been dismissive of a yearlong effort to engage it. Iran maintains that its desire to enrich uranium is only for peaceful civilian purposes, but Western powers accuse it of using that as a smokescreen to develop nuclear weapons . There is a sense of urgency about the matter, as there are concerns that Iran will develop the capacity to enrich uranium at the levels required for weapons, while negotiations drag on. In addition, the international Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is due for a review conference in May, and the Western powers want any new sanctions against Iran to be in place so as not to complicate any talks over the future of the treaty.",

    "source": "Blagojevich to End Boycott of His Own Trial <eos> SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — After boycotting his impeachment trial for three days, Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich announced Wednesday that he wanted to address the State Senate on Thursday before legislators begin deliberations on whether to remove him from office. “He wants to make a closing argument,” said Lucio Guerrero, the governor’s spokesman. Mr. Guerrero said he was uncertain when or precisely why Mr. Blagojevich had chosen now to attend the trial, which he has repeatedly denounced as unfair and fixed. The governor will not give sworn testimony or be subject to cross-examination by prosecutors or legislators. Rather, he will address the Senate only to respond to the prosecution’s closing argument. Mr. Blagojevich’s announcement, which came about an hour before the prosecution rested its case, brought negative reactions from lawmakers. Many had previously lamented the governor’s absence from the proceedings and had repeatedly requested he testify. “It’s somewhat cowardly that he won’t take questions,” said Senator Dan Cronin, a Republican. “If he had something to say, he should have come down here like a man and faced the music.” Since he will not be giving testimony, senators said his appearance would not be included as evidence in their deliberations. “All the testimony was heard, so the things that we will consider, all that has taken place,” said Senator James F. Clayborne Jr., a Democrat. “I’m waiting to hear the closing argument tomorrow.” During a publicity tour this week, Mr. Blagojevich, a Democrat who was arrested Dec. 9 on federal corruption charges, repeatedly professed his innocence, complaining bitterly that many of the damning statements attributed to him had been taken out of context and saying the impeachment trial was unfair. Senators here have denounced the publicity campaign. Earlier in the day, the Senate president, John Cullerton, a Democrat, challenged Mr. Blagojevich to appear. “If he wants to come down here, instead of hiding out in New York and having Larry King asking questions instead of the senators — I think he’s making a mistake.” Still, Mr. Blagojevich’s charges seemed to rattle some senators, who worried the trial might appear politically motivated after the prosecution announced that it wanted to avoid redundant testimony and would call only 6 of its 13 scheduled witnesses. “If you eliminate half the witnesses and you speed up the process, does that send the wrong signal?” asked Senator Dave Syverson, a Republican. “Everything is being done very much above board, in fact, we’re going overboard to make sure everything is done fair. It’s just the perception.” Other senators said that even if the additional testimony was redundant, they would rather hear it out of an abundance of caution. “I don’t know who has a cruise or vacation to go to, but we ought to take our time,” Senator Kirk Dillard, a Republican, told a crush of reporters in an early morning break from the trial. “I’ll sit here on Super Bowl Sunday if I have to.” Amid the tumult of the proceedings on Wednesday, prosecutors painstakingly presented their final witness, William Holland, the state’s auditor general. He testified that starting in 2004 the Blagojevich administration endeavored to buy roughly 773,000 doses of a European flu vaccine that the Food and Drug Administration had prohibited. “The drugs were never going to come in to the U.S. because they’d been prohibited by the F.D.A.,” Mr. Holland said under questioning. “The vaccines were shipped to Pakistan, where the last we heard they were destroyed.” With the prosecution at rest, senators have only to hear closing arguments before casting votes on two issues. The first will be whether to remove the governor from office. The second will be to determine whether Mr. Blagojevich should be barred from holding office in the future. While many senators said they were still waiting to hear the closing arguments before making their final decision, it seemed unlikely that Mr. Blagojevich, who is scheduled to speak for 90 minutes after arriving here on Thursday morning by plane, would be able to sway many to his side. “This is typical of his style, the grand slam, the P.R. flourish,” said Senator Christine Radogno, the Republican minority leader. “It’s too bad he wasn’t here earlier in the week, I wish he had been.” She added, “I hope he has a ride home.”",

    "source": "A Small Empire Built on Cuddly and Fuzzy Branches Out From the Web <eos> CALENDARS and coffee table books filled with pictures of cute, cuddly kitties and sad-eyed puppies have been around for decades. So what explains the success of Cute Overload, a new page-a-day desk calendar that recently shot to the top of its category on Amazon.com and, more remarkably, to the upper ranks of the site’s overall best-sellers list? Stranger still, the birth of Cute Overload was almost purely accidental. Meg Frost, a 36-year-old design manager at Apple, started cuteoverload.com three years ago to test Web software. Within months, it became an online institution, drawing about 88,000 unique visitors a day — about the same as the political gossip blog Wonkette. BoingBoing linked to Cute Overload, saying that viewing the site “is like taking a happy pill.” And in that warm feeling lies the reason for its popularity. Given all the nastiness on the Internet — blog trolls, flame wars, vicious gossip, pornography, snark and spam — what better antidote is there than looking at pictures of tiny ducklings waddling in a line or kittens splayed on their backs, paw pads in the air? The most famous cute-animal Web sites are presented with a touch of self-mockery. The site I Can Has Cheezburger? ( icanhascheezburger.com ) features cat pictures with ungrammatical captions, Stuff on My Cat ( stuffonmycat.com ) displays photos of objects stacked on sleeping cats, and Kittenwars.com pits pairs of cat photos in a cuteness showdown. Like those sites, Cute Overload is “cute, but not cutesy,” says Ms. Frost. “There’s definitely an edge.” Ms. Frost has not given up her day job at Apple. “I actually love doing both, though it’s pretty crazy,” she said. Viewers send her about 100 submissions a day, and in doing so, grant her full republishing rights, she said. Ms. Frost is free to reuse the photos as she pleases. The calendar’s success may be just the beginning. She hints at other projects, possibly including a video channel. She is astounded at the calendar’s success. That it did so well on Amazon last week — and sold out in a day — “is totally ridiculous,” she said. Ms. Frost will not talk about how much money she has made from the site, although it is enough money that she recently hired two part-time assistants. Nor will she say how many calendars have been sold. But the calendar’s top ranking in its category — accessories — and its reaching as high as No. 21 last week on the overall category — books — are indications of its success. The site’s ads are placed by Blogads, which handles advertising for about 1,500 blogs, including the gossip site PerezHilton.com and the political site Daily Kos. On Blogads.com , advertisers can view traffic numbers for each site and the cost of various types of ads. According to Blogads, a “premium” ad on Cute Overload costs about $2,000 a week, with an estimated 808,000 page views. Hartz Mountain currently has a premium spot for its UltraGuard line of flea and tick repellents, as does American Apparel for its Essential X 3 line of underwear three-packs. The site also offers “standard” ads for $500 a week. Those are taken up mostly by small companies serving what might be called the “cute market.” Sublime Stitching, for example, sells “cute embroidery patterns,” like “Forest Friends,” while Shanalogic offers clothing and accessories emblazoned with cute imagery. According to Blogads, there are nine “standard” ads currently running on Cute Overload. That’s good money for a niche site. By comparison, Daily Kos is running one “second slot” ad for $7,500 a week and three standard ads for $4,650 each, according to Blogads, which says the site offers nearly 8 million ad impressions a week, about 10 times as many as Cute Overload. (Daily Kos’s “premium” slot, offered at $15,000, was unsold as of Tuesday.) It is all about niches and demographics, said Henry Copeland, founder of Blogads. The audience is overwhelmingly female and between 18 and 34. “For these women,” he said, “recently graduated from college and sitting in grim corporate America, Cute puts them in touch with their nonwork selves. It’s escapism.”",

    "source": "Convicted Editor of Indonesian Playboy Surrenders <eos> DENPASAR, Indonesia — The editor of Indonesia ’s defunct version of Playboy magazine surrendered himself to authorities on Saturday to serve a two-year jail term for indecency. Erwin Arnada was taken into custody by dozens of police on arrival from Bali to Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta airport, the local news media reported, after nearly two months of avoiding summonses and hiding from Islamist vigilantes who had vowed to arrest him. A third and final summons for Mr. Arnada to hand himself in expired on Friday. “I’ve been treated like a criminal, put in a prison car,” Mr. Arnada said by BlackBerry message after being taken. “I don’t yet believe there’s democracy in Indonesia; at least my case makes me think that,” he said. “If there was democracy in Indonesia, then freedom of the press would be guaranteed and valued. The press and journalists shouldn’t be criminalized as I have.” Mr. Arnada edited the Indonesian edition of Playboy — which contained no nudity and was far less risqué than many other titles legally on sale in Indonesia — from its debut in 2006 until 2007, when it was closed after riots by Islamist groups, including the Islamic Defenders Front, or F.P.I., had forced the magazine to move to Bali. Political pressure from Islamists was also widely believed to be behind indecency charges brought against Mr. Arnada, which were successfully defeated in two lower courts. In 2009, in an unpublicized decision, the Supreme Court convicted Mr. Arnada, but neither he nor his conservative adversaries were aware of it until prosecutors received a copy of the verdict in August. The FPI said it would hunt Mr. Arnada to hand him in to serve his sentence. Mr. Arnada’s lawyers are seeking a case review in the Supreme Court. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono did not reply to a request from lawyers and Indonesia’s Press Council to intervene to stop Mr. Arnada’s detention while the review was pending. The apparently arbitrary nature of Mr. Arnada’s conviction has been widely seen as a victory for Islamic conservatives intent on imposing their vision on Indonesia, a Muslim-majority country long known for its religious tolerance. President Yudhoyono and authorities have come under criticism for repeatedly bowing to pressure from groups such as the FPI, which has been blamed for a string of violent protests and inciting attacks against religious minorities and secularists.",

    "source": "Philadelphia Shows Its Love for an Owner Who Loved His Flyers <eos> PHILADELPHIA — Ed Snider once kicked Donald J. Trump out of a suite during a playoff game. No, not because Snider, a noted Ayn Rand disciple, may have had differing political views from Trump. The offense — Trump would not stop talking. Snider never wanted an interruption when he watched his beloved Philadelphia Flyers, the team he founded and owned until his death last week. He was remembered Thursday for his love of the Flyers, the fans and family at a public tribute at the Wells Fargo Center. Bobby Clarke, the Hall of Famer center and perhaps the greatest Flyer, had one wish for when he died. “I really hope I get one more chance to play a game in the orange and black for Mr. Snider’s Philadelphia Flyers,” he said. Snider would cringe when he was called Mr. Snider. He told everybody he knew — employees, the news media, players — to simply call him Ed. They rarely complied. He had earned immense respect as perhaps the most influential executive in Philadelphia sports history. Stanley Cup championship banners from 1974 and 1975 flanked the stage, the Flyers kept center ice cold and the logo shone bright on the floor inside the darkened arena. “EMS” — the initials for Edward Malcolm Snider — was painted on a banner and enveloped by a wreath. Snider died April 11 after a two-year battle with bladder cancer. He was 83. “It really hurt and it’s going to hurt us for a long time,” Clarke said at the memorial, which was open to the public. The current and former Philadelphia sports executives Billy King, Dave Montgomery, Scott O’Neil and Peter Luukko were among the mourners. Snider’s children remembered him as a father who warned them not to feed stray cats at the old Spectrum: “They’re here to catch the rats.” Michael Milken, the junk bond king of the 1980s, credited Snider for his “commitment and willingness to explore new medical treatments.” Commissioner Gary Bettman said Snider was a friend and confidant who helped shape the N.H.L. Bettman made a final visit in January to Snider’s California home for lunch. Bettman said Snider was in considerable pain, but he felt worse that a gloomy day had left them unable to see the mountains and the gorgeous view. Snider told Bettman that he loved him. “I love him, too,” Bettman said. “We all do. His impact on all of us is permanent. The fire in his eyes is now an eternal flame.” Bettman noted that Snider had many homes, “but Wells Fargo Center is the center of where Ed Snider lived.” Snider developed the arena, which opened as the new home of the Flyers and the 76ers in 1996. He was chairman of the 76ers, was once a part owner of the Eagles and had a hand in founding both Comcast’s local sports channel and the city’s largest sports-talk radio station. Snider, chairman of the Flyers’ parent company, Comcast-Spectacor, was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1988. He founded the Flyers in 1966, and in the 1970s, when they were known as the Broad Street Bullies, they became the first expansion team to win the Stanley Cup. But it was a 1972 postseason series defeat that would shape the Bullies, and Snider’s locker room pep talk still resonated with Clarke. “ ‘Boys, don’t worry about it,’ ” Clarke recalled him saying. “ ‘We’re going to be stronger because of it.’ Two years later, we won the Stanley Cup.” Snider always wanted to be remembered for more than hockey. He started the Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation in 2005. The foundation promotes life skills and hockey through after-school, recreational and other educational activities. Snider hockey programs are provided at no cost, and focus on underserved Philadelphia boys and girls who otherwise would not have the opportunity to play. Children wrote letters and drew pictures about Snider’s impact on them, and they were stationed around the arena’s concourse. “To me, Mr. Snider meant a new opportunity, a new opportunity to do something great,” one child wrote. “If I could say anything to him, it would be, thanks for letting me play a game I now love.” For all that Snider meant to the city, he was always full of gratitude for what Philadelphia and the Flyers gave to him. “The last full sentence he ever spoke to me, and this is what he said, not just for me or the family,” his son Jay Snider said, choking on his words. “He told me so I would tell you. And I quote, ‘I can’t thank the Flyers enough for everything they’ve given to me and my family. Thank you.’ ”",

    "source": "Egyptian Satirist Returns to TV With Careful Barbs <eos> CAIRO — As his popular television show returned to Egypt’s airwaves on Friday after a long hiatus, Bassem Youssef, an Egyptian satirist, took a swipe at the country’s new military leadership in perhaps the only manner such criticism remains possible: with great care. After playing a recently leaked video clip of Egypt’s defense minister, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, talking to colleagues about influencing the news media, Mr. Youssef responded with mock indignation. “Nobody can tell us what to say or not to say,” he said, as a disembodied arm appeared from beneath his desk, stole his script and replaced it with a new text. “We want freedom,” Mr. Youssef added, as the arm, a stand-in for Egypt’s powerful security agencies, slapped him in the face. It was Mr. Youssef’s first show since the military ousted President Mohamed Morsi in July, casting Egypt into a kind of fevered dream of violence and polarization. As the country’s Islamists were brutally swept from power by Egypt’s new leaders, television channels were also purged of dissent, cheering on the military-backed government and a mood of resurgent nationalism. That climate fed restless anticipation here for the return of Mr. Youssef’s show, called “The Program,” a weekly skewering of Egypt’s political class and the news media. Would he lampoon the new leadership as mercilessly as he had Mr. Morsi? While his fans hoped for the return of an independent voice to counter the conformity on the airwaves, the revived show was also a test of what the military-led government was prepared to allow. Mr. Youssef, a heart surgeon who modeled his program on Jon Stewart’s “Daily Show,” has attracted the ire of the authorities before. In March, prosecutors summoned him for questioning on charges that he had insulted Mr. Morsi. The administration denied that it was behind the questioning, but it was part of a pattern of similar charges leveled by Mr. Morsi’s sympathizers that chilled dissent against the Islamist government. Since Mr. Morsi’s ouster, the room for dissent has become far more restricted. The authorities have killed or imprisoned thousands of his Islamist supporters. Egyptian and foreign journalists have been harassed or arrested. In a deeply divided nation where it has become normal to be asked about one’s political loyalties, much of the stifling atmosphere seems self-imposed. As his program began Friday night, Mr. Youssef seemed more intent on advocating a third way in Egyptian politics, between loyalty to the military and loyalty to Islamist parties, than on provoking a confrontation with the new leaders. He did not speak in detail about the most incendiary news of the last few months — the mass killings of Morsi supporters by the authorities — but he said he stood against violence, whether by the state or against it. He explicitly poked fun at Egypt’s interim president, noting that many Egyptians seemed not even to know his name. (It’s Adly Mansour.) His jabs at General Sisi, widely seen as Egypt’s de facto leader, were more oblique. It seemed funnier, and perhaps safer, to make fun of the cult of personality the general had inspired. In a rapid-fire monologue, Mr. Youssef ran through the subjects that touch off Egypt’s daily arguments. It was an exhausting list that included the names of places where people had been killed and the justifications used to excuse such acts — a history of the latest tortured phase in Egypt’s transition since the fall of former President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. “Enough,” Mr. Youssef concluded. “Shh.” Despite his apparent attempts to calm the arguments, there was predictable outrage. On Twitter, Ahmed Sarhan, a former spokesman for Mr. Morsi’s rival in the presidential race, wrote, “The leader of the army shouldn’t be criticized or ridiculed as long as he’s wearing the uniform of the military.” On the opposite side, an Islamist supporter wrote that Mr. Youssef had provided “propaganda for the coup.” Dina Samak, a journalist, saw something hopeful even in the satirist’s cautious approach. “Bassem Youssef didn’t explicitly say that the king is naked,” she wrote, “but advised people to look at his clothes.”",

    "source": "High-Tech, Lowered Profile <eos> TRENTON - FOR years, New Jersey has had this understanding: We are rich. We have great jobs. We are the medicine cabinet and the telecommunications nerve center of the world. We have hatched ideas and industries since Edison was recording sound onto tin-foil cylinders in Menlo Park. But just as a new governor steps up, with visions of a state growing its way out of fiscal distress, comes some disquieting news: We are not as rich as we used to be. The highest-paying industries are expanding in other states and countries, while in New Jersey some are actually shrinking. The state's fastest-growing sectors employ motel clerks and nursing home aides. The warnings come from many sources, but the loudest come from two academics at Rutgers, James W. Hughes and Joseph J. Seneca, who have regularly advised the governor and the Legislature on the state's economy. At the State House on Thursday, they drew a dismal picture of job trends. They had already sent out alarms in a report two months ago about a \"startling erosion\" in technology-based industries. That report, written for the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology, documented a decline in the state's share of total national employment in every one of 10 technology-based industry groups. For example, New Jersey had 20 percent of the nation's jobs in the pharmaceutical industry in 1990, yet slipped to 14 percent in 2004. What's more, the state's share of jobs in Internet service and data processing was cut nearly in half. In all, in the five highest-paying sectors -- which include financial activities and federal government jobs, in addition to high-tech businesses -- New Jersey lost 44,000 jobs from 1990 to 2004. Given these numbers, it was perhaps not surprising that in census data released last month, New Jersey had lost its No. 1 rank in median household income, slipping behind Connecticut. Any erosion of New Jersey's brain-based economy is worrisome to a state that in the past had claimed \"genius factories,\" in Mr. Hughes's phrase, like the Bell and the RCA laboratories. And while their shrinkage in a global tech upsurge is well known, many technology experts are taken aback by the bigger picture. \"We've known that this is happening for a while, but now we have real numbers,\" said Sherrie Preische, the director of the science and technology commission, a state agency. \"We certainly didn't know we were below 1990 levels.\" \"Look at where a lot of technology is growing,\" Dr. Preische added. \"A lot of it's in Massachusetts and California. These are not low-cost places.\" As if to drive home the point that other states are eating New Jersey's lunch, at a legislative hearing this month on the fledgling nanotechnology industry, Harch Gill, the general manager of Princeton Nanotech, arrived late with an explanation for his tardiness: he was just returning from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., where he had gone to confer informally with academic researchers. There, he said, he was met by a committee that offered grants, loans and other inducements to move to Pennsylvania. \"These stories are repeated over and over,\" Dr. Preische said. New Jersey is not going the way of Alabama or Arkansas, as Mr. Hughes and Professor Seneca make clear; it is simply edging toward average. The state enjoys per-capita income that is 25 percent higher than the national average, down from 29 percent five years ago, for example. In the long term, economic forecasters say, all states are becoming more average. \"New Jersey should perform just below the average over the long term,\" said Mark Zandi, who is the chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, based in West Chester, Pa. \"The wealthier economies will get a little less wealthy, and the poorer economies will get a little wealthier.\" But 2006 is an especially bad time to become more average, since New Jersey's budget gap of about $6 billion is expected to be one of the worst of any state in the nation. It is no time, politically speaking, to be giving grants, tax breaks and seed money. So a question heard with increasing frequency is this: What is Jon S. Corzine, the governor-elect who spent a professional lifetime in the business of allocating capital, going to do? Mr. Corzine is well aware of the slippage, to judge from statements he issued during his campaign, although the governor-elect's transition team did not respond to several requests for an interview. Mr. Corzine has proposed a venture capital fund, called the Edison Innovation Fund, to be financed initially by bonds and used to aid high-tech enterprises. Mr. Corzine also has the larger job of shoring up the financial industry, salvaging manufacturing jobs and encouraging corporate investment. \"Look, he's a business guy,\" said Anthony Shorris, the director of the Policy Research Institute for the Region at Princeton University. \"He comes out of the environment of the people we're talking about, the world of information technology and financial services. He knows what they need and what it takes to get them to move and stay.\" Mr. Shorris, among others, noted that high-tech enterprises everywhere took a beating starting in 2000 and 2001, and were only recovering now. Adding Up the Pluses Yet the state treasurer, John E. McCormac, saw the state's economy far differently, saying that the overall recovery was filling the state's treasury faster than expected. \"Our corporate tax is way over target,\" Mr. McCormac said in an interview, shrugging dramatically. \"If there's really a problem, why do we keep beating our targets?\" Mr. McCormac pointed out that the Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation was expanding its headquarters in East Hanover, Pfizer was building a new research center in Morris Plains and Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceutical giant, was putting its United States headquarters in Bridgewater. And New Jersey -- going so far as to send Mr. McCormac and Gov. Richard J. Codey to Verizon Communications' headquarters in Manhattan about a year ago -- persuaded the company to take over the former AT&T campus in Basking Ridge rather than move to Virginia. In addition, Mr. McCormac said, a Wall Street surge has fed the state treasury with personal taxes paid on unearned income. \"Those revenues for '04 were great, for '05 were better and for '06 look even better,\" he said. Mr. Hughes replies that Wall Street money is masking losses in the state's economic core. Moreover, jobs in the securities and brokerage firms in New Jersey declined from 2000 to 2004, after a decade in which many companies moved support services across the Hudson. The Hughes-Seneca report said: \"With back-office functions now as easily carried out in low-cost Asia as in Jersey City, the state's recently gained role as a significant national financial center may very well be in jeopardy.\" And sooner rather than later, record-level corporate profits will recede, cutting income tax receipts from the state's wealthiest residents, said Mr. Hughes, who is the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers. While people who bring home big paychecks from Manhattan pay income taxes to New York State, they pay taxes on their unearned income to New Jersey. Mr. Hughes, just like many Republican legislators, contends that the \"millionaire's tax\" adopted in 2004 -- raising taxes on income over $500,000 -- is a highly unreliable source of revenue. Mr. Hughes and Professor Seneca found an overall decline since 2000 in the highest-paying economic sectors, including the corporate management jobs and financial-industry jobs that were largely responsible for the state's high-end housing boom, which is an economic engine in itself. The average pay for what they label \"Wall Street-type jobs\" in 2004 was $131,422. Where the Growth Is At the same time, the highest job gains were in local government, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality --a sector that paid an average of $20,065 a year in 2004. A new state analysis of income tax returns, from its 2003 tax year, yielded a puzzling statistic: The average wage reported was $58,546, which was $13 below the average reported in 2000. There is little disagreement that the state needs to shore up its high-tech supports. \"Other places have caught up,\" said Richard Goldberg, a member of the state's science and technology commission and a vice president of DRS Technologies in Parsippany, which produces electronics systems for the military. Most of the states viewed as competitors for high-tech business lost science and technology jobs in 2001 and 2002. But most lost fewer than New Jersey did, and several have done much better. In scientific research and development services, for example, New Jersey lost more than 4,000 of its 32,000 jobs from 1990 to 2004. The state was leapfrogged during that period by Massachusetts and Maryland, while Virginia and New York rapidly added jobs as well. New Jersey was the first state to commit funds to stem cell research, which helped spur California to adopt a $3 billion initiative. Now, New Jersey has started to spend the money -- which California has not -- announcing $5 million in grants last month. Still, New Jersey remains overshadowed by California and pursued by other states. Other States' Gains Mr. Zandi noted that New Jersey's technology sector had been dominated by very large corporations, especially the pharmaceutical companies and telecommunications giants like AT&T. \"In the case of Maryland or California, a lot of the growth was in biotech, medical instrumentation, in small and midsize companies,\" he said. \"Big companies generally are not experiencing the same kinds of growth rates and hiring in the same way.\" He then raised and answered his own question: \"Why is it that New Jersey hasn't been able to attract small biotech companies? That may be because the state has underinvested in its university facilities. California, Maryland, Virginia are extraordinarily aggressive in bringing these companies to their states.\" To stem the tide, Mr. Goldberg advocates more technology incubators -- state-financed facilities that offer laboratory space -- for start-up companies. \"Pennsylvania and New York have over 50 incubators each, and New Jersey has 8,\" he said. \"We've done a poor job of growing that system because it costs money.\" Professor Seneca and Dean Hughes met with Mr. Corzine on Thursday, before their presentation at the State House, and found him, as Professor Seneca said, \"very sharp in his understanding and penetrating with the questions.\" The science and technology commission, in preparing recommendations for Mr. Corzine, is urging a $300 million commitment for the Edison fund and $20 million to $50 million a year for more short-term programs. One model is New York State's new research center at the State University at Albany, which focuses on nanotechnology. The state has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into its development and has attracted billions in private investment from companies like IBM and International Sematech. New Jersey has given only scattered grants to nanotechnology companies, although it is one of the handful of fields that the science commission wants to emphasize. The Value of Education No high-tech company, of course, can do without a highly educated labor pool, even if it is in a high-cost state -- and it usually is. \"The fundamental things don't turn around quickly, and New Jersey is coming at this from a very good position,\" Mr. Shorris said. \"They're not putting Pfizer research labs in North Dakota or Mississippi.\" For recruiting purposes, he added, it would be nice to have Boston or Chicago in the middle of the state. But New Jersey is blessed, he said, by its nearness to two very attractive metro areas. And Mr. Hughes said it had never been hard to persuade people to live in Princeton or Short Hills or to commute from Manhattan. In fact, New Jersey probably has a harder time recruiting and keeping other types of businesses. In a survey of members of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association last fall, more than 90 percent said New Jersey had higher taxes and fees, health-care costs and government spending than other states. Another report released last month by the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce said relocation consultants who work around the nation reported that their clients rarely even considered the state. Some had lukewarm compliments for the state's Business Employment Incentive Program, which is intended to persuade employers to create new jobs in New Jersey by giving to them a portion of the state income taxes paid by each newly hired employee. The state's business-growth programs are now scattered in more than a dozen departments and agencies, and Mr. Corzine has said he wants to bring them all under the Economic Development Authority, the independent agency that handles the larger employment incentive program. To help achieve this, the governor-elect has appointed an advisory panel on economic development, which has been meeting throughout the transition period. One member, John Galandak, the president of the Commerce and Industry Association of New Jersey, said Mr. Corzine spent two and a half hours with the committee at its last meeting, although he said he could not give details of the discussions. \"With the incoming administration facing a $6 billion budget gap, there's not going to be a lot of latitude or political will to give grants or more money,\" Mr. Galandak said. The incentives, he said, would have to come in the form of an easier tax and regulatory burden. The Chamber of Commerce report did cite New Jersey's competitive advantages, including the quality of its work force, as identified in interviews with corporate executives and consultants.

    "source": "Timofey Mozgov Comes Off Bench to Lead Knicks <eos> The long, frequently frustrating search for a productive, skilled big man led the Knicks to a dozen dead ends before ending, finally, back where it began: in the Russian-speaking quarter of the locker room. Necessity called, and Timofey Mozgov — his English and his game improving in lockstep — provided a bold reminder of why the Knicks found him so intriguing in the first place. He ran hard, dunked harder and took care of all the loose ends Sunday night, leading the depleted Knicks to a 124-106 rout of the Detroit Pistons at Madison Square Garden. For Mozgov, a soft-spoken rookie, there was quiet satisfaction as he posted career highs in points (23), rebounds (14) and minutes (40). For the fans, there was happy delirium, and chants of “Moz-gov!” after he scored his final points on a 19-foot jumper. For the Knicks (25-22) , there was relief. They needed this victory over the woebegone Pistons (17-31). And they need an imposing, hustling, rebounding 7-footer to fill out this rotation if they hope to make any noise in the postseason. Mozgov, 23, had not played in the previous 10 games, and hardly at all since mid-November, when he lost the starting center job. There is no keeping him out now. “Twenty-three and 14?” Coach Mike D’Antoni said, chuckling. “I think I’ll try it again.” The opportunity came Sunday because of injury (Wilson Chandler’s sore calf), suspension (Shawne Williams) and foul trouble (Ronny Turiaf). Chandler and Williams are both expected back for Wednesday’s game against the Dallas Mavericks, but the rotation will need another adjustment. Mozgov is the Knicks’ only 7-footer and earned an opening night start after a strong training camp. He struggled in the season’s opening weeks and soon fell out of the rotation. “But we always liked him,” D’Antoni said. “That’s why he started the year. We thought he had that potential.” The difference now? “He just wasn’t flustered,” D’Antoni said. “It just seemed like he was going way too fast earlier.” The Knicks needed everything Mozgov provided to hold off Detroit and the hot-shooting Ben Gordon (35 points). The Pistons shot 50.6 percent and led by 8 in the third quarter, but the Knicks held them to 15 points in the fourth quarter. Amar’e Stoudemire led the Knicks with 33 points. Danilo Gallinari added 29 points, making 7 of 12 field goals and all 11 of his free throws. For the second straight game, Stoudemire spent a few disturbing moments wincing on the court, this time after bumping his left knee in the fourth quarter. He limped and hopped a bit but stayed in the game. Stoudemire was already coping with a sprained right knee, an injury he sustained Friday in Atlanta. Stoudemire started anyway and played effectively, if not always with his usual verve. He grabbed only six rebounds in 39 minutes. Stoudemire conceded that he was “trying to save my legs a little bit” in the first half but said that his knees were fine — “No worries.” Mozgov alleviated any other concerns, by cleaning up all the missed shots. “He played great,” Stoudemire said. “He’s one of those players where he keeps working, and keeps trying to improve as a young player.” Anthony Randolph also rejoined the rotation Sunday, but with more modest results: five rebounds, one block and no points in 8 minutes 30 seconds. He is likely to return to the bench when Chandler and Williams return. Mozgov showed much more poise than he did in November. After missing his first three attempts Sunday — nervously flinging two shots long — he settled down and found a rhythm. He slammed through two putbacks and dunked a lob from Toney Douglas. “I just breathed a little bit,” Mozgov said, exhaling loudly for effect, “and tried to play aggressive, that’s it.” In Russia, the fans used to chant his full name. But he appreciated the enthusiastic chants of his last name. “I feel really, really excited,” he said. “Thank you, the fans.” REBOUNDS Mark Warkentien, a veteran N.B.A. executive, will soon be hired as a Knicks front-office consultant, reporting to the team president Donnie Walsh, a person briefed on the matter confirmed. Yahoo Sports first reported the news Sunday. The highly regarded Warkentien was let go as the Denver Nuggets’ general manager last summer. He shares an agent with Walsh and has long been rumored as a possible right-hand man and, perhaps, eventual successor. Warkentien’s ties to the Nuggets could in theory help the Knicks’ in their pursuit of Carmelo Anthony. Walsh declined to comment on the Warkentien news, saying, “I have nothing to report.”",

    "source": "In ‘Love & Math,’ Fighting Discrimination Through Numbers <eos> In 1984, when he was 16, Edward Frenkel was subjected to a malicious interrogation. Already a brilliant budding mathematician, he had applied for admission to “Mekh-Mat” at Moscow State University, the top mathematics program in the Soviet Union. But when he attended the critical oral entrance exam, his dream of becoming a professional mathematician came crashing down. He quickly solved the problems presented to him, but the examiners studiously ignored him, paying attention to the other students. Finally, an hour into the exam, his special inquisitors arrived and began hammering him with questions. Each correct answer was parsed and questioned in minute detail, and new problems, far beyond the required level, were presented in rapid succession. Dr. Frenkel fought on, but didn’t stand a chance: in 1984, no Jewish student, no matter how gifted, could be admitted to Mekh-Mat. Mathematical brilliance was no match for institutional anti-Semitism. In many ways “Love & Math” is his response to that moment. For Dr. Frenkel, as he recounts in the autobiographical chapters of the book, did not give up. He continued his studies in a less prestigious (and less anti-Semitic) applied mathematics program, but his true education took place elsewhere. He tapped an informal network of mathematicians, many of them Jewish, who were denied employment in their field but kept up their work at the highest level. With their guidance, Dr. Frenkel was soon conducting groundbreaking research. When the government finally relaxed its restrictions on international travel, he was invited to Harvard on a short-term fellowship that later turned into a permanent appointment. A few years after being denied admission to the undergraduate program at Mekh-Mat, he was a rising international star in the world of mathematics. The story of his professional triumph against heavy odds is deeply satisfying, especially when he is given the opportunity to confront his former tormentors during a seminar at M.I.T. But his true answer to the bigotry he encountered in his youth lies in his passion for mathematics — the “love” of the book’s title. Image Love & Math The Heart of Hidden Reality. By Edward Frenkel.Basic Books. 292 pages. $27.99. The truths of mathematics, as he explains, are objective, eternal and unchanging, residing in a perfect Platonic universe where prejudice and vindictiveness hold no sway. In the Orwellian world of the Soviet state, mathematics offered a haven in which truth stood for itself, free from ideological orthodoxy or the whims of the powerful. The anti-Semites at Mekh-Mat might have crushed young Edward’s dreams of an academic career, but against the truths of mathematics, they were helpless. Now a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Frenkel specializes in the Langlands program , an ambitious effort to unify the disparate areas of research in modern mathematics. The world of math, to use one of his favorite metaphors, is made up of different continents, seemingly isolated from one another: Number theory is about the properties of numbers, harmonic analysis is concerned with the properties of wave functions, the study of Riemann surfaces deals with the geometries of two-dimensional manifolds, and so on. The Langlands program draws connections among several of these “continents” by revealing startling similarities in their structures. To Dr. Frenkel, these unexpected analogies suggest that the different fields are just the visible manifestations of a deep mathematical truth that remains hidden beneath the surface. His quest is to reveal this universal structure. He does his best to explain the substance of his work to the lay reader, but this, he admits, is no easy task. Galois groups , Kac-Moody algebras, Hitchin moduli spaces, A-branes, automorphic sheaves and other concepts that are the tools of his trade are bound to challenge even the most dedicated nonmathematician. Impressively, he does not give up. Believing that mathematics is a common human possession, he explains each concept in nontechnical terms, relying heavily on analogies from daily life. In the end, lay readers will probably acquire no more than a superficial sense of all this technical work. But far more important, they will gain an understanding of what modern mathematics is about — its ambition, its beauty and its power to enthrall. Is mathematics truly as universal, eternal and unchanging as Dr. Frenkel believes? The history of the field suggests that it may not be, that mathematics could, in fact, be quite different in different times and places. The idea that different geometries can describe spaces different from our own, for example, is self-evident to a modern mathematician, but would have seemed sheer nonsense to any practitioner before the 19th century. Conversely, the fast and loose methods of the early pioneers of the calculus would be completely unacceptable in the modern field. And Dr. Frenkel’s own experience in the Soviet Union makes it clear that mathematics is not entirely insulated from the political pressures of its day. But this matters little. “Love & Math” is not a detached philosophical overview of mathematics but a report from the trenches by a practicing mathematician at the forefront of the field. And as such it is powerful, passionate and inspiring. In 2010, Dr. Frenkel appeared in a short film he wrote, “Rites of Love and Math,” in which a mathematician tattoos the “formula of love” on the body of his beloved, to save it and prevent it from falling into evil hands. It is perhaps Dr. Frenkel’s ultimate answer to the trauma of his youth. The truths of mathematics cannot be erased; they live on, safe from the malignant designs of humans. In the world of mathematics the bullies of Mekh-Mat wouldn’t stand a chance.",

    "source": "Australian Ends Attempt to Prove He Founded Bitcoin <eos> LONDON — The mystery behind who created the online currency Bitcoin deepened on Thursday. Craig Steven Wright, an Australian entrepreneur and computer programmer who earlier this week said he was that person, on Thursday withdrew an offer to prove his assertion, removing the contents of his blog and replacing it with a post simply titled, “I’m sorry.” “I believed that I could do this,” Mr. Wright wrote on his blog. “I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot.” Mr. Wright was first identified as Bitcoin’s founder in December 2015 by Wired magazine and the technology website Gizmodo, but he did not come forward then. This week that changed, and he said in interviews with the BBC, The Economist and GQ that he was the digital currency’s creator , known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Almost as soon as Mr. Wright announced he was the creator of Bitcoin on Monday, skepticism surfaced in the Bitcoin community about the authenticity of his claims. In a news release on Monday, Mr. Wright said that he had decided to make his identity public to “dispel any negative myths and fears about Bitcoin.” “I cannot allow the misinformation that has been spread to impact the future of Bitcoin” and the blockchain, the currency’s communal digital ledger, he said at the time. “I’m now able to build on what I have previously completed by releasing my research and academic work and help people understand just how powerful this can really be.” Outside Organization, a public relations company that distributed his release on Monday, verified that the comments on the blog were from Mr. Wright and did not provide any additional comment on Thursday. Bitcoin was founded as a digital competitor to existing currencies, and it has gained traction as financial institutions and others have begun researching how they can use the blockchain technology to improve transactions. The currency is created by people using computers to solve complex math problems, and it can then be traded digitally. Each coin is associated with its owner by a digital key. The mysterious identity of its founder created an aura around the digital currency since it surfaced in 2009 and fueled a parlor game of speculation about Satoshi Nakamoto’s identify. Satoshi Nakamoto communicated only by electronic message and never revealed his or her true identity before ending all communication in 2011. To verify his assertions this week, the BBC said, Mr. Wright provided digitally signed messages using cryptographic keys inextricably linked to Bitcoins generated by Satoshi Nakamoto. Mr. Wright also posted evidence on his blog, including a technical walk-through of how to verify cryptographic keys. All of that information was wiped from his blog on Thursday. “When the rumors began, my qualifications and character were attacked,” Mr. Wright said on his blog on Thursday. “When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun. I know now that I am not strong enough for this.” In his post on Thursday, Mr. Wright apologized to Jon Matonis, one of the founding directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, and Gavin Andresen, who succeeded Satoshi Nakamoto as the lead Bitcoin developer. Both men said on Monday that, after reviewing evidence provided by Mr. Wright, they believed that he was Satoshi Nakamoto. “I can only hope that their honor and credibility is not irreparably tainted by my actions,” Mr. Wright said on his blog. “They were not deceived, but I know that the world will never believe that now. I can only say I’m sorry.” After the Wired and Gizmodo articles last year, Australian Federal Police raided Mr. Wright’s home in a suburb of Sydney in connection with a tax investigation. Tax authorities in Australia said at the time that they had determined that Mr. Wright was not Satoshi Nakamoto. On Thursday, Mr. Wright seemed determined to return to the shadows, ending his post with the words, “And goodbye.”",

    "source": "The Fight over Prices on the Internet <eos> Where’s the price? On some pages of e-commerce sites selling products like televisions, digital cameras and jewelry, a critical piece of information is conspicuously missing: the price tag. To see how much these items cost, shoppers must add the merchandise to their shopping carts — in effect, taking it up to the virtual register for a price check. The missing prices are part of a larger battle sweeping the world of e-commerce. Wary of the Internet’s tendency to relentlessly drive down prices, major brands and manufacturers — and now, book publishers — are striking back, deploying a variety of tactics and tools to control how their products are presented and priced online. “You are seeing firms of all types test the waters” with strategies to control online pricing, said Christopher Sprigman, associate professor of intellectual property at the University of Virginia School of Law and a former antitrust lawyer at the Justice Department. “They feel they have more freedom to do it now.” In many cases that freedom stems from a 2007 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Leegin Creative Leather Products v. PSKS. The ruling gave manufacturers considerably more leeway to dictate retail prices, once considered a violation of antitrust law, and it set a high legal hurdle for retailers to prove that this is bad for consumers. Ever since that decision, retailers say manufacturers have become increasingly aggressive with one tool in particular: forbidding retailers from advertising their products for anything less than a certain price. For offline retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and Best Buy, that means not dropping below those prices in the circulars and ads in newspapers. But online retailers have a greater burden. Manufacturers consider the product pages on sites like eBay and Amazon.com to be ads, and they complain whenever e-commerce sites set prices below the minimum price. This leads the sites to replace prices with notes that say things like “To see our price, add this item to your cart.” One day last week, prices were missing on Amazon.com for an array of products like the Milwaukee Sub-Compact Driver drill kit, a Movado men’s Esperanza watch and an Onkyo 7.2-channel home theater receiver. As a result, those prices also did not show up on search sites like Google Product Search and PriceGrabber.com . The trend has arguably weakened one of the implicit promises of e-commerce: that quick searches and visits to comparison shopping sites will yield the best deals. Most online retailers complain that the missing prices confuse consumers and give an advantage to big chains like Wal-Mart, which do not bear the same burden in their stores. They also say the practice of enforcing minimum advertised prices has gradually spread from the consumer electronics business to companies in other industries like sporting goods and jewelry, which are also trying to stem the downward pressure of prices online. Amazon declined to comment on the issue, but the company’s feelings on the matter are public. “Retailers like Amazon have the legal right to set their own prices independently, but some manufacturers place restrictions on how those prices may be communicated,” reads an explanation on Amazon product pages that lack prices. “We realize that this is an inconvenience and are regularly working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact our customers.” A few online retailers, like Buy.com, say advertising restrictions have not measurably affected sales. But most other e-commerce companies volubly protest. “We think consumers are best served when the retail marketplace is open and transparent and retailers have an opportunity to offer the best prices and services, and are not controlled from above by manufacturers,” said Brian Bieron, eBay’s senior director for domestic government relations. Manufacturers, of course, have a different view. They say the competitiveness of the Internet has unlocked a race to the bottom — with everyone from large corporations to garage-based sellers ravenously discounting products, and even selling them at a loss, in an effort to capture market share and attention from search engines and comparison shopping sites. They also worry that their largest retail partners may be unwilling to match the online price cuts and could stop carrying their products altogether. “If there isn’t that back-and-forth between manufacturer and retailer, it’s just a natural tendency to drive the price down to nothing,” said Wes Shepherd, chief of Channel Velocity, which sells software that allows companies to scour the Web looking for violations of pricing agreements. Southern Audio Services, based in Baton Rouge, La., sets a suggested retail price of $80 for its Woodees Inner-Ear Stereo Earphones, while their minimum advertised price is $50. Most online retailers sell them for around $50, but Amazon sells them for $48.40, keeping the price off the product page. “At the end of the day, it will become a race to zero if you don’t do anything to manage the issue,” said Jon C. Jordan, chief executive of Southern Audio Services. “Then you’ve devalued your product to the point where it’s difficult to get distribution and consumers lose interest in it.” The battle may shift back to Washington. Companies like eBay and Amazon are asking Congress to override aspects of the Leegin ruling. One bill that would repeal provisions of the ruling is now being considered in the House. In October, 41 state attorneys general wrote a letter to members of the House Judiciary Committee, arguing that the court’s decision had resulted in higher prices for shoppers. Just like other product makers, book publishers have also been emboldened by the Leegin decision. In their case, they want to prevent low prices on electronic books from cannibalizing their more profitable hardcover sales. Instead of selling e-books wholesale to retailers like Amazon.com, the publishers want to sell them directly, setting prices and having the retailer act as an agent, taking a fixed 30 percent commission. Macmillan recently struck such an agreement with Amazon.com after a protracted dispute that led Amazon to remove, briefly, Macmillan’s electronic and physical books from its site. Deals with the other major publishers will most likely follow. Book publishers “are using a different set of levers, and a different vocabulary, to get what they want,” said Scot Wingo, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, which helps companies sell online. “But it’s the same outcome. Manufacturers are effectively controlling the price that the consumer sees on the Web.”",

    "source": "Tense Search, Chilling Note and an Arrest in Brooklyn Stabbings <eos> Around 8 p.m. Wednesday, a man paused at a corner in Ozone Park, Queens, and scrawled letters and symbols on a stop sign: $Killzz I will BK At the bottom he drew a smiley face, one eye winking. A moment later, two detectives stepped up and called the man by name: Daniel St. Hubert. He was placed under arrest, and the police now believe he committed a string of shocking crimes between Friday and Wednesday morning. He was carrying a brown-handled knife in his waistband and a cellphone in his pocket, said Stephen Davis, the Police Department’s chief spokesman. The words on that stop sign — since removed — were the last traces that the police found of Mr. St. Hubert, 27, as they tracked him from the scene of one slashing to the next: an 18-year-old woman, killed in the East New York section of Brooklyn on Friday night as she was going to meet her friends after band practice. A short distance away on Sunday afternoon, two children set upon as they rode the elevator on their way to get a treat — a 6-year-old boy knifed to death and a 7-year-old girl slashed within an inch of her life. And near dawn Wednesday, a 53-year-old homeless man on a subway platform in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, stabbed and slashed as he slept on a bench. As of late Thursday, Mr. St. Hubert had been charged with the attacks on the children. At nearly every step in three boroughs, the authorities said, Mr. St. Hubert left digital and physical evidence, all of which began to be unlocked midday Wednesday in an eight-hour avalanche of revelations. Around noon, a laboratory report on the knife used in the Sunday elevator attack came back with Mr. St. Hubert’s DNA profile, which was in a state database. It was the first time detectives had a name for their suspect. They obtained the number of a cellphone that he was using, and tracked its beacon signal as he moved around the city Wednesday afternoon and evening. Early on, it showed that he was on Queens Boulevard, but the signal disappeared. Assuming that he had gone into the subway system, the chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, ordered investigators to scramble to stations along the E line, hoping to see Mr. St. Hubert as he emerged, but the next sign of his whereabouts came when his phone signal was detected on a street in Queens, several blocks from the subway. Investigators rushed to the neighborhood, but again saw no sign of him. As they were speaking with people on the street, they noticed a camera outside a store, Mr. Davis said. Its hard drive showed that a few minutes earlier, Mr. St. Hubert had walked right past. “I was very excited, because now we have a real-time picture of him, how he looks, and what he is wearing,” Mr. Davis said. That included black sneakers, a gray shirt and blue shorts — fitting the description of clothing worn by a man seen fleeing the housing project where the children were stabbed on Sunday. It also showed he had a tattoo of a ram’s head and the word Aries. The video was obtained while Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William J. Bratton were giving a news conference to publicize the hunt. Moments later, the two detectives arrested Mr. St. Hubert after seeing him write on the stop sign. “Ordinarily, you would call for backup, but they did not want to wait and take any chances with him,” Mr. Davis said. “He was cooperative.” Mr. St. Hubert’s MetroCard showed him entering a subway station in Chelsea around the time of the slashing. In the case of the 18-year-old woman who was stabbed in Brooklyn, lab tests have found physical evidence that was consistent with Mr. St. Hubert’s DNA, but it has not been linked to him with certainty. Investigators believe signals from his phone place him in the vicinity of the crime. There are only grainy video images of that assault, but they show that after a few initial thrusts with the knife, the man continued with multiple shallow stabs. That is similar to the pattern of attacks in the elevator and the subway, authorities said. Mr. St. Hubert has spent much of his time in custody sleeping. During his waking hours, his conversation has rambled, with references to Satan, but has also been coherent at times, one investigator said. Five years ago, Mr. St. Hubert’s mother, Marie Bauzile, told prosecutors in Queens that she did not want them to proceed with a criminal case against her son after he wrapped an electric cord around her neck, took $1,000 and stole her Toyota. He was 22 years old and she already had an order of protection against him. Her son needed psychiatric care, not prison, Ms. Bauzile told an assistant district attorney, according to Kevin Ryan, a spokesman for the Queens district attorney’s office. Nevertheless, he was charged with attempted murder, and because the crime was so violent, the case was not sent to a special mental health court, Mr. Ryan said. It would be three years before the charges were resolved. On three separate occasions, Mr. St. Hubert was committed to a state psychiatric hospital because he was found to be unfit to stand trial. In June 2012, he pleaded guilty to attempted murder and an assault on a corrections officer. Because of that conviction, he had to provide a sample of his DNA. In late May, he was released from prison. Less than two weeks later, a trace of evidence on a knife led to his DNA profile in the state database.",

    "source": "For Rhesus Macaques, to Know Her May Mean to Love Her <eos> Among rhesus macaques, a female’s face becomes darker when she ovulates, and males can pick up the signal — but some males get the message more clearly than others. Researchers writing online Wednesday in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B have found experimental evidence that males are much better at picking up signals from females they already know than from those they are unfamiliar with. The scientists tested free-ranging male macaques in Puerto Rico by presenting them with images of females’ faces during fertile and infertile periods. Males who already knew the females gazed longer at the darker faces of the fertile period, suggesting that they were getting the point. Those who were from other groups, and therefore unfamiliar with the females, showed no more interest in the fertile than in the nonfertile. The researchers speculate that it is not a darker face alone that attracts a male, but how comparatively dark a familiar female’s face gets as she becomes fertile. To make that judgment, the male must already know the female. The lead author of the study, Dr. James P. Higham, who was with the University of Chicago when the research was done but is now at the German Primate Center in Göttingen, said that humans seem to face the same problem in interpreting nonverbal communication. “If you don’t know the range of signals an individual gives off, it’s hard to know what they mean,” he said. “I don’t think these things have been studied in humans, but it’s the sort of effect that seems intuitive.”",

    "source": "Mariners and Top Pick Are Thinking Big <eos> Phillippe Aumont is big — 6-foot-7 big. He talks big, beyond his 18 years. And based on his potential, on how much the Mariners are gushing over him and on Seattle’s most recent history with its top draft choice, Aumont should be thinking big, too. It is not a stretch to think that Aumont, an 18-year-old Canadian and the 11th overall selection in June’s draft, may join Brandon Morrow, the Mariners’ top pick last year, and the 21-year-old ace Félix Hernández as part of a flame-throwing rotation in Seattle soon. Why? “I’ll start with: 6-foot-7, 225 pounds,” said Wayne Norton, the Mariners’ scouting supervisor for Canada, drawing a room full of laughs as Aumont was being introduced Friday after signing a contract with a $1.9 million signing bonus. “Then, he throws in the mid-90s.” So does Morrow, selected fifth over all out of the University of California 14 months ago. Morrow, 23, pitched one game at Class A last fall before finding himself in the Mariners’ bullpen this season. Seattle is expected to put him in its rotation to begin next season. Aumont noticed. “It’s a fun thing to know that a pitcher they drafted in the first round last year ended up playing in the big leagues right away,” said Aumont, the highest Canadian selected in the major league draft since 2002, when Baltimore chose Adam Loewen fourth over all and Colorado took Jeff Francis ninth. “The thing is, he’s a college guy, so he’s older,” Aumont said of Morrow. “I can probably do it, too. But I don’t want to rush things.” The temptation could be there for the Mariners. Aumont, a native of Gatineau, Québec, throws his fastball up to 97 miles an hour. His sinking two-seam fastball routinely zooms at 93 or 94. “How many guys can hit that velocity now in the major leagues?” said Dan Lawson, Aumont’s agent. “One per staff, maybe.” But Aumont began playing baseball only four years ago. He did not begin considering a career in professional baseball until early last year — about the time he refused an invitation to join a top all-star team of high school basketball players in Québec to concentrate on being a pitcher. The Mariners equate Aumont’s experience pitching for the Canadian junior team, which he will rejoin for tournaments in Illinois and Mexico through Sept. 1, to a player with community college or rookie-level minor league experience in the United States. So he has some developing — and proving — to do before he reaches Seattle. Next month, he will join Mariners instructional league prospects in Arizona. Then in February, the Mariners will invite him to their spring training camp, as they do each spring after signing their top pick. They extended the same opportunity to Morrow as a nonroster invitee this spring — and he blew them and the Cactus League away to win a roster spot. “There’s more to come,” Norton said of Aumont. “I think he’s obviously going to get bigger, stronger.” Norton projected Aumont to be a front-of-the-rotation power pitcher. Norton said he had scouted some of Canada’s best, going back to Loewen and Francis, “who are doing quite well right now. This guy doesn’t take a back seat to those two gentlemen. “I want to take the opportunity to thank him. Guys like him make scouting easy.”",

    "source": "3 Rikers Officials Charged in Brutal Beating of Inmate <eos> Two New York City correction officers and a captain were arrested Wednesday on charges that they handcuffed and beat an inmate unconscious with a baton at Rikers Island and then falsified documents to cover it up, the authorities said. The arrests were part of a monthslong inquiry by the city’s Investigation Department into “a pattern of lawless conduct at Rikers that must be brought under control,” Mark G. Peters, the department commissioner, said in a statement. “The victims here were not simply the injured inmate but the justice system itself, which cannot properly function when sworn law enforcement officers falsify documents to cover up crimes,” Mr. Peters said. The captain, Moises Simancas, 43, who has nearly 17 years’ experience, and the two correction officers, April Jackson, 34, and Tyrone Wint, 28, who were both hired in 2008, were each charged with attempted first-degree assault, which carries a maximum of 15 years in prison. They were also charged with falsifying business records, among other offenses. They were arraigned on Wednesday in State Supreme Court in the Bronx and released on $50,000 bail each. All three were removed from contact with inmates after the beating and were suspended after their arrests. The beating occurred on Oct. 30, 2012, just after Hurricane Sandy. Tensions were high after the storm, according to a statement by the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson. Rikers was short-staffed and inmates had been locked in their cells for much longer than usual because of the storm. At the George R. Vierno Center, one of the 10 jails at Rikers, an inmate named Gabino Genao became verbally abusive to one of the defendants, officials said. In response, the defendants went into Mr. Genao’s cell, handcuffed him from behind and led him to a vestibule, “where one of the officers allegedly threw the first punch, but missed when the inmate ducked,” Mr. Johnson said. The officers then pushed Mr. Genao to the floor, and all three began to punch and kick him in the head, neck and torso, officials said. At one point, one of the officers grabbed a baton and hit him multiple times. He then lost consciousness. Mr. Genao, now 27, suffered multiple contusions that officials said were consistent with the imprint of a standard-issue baton used by the Correction Department. He had been incarcerated for a parole violation. After the beating, officers submitted reports that omitted the use of the baton and were “inconsistent with both the assault of the inmate and the injuries he sustained,” the Investigation Department said. The beating was part of a pattern of brutality, neglect and corruption among correction officers and supervisors that officials say is rampant at Rikers Island. Several recent deaths, including a homeless veteran who died in an overheated cell in February, have prompted fresh scrutiny of the city’s jails. Mayor Bill de Blasio has vowed reforms, particularly to treatment of inmates with mental illnesses, who have surged into Rikers in recent years and suffer abuse disproportionally. Jail beatings rarely result in prosecution, but there are exceptions. In June last year, the Bronx district attorney’s office charged 10 jail officers and supervisors, including a former Rikers security chief, with savagely beating an inmate and then conspiring to cover up the attack. The inmate, Jahmal Lightfoot, suffered two fractured eye sockets and a broken nose. After the beating, officers then accused Mr. Lightfoot — wrongfully, according to prosecutors — of slashing one of the officers with a makeshift razor. The three arrested on Wednesday are among at least 12 correction workers referred for prosecution as part of an Investigation Department inquiry into contraband smuggling, brutality and corruption at Rikers Island. Last month, 22 people were arrested, including two correction officers, in a contraband sweep . The Investigation Department said Wednesday that more arrests were expected.",

    "source": "This Time, Error Benefits Cardinals <eos> BOSTON — The St. Louis Cardinals returned to playing the brand of baseball they cherish: clean and crisp, coolheaded and clutch. And it still was not working. Still they trailed by a run in the seventh inning, thanks to a go-ahead home run by the irksome Boston Red Sox slugger David Ortiz, sinking toward a two-games-to-none deficit in the World Series. So they took a chance — a double steal, with one out, putting two runners in scoring position and pressuring the Red Sox’ defense. And in a redemptive twist, Boston proceeded to throw away its lead Thursday, one night after the Cardinals’ defensive miscues were the focus in Game 1. The result was a 4-2 victory for St. Louis at Fenway Park, evening this World Series at one game apiece and affirming that, yes, the Cardinals can loosen up in the spotlight and, yes, the Red Sox can be beaten on this stage. It had not happened since October 1986, Game 7 against the Mets — a streak of nine consecutive Boston victories in the World Series — but St. Louis had seen and heard just about enough of all that. “The guys stayed aggressive,” Cardinals Manager Mike Matheny said. “That’s the difference between yesterday and today. You saw the aggressiveness offensively.” It was to be expected that the Cardinals, considered among the soundest teams in baseball with 97 regular-season wins, would regroup after Wednesday’s defensive collapse: three errors that ushered in three unearned runs during the Cardinals’ unsightly 8-1 loss. Matheny called it a wake-up call and said his players were embarrassed by their lackluster Series debut. For good measure, he replaced the struggling shortstop Pete Kozma, who committed two errors, and center fielder Shane Robinson, who bobbled a ball, in the Cardinals’ lineup. Image Pete Kozma scored in the seventh, with Jarrod Saltalamacchia unable to corral the ball. Then came a throwing error. Credit Jared Wickerham/Getty Images The result was a near-flawless defensive effort, and a plucky offensive performance that did not wilt after the homer by Ortiz in the sixth tarnished another sensational Michael Wacha performance. In the seventh, the Cardinals put two runners aboard with one out against Boston reliever Craig Breslow, with Kozma pinch-running for David Freese at second base. On a 2-2 pitch to Daniel Descalso, Kozma broke for third (with Jon Jay trailing him to second) and both players reached without a throw after Boston catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia bobbled the pitch. Jay said the steal call was not something issued from the dugout; Kozma read the situation on his own, and Jay alertly followed. “It’s one of those situations where I know he might take a chance and go for it,” Jay said. After Descalso walked, Matt Carpenter hit a fly ball deep enough to left field to score Kozma on a sacrifice fly, as the throw from Jonny Gomes skittered a bit up the first-base line. But after backing up the throw, Breslow tried to nab Jay, who was advancing to third. His throw sailed into the photographers’ pen along the left-field line, allowing Jay to jog in with the go-ahead run while Descalso moved to third. Carlos Beltran, back in the lineup after a bruised rib knocked him out of Game 1, drove in the third run in the inning with a single to right. It was the second time in the game that St. Louis held a lead — noteworthy, considering that in 2004, the Cardinals trailed Boston in every inning of the four-game sweep that ended the Red Sox’ 86-year title drought. The Cardinals did not have Wacha then — he was 13 years old — but the rookie right-hander continued his dominating postseason run on Thursday, limiting the Red Sox to two hits in his first five innings. Only one player on the Red Sox had faced Wacha before, and that was Will Middlebrooks, in high school in Texarkana, Tex. At one point they were teammates on an American Legion squad. Whatever scouting report Middlebrooks could have provided from those memories served little use on Thursday. Wacha, now 22, with his own deep and dark playoff beard, seemed as comfortable as he might have looked on those playing fields of East Texas. Image The Cardinals rookie Michael Wacha had another sensational performance, although his 20-inning scoreless streak was snapped in the sixth. Credit Jared Wickerham/Getty Images His fastball seemed to explode off the top of his 6-foot-6 frame, mixed with a changeup that died off his fingertips. The potent Boston offense that bombarded St. Louis for eight runs on Wednesday was muzzled early. Wacha, only the 11th player age 22 or younger to start a World Series game, struggled with his command at times, and the Red Sox’ patience soon became a factor. Boston’s hitters drew four walks, including Dustin Pedroia with one out in the sixth. The next batter, Ortiz, worked the count full before homering over the Green Monster in left, on a changeup, Wacha’s 103rd pitch. “I made a mistake,” Wacha said, “and he made me pay.” That snapped a 20-inning scoreless streak for Wacha, a postseason record for a rookie, dating to the solo homer he surrendered to Pittsburgh’s Pedro Alvarez in the eighth inning of Game 4 of the National League division series. It also halted Wacha’s bid to match Jon Lester’s shutdown performance the night before, a start that drew additional scrutiny Thursday after speculation flickered on social media outlets that Lester had doctored his pitches. The hubbub began when a Cardinals minor leaguer posted a screen shot on his Twitter account that showed what appeared to be a greenish substance inside Lester’s glove. Red Sox Manager John Farrell wound up addressing the matter along with Lester, who said the discoloration was caused by resin, which helps pitchers maintain their grip on a ball. Matheny said the Cardinals never instigated the matter or questioned anything about Lester’s glove or uniform. “We don’t deny that some things have been acknowledged,” Matheny said before the game. “And if that’s what he claims, then that’s what it is. That’s all there is to it. And right now, it’s pretty much a dead issue.” The matter receded quickly once the game — a tense and taut affair throughout — got under way. The Red Sox threatened a final time in the eighth. With Jacoby Ellsbury on first, the Cardinals left in the right-hander Carlos Martinez to pitch to Ortiz, who singled to center. The next batter, Mike Napoli, popped out to shortstop to end the inning. The night before, that ball might have dropped safely or been bobbled or botched by Cardinals players who continually tripped themselves up. Instead, they realigned the series with a reminder of how they reached this point. “We’re just worried about playing our kind of baseball,” Jay said. “That’s what we did today.” s.",

    "source": "Unable to Match Success of Elway Era, Shanahan Is Fired by Broncos <eos> Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan spent a decade trying to duplicate the championships he brought to Denver with John Elway as his quarterback. Winning only one playoff game since Elway retired, and knocked out of the playoff hunt again with a season-closing three-game losing streak, Shanahan was fired on Tuesday by Pat Bowlen, the team owner. Shanahan had the second-longest tenure among N.F.L. coaches, behind Jeff Fisher of Tennessee. His dismissal further rocks a rapidly spinning coaching carousel, where four coaches have been fired and several more anxiously await word of their fate. Shanahan should find plenty of suitors if he decides to step immediately into another job. His Super Bowl rings, his reputation as an offensive innovator and his relatively young age (56) make him an attractive candidate to the Jets, the Browns and the Lions. A turn in college football is not out of the question, either. Shanahan seriously considered becoming the coach at Florida in 2002, a job that ultimately went to Ron Zook. Shanahan’s spot in the Colorado landscape was long considered as secure as that of Pikes Peak. Revered for lifting the Broncos and Elway from perennial contender to Super Bowl champions after the 1997 and 1998 seasons, Shanahan earned enough good will for Bowlen to say, a few years ago, that he could coach the Broncos as long as he wished. He had three years left on a contract that was to pay him about $20 million, The Associated Press reported. Last spring, Shanahan and his wife, Peggy, sold their suburban mansion for $16 million, according to The Rocky Mountain News, and began building a 35,000-square-foot home. Then the Broncos became the first team since divisional play began in 1967 to blow a three-game lead with three games remaining. On Sunday, with the American Football Conference West division title at stake, the Broncos lost to the San Diego Chargers, 52-21, to finish 8-8. They missed the playoffs for the third year in a row, the franchise’s longest drought since 1980-82. “After giving this careful consideration, I have concluded that a change in our football operations is in the best interests of the Denver Broncos,” Bowlen said in a statement. “This is certainly a difficult decision, but one that I feel must be made and which will ultimately be in the best interests of all concerned.” Shanahan spent 21 seasons in Denver, initially as a quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator under Dan Reeves, who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in the 1980s — all defeats. After a 20-game stint coaching the Raiders (Al Davis fired Shanahan four games into the 1989 season, and the two have feuded since over money that Shanahan says he is still owed) and two more seasons as a Broncos assistant, Shanahan became the offensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers. Working under Coach George Seifert and tutoring quarterback Steve Young, Shanahan helped the high-octane 49ers to a championship in 1994. Bowlen brought Shanahan back to Denver as the coach in 1995, as Elway’s career was winding down and his legacy seemed saddled by those three Super Bowl losses. The Broncos went 13-3 in 1996, losing to Tom Coughlin’s Jacksonville Jaguars in a playoff upset. But the Broncos went 12-4 and 14-2 the next two seasons, capped by Super Bowl victories that bestowed heroic status on Shanahan and Elway in the Mountain Time Zone. Shanahan could not find another quarterback to mold into a champion. He invested four seasons with Brian Griese, four with Jake Plummer and the past two with Jay Cutler. Although Cutler gave the Broncos hope for the future, Shanahan was ultimately undone by an increasingly leaky defense, something a revolving door of defensive coordinators could not seal, and a string of questionable draft picks and free-agent signings that Shanahan made as the team’s executive vice president for football operations. In Shanahan’s absence, the Broncos are in the market for a general manager as well. The Broncos’ defense was ranked among the league’s top seven in seven of the nine seasons beginning in 1997. In the last four years, however, the defense plunged to middle-of-the-pack status, then to No. 29 in 2008.In 16 seasons as an N.F.L. head coach, Shanahan compiled a 146-98 record. His teams were 8-5 in the playoffs, but 1-4 in the decade since Elway retired after Super Bowl XXXIII.",

    "source": "P.C. Richard Takes On the New Jersey Turnpike <eos> CARTERET, N.J. — Turning old industrial land into a sprightly new retail area is rarely easy, even in the best of times, but the task can seem especially daunting when the land in question sits next to a highway that is not a natural retail draw to begin with. Unlike certain highways in the state, the 148-mile New Jersey Turnpike, with widely dispersed interchanges and a paucity of retail sites, has long held more appeal for distribution companies and truckers than for shoppers. Still, that is not stopping one longstanding New York area retailer, P. C. Richard & Son of Farmingdale, N.Y., from pursuing a 15-acre development project that fronts the turnpike in this still heavily industrialized borough. The company, a regional seller of consumer electronics and appliances, is banking on the project to help it expand to the west and north of New York City and Long Island and improve its distribution operations. While few electronics retailers across the country are expanding and Circuit City is shuttering all of its 567 stores nationally, P. C. Richard, which in 2008 had sales of $1.5 billion, is still increasing its store numbers and its reach. It opened a store last fall, for instance, in Nanuet, N.Y., giving the company its first outlet in Rockland County. Founded by the Dutch immigrant Peter Christiaan Richard, who opened a hardware store in Brooklyn in 1909, the company now has 51 stores in New York and New Jersey. Until recently, P. C. Richard operated both a one-million-square-foot warehouse in Farmingdale and a 158,000-square-foot distribution center in Whippany, N.J., which it had leased for 10 years. Served by 50 to 75 trucks a day, the Whippany center was also home to a large employee training center. In early January, the company moved its Whippany distribution and employee training operations to a renovated 300,000-square-foot warehouse in Carteret that was once used by the Herman’s sporting goods chain, now defunct, and then by a variety of shorter-term tenants. It sits on a development site in western Carteret that directly fronts the turnpike at Exit 12. This is in a rundown section of the borough, but it has been tagged for retail redevelopment, partly because it is connected by Roosevelt Avenue, one of the borough’s main thoroughfares, with heavily trafficked Route 1, one of the busiest retail corridors in the state. Last year, P. C. Richard signed a four-year lease for the warehouse, with a commitment to buy it, at a price it would not disclose. Elsewhere on the site, the company bought a 64,370-square-foot building, which is still occupied by an automotive parts company, but which is to be remade within a year into a large P. C. Richard store and clearance center. The company already has a 55,000-square-foot center in Deer Park, N.Y. “We think our new facility puts us in an enviable position for our next round of growth in the state,” said Gregg Richard, the president of the company, which is now run by fourth-generation family members. Mr. Richard said the larger distribution center in Carteret would enable the company to more efficiently serve customers who now live as far west as Pennsylvania, as well as the growing number of buyers who ask the company to both deliver and install products like flat-screen television sets. He said P. C. Richard offered next-day delivery seven days a week on any product in stock. Thomas R. Carragher, branch manager for the northern New Jersey office at Studley, a real estate firm that specializes in representing tenants, said that P. C. Richard first began looking for a larger New Jersey warehouse and training facility about five years ago, and that the search eventually extended to some half-dozen counties. “We wanted to find the needle in the haystack — a modern distribution building that would give them highway signage, retail potential, and that could also be purchased,” said Gregg K. Najarian, a Studley managing director who worked with Mr. Carragher to find the site in Carteret, which is in Middlesex County. Still, borough officials, as well as some local real estate owners, are clearly hoping that P. C. Richard will eventually help to put Carteret on the retail map. One factor that is expected to improve Carteret’s prospects for attracting a broader business base is an overhaul now under way at Exit 12, where ramps, toll gates and toll lanes are being redesigned to alleviate truck traffic on local streets like Roosevelt Avenue and allow for easier turnpike access. Until recently, the interchange was a chronic source of congestion for motorists and for the many distribution companies, even though they generally liked Carteret’s proximity to New York and to the New Jersey port area and Newark Liberty International Airport . The exit overhaul is still only about two-thirds finished, but Frank V. Caccavo Jr., an executive vice president for Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey, said it had already led to a positive change in how distribution and warehouse companies look at the borough. William Sitar Jr., a vice president at the Sitar Company, a real estate services company in Iselin, noted that it was already easier for motorists to get to some of the retail businesses in the eastern part of the borough. Like many towns in New Jersey, Carteret’s fortunes were once closely tied to the chemical industry, with companies including DuPont, Mobil and Agrico, and more recently to warehouse and distribution companies. While the borough still has sizable brownfields, it now also has 17 areas, including some former polluted sites, that have been designated for development. Some of the borough’s old industrial pockets have already gone to new residential development, like the 288-unit Bristol Station, a gated luxury apartment project that opened in 2007 in an area near the waterfront. But so far retailers have been slow in moving to the 4.4-mile-square borough, even though its population is growing, unlike many towns in New Jersey. One problem is location: Sitting opposite Staten Island on the Arthur Kill Waterway, with the Rahway River to its north, the almost peninsula-shaped borough is often bypassed for nearby towns like Woodbridge and Linden, which are easier to reach. “P. C. Richard is one of the most dynamic retailers here so far,” said Kathaleen R. Shaw, the borough’s director of economic development.",

    "source": "Redskins Try to Dazzle Without Putting on a Show <eos> RICHMOND, Va. — Chris Thompson saw his friend and former teammate Robert Griffin III at the airport before camp. They chatted and went their separate ways. Their early October meeting was still a long way away. With Griffin now in Cleveland and the Redskins’ starting quarterback job firmly in the hands of Kirk Cousins, the Washington Redskins’ training camp has lacked the buzz and the drama of past years. At this year’s camp, the only remnants of Griffin’s tumultuous tenure with the team are the No. 10 jerseys worn by a few fans. Welcome to Camp Boring — which was exactly what Coach Jay Gruden wanted. “Well, we don’t want a three-ring circus out here,” Gruden said Tuesday. “I don’t know if it’s been like that in the past, probably when I first got here, but our goal is to coach football and play football. “We’re trying to get the best out of our guys. We’re not trying to do any crazy stunts off the field. We just want to focus in on our job at hand, and that’s to get better every day.” The sense of calm around the Redskins was unusual for an organization that has had a chaotic recent past. The team made an off-season splash by signing the All-Pro cornerback Josh Norman. He has been notable in camp so far by going up against the star receiver DeSean Jackson during drills and kicking a soccer ball around afterward to build camaraderie with his teammates. The biggest question regards receiver Josh Doctson, the first-round pick with the nagging Achilles’ tendon injury. He has been wearing a walking boot on his left foot. General Manager Scot McCloughan has been walking around with his left hand wrapped, reportedly the result of hitting something in anger after learning that Doctson was expected to remain out for weeks. “We’re trying to work him hard one day and then let him rest the next day, and keeping him in the boot is the best option we feel like right now,” Gruden said. Doctson has no time frame for joining practice, let alone being ready for games. But if that is the biggest cause of consternation around the Redskins, they will take it. “There’s no drama; there’s no distractions,” said Thompson, the Redskins’ second-string running back. “It’s just come to work and get better,” he added. “It’s boring in a good way. We’re just all here to work, and that’s just the goal. That’s what we’ve been wanting to do for the longest — just get all the drama out and play football. Now we’re able to do that.” Smaller crowds than previous years will not make Richmond officials happy, but there have been plenty of fans during workouts. Veterans who have been through plenty of camps brushed off the idea of boredom but conceded that this was not like any other year. They were not being asked about Griffin, the team’s nickname or any other issues. “It is good because you don’t have the frenzy of the reporters, and what we’re talking about is football and talking about football can only make you better, especially when you’ve got the right guys in the locker room,” said defensive lineman Kedric Golston, who is entering his 11th season with Washington. “We don’t have to talk about it or waste an ounce of energy on things that’s not going to help us win.” Coming off an improbable N.F.C. East title, the Redskins say that having Cousins as their quarterback, Matt Jones as their featured running back and Norman as their No. 1 cornerback will bolster their record. The signings of tight end Vernon Davis and safety David Bruton Jr., who both won the Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos, have added to the depth and have provided competition in camp. The fiercest competition might be Bruton vs. Duke Ihenacho for the starting strong safety job. Perry Riley vs. Mason Foster at inside linebacker and Spencer Long vs. Shawn Lauvao at left guard also bear watching. Told that his camp was calm and almost boring, Gruden laughed and said, “Thanks.” He would like to keep it that way. “We have a long ways to go, but all the off-the-field stuff and the entertainment value that people are looking for, hopefully they don’t find it here,” Gruden said, adding, “We’re very businesslike in our approach, and we’re trying to rebound from last year’s loss to the Packers and repeat as N.F.C. East champions and go a little bit further.”",

    "source": "Schwarzenegger, Brown and Whitman Finally Share a Stage <eos> LONG BEACH, Calif. — With less than a week until Election Day, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California has become a chunk of kryptonite that the candidates to succeed him lob at each other. But even as the candidates, Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown, scrambled to distance themselves from the governor, they shared a stage with him on Tuesday for the first time this election cycle. The event was a panel discussion, titled “Who We Are, Where Are We Going” and moderated by Matt Lauer of NBC’s “Today” show, that was the centerpiece of an annual women’s conference organized by Maria Shriver, Mr. Schwarzenegger’s wife. The governor entered to a swell of music after a short video that extolled his time in office. Ms. Whitman — who, like Mr. Schwarzenegger, is a Republican — and Mr. Brown, the Democratic nominee, followed. After perfunctory handshakes, they flanked Mr. Schwarzenegger around a small table. Mr. Schwarzenegger has not endorsed either candidate, but his image has loomed large in recent days. The Brown campaign introduced an advertisement featuring sound bites from Mr. Schwarzenegger spliced with clips of Ms. Whitman making nearly identical remarks. In response, Ms. Whitman said Mr. Brown’s tax strategies and environmental ideas augured more of what the Schwarzenegger administration had been dishing up. The conference program also included speeches by Michelle Obama and Laura Bush, as well as talks about “work-life balance” and weight loss. When Mr. Lauer pressed the candidates to “pull all negative ads and replace them with positive ads” in the remaining days of the race, Mr. Schwarzenegger sat back as Mr. Brown pledged to comply and Ms. Whitman smiled at the cheering audience. “I will say,” Ms. Whitman said after a pause, “the things I have been called in this campaign, it’s not fair to the voters of California.” Mr. Lauer asked for a handshake, a verbal pledge, any clear agreement to his challenge before time ran out on the panel. Mr. Schwarzenegger leaned forward and assumed the role of referee. “Maybe it’s hard to come to an agreement now, in front of an audience,” he said. “I can already see the political spin masters in the back saying, ‘Why did you do that?’ ” The three then stood for a photograph, posing with hands stiffly at their sides for several seconds, to a soundtrack of frantic drumming. Mr. Schwarzenegger reached up and gripped Mr. Brown’s and Ms. Whitman’s shoulders, pulling their heads close to his big grin.",

The allegations “grossly distort and mischaracterize” the company’s revenue cycle services, it said in a statement. The suggestion that Accretive puts bedside pressure on patients to pay their bills out of pocket is a “flagrant distortion of fact,” the company said. It said it was working with its advisers to address those allegations. Accretive shares plunged nearly 42 percent on Wednesday after Attorney General Lori Swanson of Minnesota issued a report contending that Accretive violated federal and state patient-privacy and debt-collection laws. She said that in some cases patients at Fairview Health Services, a Minnesota hospital chain, were pressured for payment before they received care and that Accretive’s debt collectors did not properly disclose their role. Accretive said in its statement that it did not deny access to patient care and that the allegations were “flatly untrue.” Ms. Swanson said last week that employees at Fairview, a nonprofit chain of seven hospitals based in Minneapolis, were required to use a system to track whether patients paid their bills.

    "source": "Tibet Self-Immolations Moves to Lhasa <eos> BEIJING — One man died and another was seriously injured when they set themselves on fire outside Tibetan Buddhism’s holiest temple in the center of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency. It was the first time that such protests against Chinese rule have occurred in the city. The self-immolations occurred on Sunday afternoon outside the Jokhang Temple during the holy month of Saga Dawa, when followers of Tibetan Buddhism celebrate the birth, enlightenment and death of Buddha. They were the most significant act of protest in Lhasa since an uprising in 2008 that was crushed by Chinese security forces. The authorities stepped up security in Lhasa after the uprising, particularly in the central market area known as the Barkhor. The Jokhang Temple, which is a pilgrimage destination, is in the heart of the area. That two men set themselves on fire in Lhasa, far from the sites of earlier self-immolations in eastern Tibet and under tight security since 2008, underscores the widening discontent over Chinese rule. At least 36 people in the Tibetan regions of China have set themselves on fire since March 2011, when a monk named Phuntsog from the Kirti Monastery set himself on fire in Ngaba, a town in a Tibetan area of Sichuan Province. Xinhua identified the two protesters on Sunday as Dargye, from Aba County, the Chinese name for Ngaba, and Tobgye Tseten, from Xiahe County, or Labrang in Tibetan, the seat of the famous Labrang Monastery and a center of protests against Chinese rule. Both counties are in the region of eastern Tibet that is traditionally known as Amdo and where the worlds of the ethnic Tibetans and ethnic Hans have overlapped. The Han rule China, and many Tibetans resent Beijing’s policies in Tibet and the Han who migrate into Tibetan regions for work and business opportunities. Tobgye Tseten died in the fire he set, Xinhua said, but Dargye survived. He was seriously injured, the news agency said, but was in stable condition and able to talk. Harriet Beaumont, a spokeswoman for the advocacy group Free Tibet, identified the man who died as Dorjee Tseten, 19, from Bhora in Labrang County. She said the two men shouted three times outside the temple before setting themselves on fire, but it was not immediately clear what they said. Afterward, she said, security officers began detaining Tibetans, especially those from Ngaba County. A man who answered the telephone at the Yarlung Tsangpo Hotel in Lhasa said security in the city had been tightened and additional security forces sent in. The man, who gave his name as Mr. Liu, said it was unclear whether the new forces were made up of regular police officers or were units of the People’s Armed Police, a paramilitary force that is usually called out to quell riots and maintain security in the restive ethnic regions of western China. Robert J. Barnett, a scholar of modern Tibet at Columbia University, said a Tibetan in Lhasa had told him the city was in a “boiling situation” after the self-immolations. “We’re now seeing self-immolations that seem to be political expressions that are in sympathy with the core incidents that happened earlier,” Mr. Barnett said. “The Chinese officials are really worried,” he said, because the latest protests seem to be “driven by an idea, a political goal.” By contrast, he said, the earlier self-immolations in Ngaba were largely in reaction to security clampdowns at the Kirti Monastery after the 2008 uprising. Ngaba has been the center of the self-immolations, but Tibetans have now set themselves on fire in areas across the vast Tibetan plateau. Most have been members of the clergy. Before the self-immolations in Lhasa, there had been just one such protest in the Tibet Autonomous Region, by a layman in the eastern area known as Chamdo. The self-immolations on Sunday were first reported by Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, which have contact with Tibetans in western China. Voice of America reported that the two men worked at a restaurant in Lhasa called Nyima Ling. Radio Free Asia said the two were monks who were taken away in security vehicles within 15 minutes of setting themselves on fire. In March, President Hu Jintao of China told the Tibet delegates to the National People’s Congress in Beijing that they must exert a “continuous effort in sustaining social harmony and stability.” Official news reports say Chen Quanguo, the current party chief of Tibet, repeated Mr. Hu’s words in public meetings and said officials would “persist in the thought that stability overrides all.”",

    "source": "Vatican Priest Likens Criticism Over Abuse to Anti-Semitism <eos> ROME — A senior Vatican priest, speaking before Pope Benedict XVI at a Good Friday service, compared the world’s outrage at sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church to the persecution of the Jews, prompting angry responses from victims’ advocates and consternation from Jewish groups. The Vatican spokesman quickly distanced the Vatican from the remarks, which came on the day Christians mark the Crucifixion. They underscored how much the Catholic Church has felt under attack from recent news reports and from criticism over how it has handled charges of child molesting against priests in the past. The pope and his bishops have denounced abuses in the church, but many prelates and Vatican officials have lashed back at news reports that Benedict failed to act strongly enough against pedophile priests, once as archbishop of Munich and Freising in 1980 and once as a leader of the Vatican’s powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The Vatican has denied that he was at fault, and Vatican officials have variously described the reports as “deceitful,” an effort to undermine the church and a “defamatory campaign.” Speaking in St. Peter’s Basilica, the priest, the Rev. Raniero Cantalamessa, took note that Easter and Passover fell during the same week this year, and said he was led to think of the Jews. “They know from experience what it means to be victims of collective violence, and also because of this they are quick to recognize the recurring symptoms,” said Father Cantalamessa, who serves under the title of preacher of the papal household. Then he quoted from what he said was a letter from a Jewish friend he did not identify. “I am following the violent and concentric attacks against the church, the pope and all the faithful by the whole world,” he said the friend wrote. “The use of stereotypes, the passing from personal responsibility and guilt to a collective guilt, remind me of the more shameful aspects of anti-Semitism.” Good Friday has traditionally been a fraught day in Catholic-Jewish relations. Until the liberalizing Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, Catholic liturgy included a prayer for the conversion of the Jews, and Catholic teaching held Jews responsible for the Crucifixion. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, stressed that Father Cantalamessa’s sermon represented his own thoughts and was not an official Vatican statement. Father Lombardi said the remarks should not be construed as equating recent criticism of the Catholic Church with anti-Semitism. “I don’t think it’s an appropriate comparison,” he said. “That’s why the letter should be read as a letter of solidarity by a Jew.” Yet the official Vatican newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano, published the remarks in its Saturday edition, which appeared online on Friday evening. Even as the priest spoke out against attacks on the church, Archbishop Robert Zollitsch of Freiburg, head of the German Bishops Conference, said Friday that sexual abuse victims were not helped enough “out of a misplaced concern for the reputation of the church.” The church, he said, was shaken by “the suffering inflicted on the victims, who often for decades could not put their injuries into words.” Bishops around Europe have been offering similar remarks in recent days, following a major statement by the pope on molesting in the Irish church. Father Cantalamessa’s comments about the Jews came toward the end of a long talk about Scripture, the nature of violence and the sacrifice of Jesus. He also spoke at length about violence against women, but gave only slight mention of the children and adolescents who had been molested by priests. “I am not speaking here of violence against children, of which unfortunately also elements of the clergy are stained; of that there is sufficient talk outside of here,” he said. Disclosures about hundreds of such cases have emerged in recent months in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and France, after a previous round of scandal in the United States. A leading advocate for sexual abuse victims in the United States, David Clohessy, called comparing criticism of the church to persecution of the Jews “breathtakingly callous and misguided.” “Men who deliberately and consistently hide child sex crime are in no way victims,” he said. “And to conflate public scrutiny with horrific violence is about as wrong as wrong can be.” Another American victims’ advocate rejected the Vatican’s statement distancing itself from the remarks. “Father Cantalamessa chose to equate calumny against the Jewish people as the same as criticism of Pope Benedict,” said Kristine Ward, a spokeswoman for the National Survivor Advocates Coalition. “It is incomprehensible that Father Cantalamessa did this and that Pope Benedict, the ultimate authority in this church who presided at the service, did not stand during the service to disavow this connection to anti-Semitism.” The comments also ruffled Vatican-Jewish relations, which have often been tense during Benedict’s papacy. Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni, the chief rabbi of Rome, who was host to Benedict at the Rome synagogue in January on a visit that helped calm waters after a year of tensions, laughed in seeming disbelief when asked about Father Cantalamessa’s remarks. “With a minimum of irony, I will say that today is Good Friday, when they pray that the Lord illuminate our hearts so we recognize Jesus,” Rabbi Di Segni said, referring to a prayer in the traditional Catholic liturgy calling for the conversion of the Jews. “We also pray that the Lord illuminate theirs.” Abraham Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League in the United States, attributed the remarks to ignorance, not malice. “You would think that a senior priest in the church would have a better understanding of anti-Semitism than to make this hideous comparison,” he said. Benedict caused friction with Jewish groups in 2007 when he issued a ruling making it easier to use the Latin Mass , including that Good Friday prayer. In January 2009, he stirred outrage when he revoked the excommunication of four schismatic bishops, one of whom turned out to have denied the scope of the Holocaust. Father Cantalamessa’s remarks come after weeks of intense scrutiny of Benedict, which some in the Italian news media have seen in conspiratorial terms. Last week, the center-left daily newspaper La Repubblica wrote , without attribution, that “certain Catholic circles” believed the criticism of the church stemmed from “a New York ‘Jewish lobby.” Father Cantalamessa is a longtime fixture in the papal household, having been appointed its official preacher by Pope John Paul II in 1980. The apostolic preacher, as he also is called, gives meditations — especially during Advent and Lent — for the pope and Vatican hierarchy. The role was established by Pope Paul IV in the middle of the 16th century, and the job was later reserved for a member of the Franciscan Order of Capuchin Friars Minor. Father Cantalamessa was also tasked to deliver a meditation on the problems facing the church and need for careful consideration to the college of cardinals shortly after the death of John Paul II, as they prepared to elect his successor. Their choice was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict.",

    "source": "Advocate Faults I.R.S. on Collecting Delinquent Taxes <eos> The Internal Revenue Service ’s collection of delinquent taxes from 2005 to 2007 was substantially less than initially reported, an agency watchdog said Wednesday. The I.R.S. collected only about $86 billion in delinquent taxes over the 2005-7 fiscal years — about 27 percent less than the $118 billion it originally reported as having taken in, the Taxpayer Advocate Service, the oversight arm of the I.R.S., said Wednesday in its annual report . “There is an astonishing lack of transparency as to what is included in these revenue figures and how they are computed,” wrote Nina E. Olson, the report’s author and the national taxpayer advocate. She added that “a thorough assessment of the effectiveness of I.R.S. collection practices” was “impossible.” The report, which is required by law, criticized the I.R.S. for burying the lower figure in a footnote and for not explaining how either number was calculated. In addition to the collection information, the report singled out poor customer service at the agency, saying that the single biggest problem at the agency was getting an I.R.S. representative to pick up the phone when a taxpayer called with questions. Only six out of 10 callers now get through, after an average waiting time of 12 minutes, compared with eight out of 10 three years ago. The report called the I.R.S.’s customer service — a focus of the agency — “unacceptable.” In a response to the report, the I.R.S. said that the “resources available to deliver telephone services are finite and staffing allocations must be made in light of competing demands necessary to meet other customer needs and preferences.” The report criticized the I.R.S. for what it called its excessive use of liens, which are claims levied on property or income to secure a taxpayer’s unpaid tax bills. The liens, it said, which are processed by computer, not by people, are increasingly filed against taxpayers with little or no property. In its response, the I.R.S. said that claims filed against property or future income increased the odds that taxpayers would eventually pay their overdue tax bills. The report also criticized an I.R.S. initiative that would increase monitoring of tax preparers, a largely unregulated industry used by many of America’s more than 131 million tax filers. The rules do not cover so-called back-room tax preparers — the majority of actual preparers — who fill in the returns and then hand them to a superior for signature.",

    "source": "Target Steps Out in Front of Bathroom Choice Debate <eos> A new policy over bathroom choice has thrust the retailer Target into the center of a nationwide debate over gender identity, civil rights and privacy. Last week, Target announced on its website that it would allow transgender employees and customers to choose the restroom and fitting room that corresponded with their gender identities. About a month earlier, North Carolina passed a law restricting bathroom access to transgender people, a bill that set off a national debate that has even extended to the presidential campaign. The company’s announcement — the most prominent position taken by a national retailer — was greeted by cheers from supporters of transgender rights. It has since also made Target the intense focus of conservative activists, lawmakers and consumers, who oppose the company’s stance, highlighting the potential risks when a company takes a position on a hotly debated social issue. Some groups have used Target’s announcement as a rallying cry, arguing that Target’s policy threatens the public’s safety. An online petition started by one group, the American Family Association, calling for a boycott of Target stores, has been signed by more than 900,000 people. On Tuesday, the City Council in Oxford, Ala., passed an ordinance forbidding people to use a bathroom that does not match the gender assigned to them at birth. Target has a store in the city. “I will no longer be shopping at your store and neither will any of my family members and friends,” one person commented on Target’s Facebook page. “You have all lost your minds.” Equipped with a growing arsenal of digital tools to organize boycotts, spread poor reviews and otherwise negatively impact sales, consumers are increasingly putting pressure on companies to address their concerns. Policies on gender and sexuality have repeatedly become points of contention, putting some businesses on the front lines of battles over social issues. Last year, for example, a number of companies vocally opposed so-called religious freedom laws intended to give businesses legal cover to deny services to gays and lesbians. Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, was among the most prominent voices, and its influence was widely credited with pushing the governor in its home state of Arkansas to sign an amended version of the state’s religious freedom bill. And the head of Chick-fil-A, the restaurant chain, took a position against gay marriage in 2012 only to back off two years later and say that he had not meant to alienate customers. “Generally speaking, as you saw in the gay marriage debate, the big corporations tend to be out in front of Congress and most of the states in implementing anti-discrimination policies,” said William Eskridge, a professor at Yale Law School and a co-author of “Sexuality, Gender and the Law.” “The policies generally do not cost the corporations anything or very much, and they create some degree of good will,” he said. The ordinance in Oxford would make it a misdemeanor for people to use bathrooms that do not correspond to the gender on their birth certificates. Target’s liability in such a situation is unclear. A company spokeswoman, Molly Snyder, said Target would comply with all local laws. But she also said, “Our belief in and commitment to inclusivity has not changed.” Ms. Snyder said the company’s policy had applied to employees for years, though it had not been as widely distributed. She referred to the original announcement, which said that Target “regularly” assesses issues that could affect business, guests and employees, and “given the specific questions” raised by recent legislative proposals, “we felt it was important to state our position.” Target may be betting on a more progressive shift in national attitudes on gender and sexuality. Many states have updated their statutes barring employers from discriminating based on sexual identity to include gender identity, too. “Making these progressive value statements is a new form of advertising,” said Jonah Berger, an associate professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. There may also be more practical benefits than just netting good will: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws, has made it clear that blocking workers from using bathrooms that correspond to their gender identities violates federal law . “Any employer that has a rule to the contrary is going to find itself in very hot water,” said Jillian T. Weiss, a professor of law and society at Ramapo College who has worked on a number of cases involving transgender workplace issues. “Companies have got to be aware that federal law essentially prohibits them from having rules like the one passed in Alabama.” Other companies, including Barnes & Noble and Hudson’s Bay Company, also have policies explicitly allowing transgender people to use a bathroom that does not correspond to their birth certificate gender. “We’re hoping that other corporations will see that there is a price to pay, potentially at least, for pushing this L.G.B.T. agenda too far,” said Tim Wildmon, the president of the American Family Association. “We just think this is a bridge too far.”",

    "source": "Germany and Greece Locked in a Mutual Obsession <eos> BERLIN — Lest Greeks forget, the Germans are watching. Closely. When the leftist Syriza-led government was elected in Greece on Jan. 25, public broadcasters broke into Germany’s favorite crime series to announce the result. Television stations went live to Athens several times that night. Years of crisis over Greece’s finances have often pitted Europe’s weakest economy against Europe’s economic powerhouse. German admiration for ancient Greece — dating back at least to Goethe — has given way to hard-nosed pragmatism, even in the face of increasing hardship in Greece. Having contributed the largest share of the 240 billion euros, or $255 billion, of credits extended to Athens, Germany believes that it has done the most to keep Greece solvent and in the eurozone. And Germans keep tabs on their money. Journalists and politicians here fret daily about Athens’ willingness to keep agreements with international creditors, or, by accident or design, leaving the eurozone. Complex graphs on Greek debt are a staple of newscasts that veer from patronizing to panicky. Less seriously, they ponder whether Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, 40, will ever wear a tie. For weeks, the countries’ finance ministers sparred almost daily. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Mr. Tsipras called a halt when the Greek leader came to Berlin and was received with full honors. But tempers were not assuaged for long. As Mr. Tsipras headed to Moscow last week, his deputy finance minister declared that Germany owed Greece €287 billion in reparations for the Nazi occupation in World War II. That argument over compensation for tens or hundreds of thousands of deaths, and repayment of a forced loan, has endured for decades. Ms. Merkel’s government insists that the matter is closed, while recognizing continued “moral responsibility” for war crimes. Some opposition figures in Germany are open to new payments to Greece. But the latest demand tested even Ms. Merkel’s vice chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the center-left Social Democrats. “Honestly, I find it stupid,” Mr. Gabriel said. “The Greeks have an interest in opening up space for a changed policy. That has nothing at all to do with World War II, or reparations.” Predictably, in the Greek echo chamber, Mr. Gabriel was presented as branding all Greeks as “dumb.” German politicians, meanwhile, backed by a Brussels chorus, worried that Greece would break ranks on sanctions against Russia over Ukraine. The visit to Moscow was “a threatening gesture,” thundered Elmar Brok, a Merkel party ally and veteran of European politics. Martin Schulz, the German who heads the European Parliament, warned Greece not to seek “solidarity” in Moscow and to remember which government (Europe, Germany) had shown the most “solidarity” to date. Hundreds of thousands of Germans and Greeks living in each other’s country feel squeezed. Jens Bastian, a German economist in Greece for 16 years, was on morning television in Germany last week, pleading for calm. “I am often surprised and frustrated” by the German news media, he said by telephone afterward. “Tone it down,” he said. “Don’t get hysterical.” Meanwhile, he says, the Greek news media seizes on almost any utterance about Greece for at least 10 minutes of any evening’s hourlong newscasts. That attitude compounds what he calls two mistakes of the Greek government. First, it won a mandate not for change in Europe, but for “a change — or at least attempting one — in Greece.” Second, “you cannot take a confrontational approach to Germany,” a main creditor and trade and political partner. “You need to have Germany on side, not off.” Pigi Mourmouri, 67, a retired social worker from Greece who has lived in Berlin for over 40 years, resents some of what she sees here. “I have felt bad, because I had to justify myself,” she said. “And that is not a good feeling.” Besides, the “arrogance and superiority” of some German news outlets is hard to miss. Instead of advancing European unity, as the euro was supposed to do, she said, people are thrown back on themselves. “You feel it in small ways,” she said, citing a carnival two years ago. The host welcomed her and a friend warmly but ignored them once he realized that they were Greek. From both Germany and Greece, she said, “I try to take the best. That is a luxury I still have.”",

    "source": "The Mets’ Bat Whisperer <eos> PITTSBURGH — Whenever he receives a new box of bats, Carlos Beltran takes each bat out, holds it to his ear and raps it, gently but convincingly, with the base of his hand, his head cocked, one eye shut, concentrating like a virtuoso tuning his violin. Mark Fidrych was once considered an eccentric for talking to baseballs. Carlos Beltran listens to his bats. “I’ve been doing this since my second year in the big leagues,” he said. “It’s part of me, part of feeling comfortable. As a player, you know what is best for you. This doesn’t make me the hitter I am, but maybe it gives me a little edge.” Hitting a baseball is first and foremost about seeing a pitch, but for Beltran, it’s about hearing a pitch, too: the sound a bat makes when struck with his hand. When Beltran hears the right pitch vibrate from a 32-ounce piece of lumber, it produces a tone that for him is as sweet as music. Ever since he was taught by one of the great hitters in the game to appreciate the melody that each bat inherently produces, Beltran has followed the practice religiously. The higher the pitch tone, the harder and more dense the wood, Beltran said. The harder the wood, the farther the ball is expected to travel. “The higher the pitch, the better,” he said, referring to the tone. “Better means stronger and harder, more compressed.” Beltran, who leads the Mets in home runs with 9 and runs batted in with 37, and is tied for the lead in the National League with 20 doubles, learned the auditory technique from Edgar Martinez, the Seattle Mariners designated hitter, who used his high-pitched bats to rap 2,247 career hits. In Beltran’s second full year with the Kansas City Royals in 2000, he was chatting with Martinez at the batting cage at Safeco Field about their bats. Beltran was using a Louisville Slugger C243 at the time, and Martinez had an M356, which is similar but has a thinner handle. Known for meticulously weighing each bat, Martinez asked Beltran how much his weighed, and Beltran said they were usually 31.5 to 32 ounces. Martinez took one, held it close to his ear and banged it with his hand as he listened. Beltran was immediately curious. “I said, ‘What are you doing?’ ” Beltran recalled. “He said, ‘I just like to hear the pitch of the sound of the bat.’ I said, ‘For what reason?’ And he said, ‘The higher the pitch, the better the wood.’ ” For Beltran, those became words to hit by. When Beltran sifts through a box of new bats, he places them into three categories: best, medium and batting practice. He said that in a typical box of a dozen new Marucci maple bats — model CB15 — his preferred brand the past five years, he might find five or six with a high enough pitch to use in a game. Then he labels each one in tiny print with a pen on the handle butt. “I separate them in three classes,” he said. “Good, so-so and batting practice. I put BP on those, and on the other ones I put 1 and 2. A 1 means it’s the best. Sometimes, when I run out of bats, I might take a 2 for a game. Nobody has really asked me about it, so I haven’t really shared it with anyone. It’s just something I do myself. I don’t even think about it. I just get my bats and listen to them and separate them.” Jack Marucci, the founder and president of the company bearing his name, called Beltran a master technician, and said his listening technique reflected more scientific density measurements his company did on its wood, from trees grown in central Pennsylvania and shipped to the factory in Louisiana. But Marucci, not wanting to tip off the competition, would not reveal what those measurements entail. Like Martinez before him, Beltran also carefully weighs his bats, using a digital scale in the Mets’ clubhouse, and will keep track of even one-tenth of an ounce difference. On days when he is feeling tired and is about to face a closer throwing 98 miles per hour, he might drop down in weight from 31.5 ounces to 31.1. Or, if he is feeling strong, he might leave behind the 32-ouncer and upgrade to 32.2. “I try to make sure that I know my weights, because every day you feel different,” he said. Some players are oblivious to the method of listening to the bats’ vibrations, but others are at least familiar with it. That includes Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, who has used the same model and size bat since he was 18. He said that he was aware that some players listened to their bats, but that he didn’t practice it himself. “I wouldn’t even know what to listen for,” Jeter said. Every player listens to the sound the ball makes when it makes contact with a bat. Beltran says the dulcet tones he hears when he tests the bat with his hands often reflect the sound he hears when the bat cracks the ball in play, and the results. “The sound off a good bat is different than the sound of a bad bat,” he said. “I believe the ball will come out of the bat a little harder. No one has told me that, and I can’t prove it. But sometimes, I bring two bats to batting practice, a good one and the other ones, and for sure when you hit the ball, a good bat always has a better sound, a higher-pitch sound.” For most of a career in which he had pounded out 1,824 hits, 371 doubles and 289 home runs, that has been something to hear.",

    "source": "New Vaccine Shows Promise Against Mosquito-Borne Virus <eos> A new vaccine in its first human trials may offer protection against the chikungunya virus , a mosquito-borne infection that causes fever and severe joint pain, researchers reported Thursday in The Lancet . As of June 13, there were an estimated 166,000 suspected cases in the Caribbean and South America. Last month, the first cases in the United States were reported in Florida. The first phase of the trial — to test for safety and immune response — involved 25 participants and found no serious side effects. All participants developed antibodies that lasted at least six months after the last of three injections, suggesting the vaccine might provide long-term protection. “The exciting finding in this trial is both the fact the vaccine was so well tolerated and we measured impressive antibody levels in the recipients” that were similar to levels in people who had recently recovered from chikungunya, said Dr. Julie E. Ledgerwood , the senior author of the study and chief of the clinical trials program at the Vaccine Research Center, part of the National Institutes of Health. That similarity is important, she said, because “people who make a robust response after recovering appear to be protected from future infections.” The vaccine uses particles that contain the outer structural proteins of the virus, but because they don’t contain the virus’s genetic material, they cannot cause infection. The trial’s next phase will test for efficacy in a larger, more diverse group of participants. Predicting a disease’s spread can help nations plan, but it’s tricky. And it’s usually based on historical data. On Friday, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced a cash-prize challenge for a model that can most accurately predict the chikungunya virus’s spread in the Americas and the Caribbean over a six-month period starting in September. The aim is to interest meteorologists, entomologists and financial forecasters to work with new data sets to address this public-health need.",

    "source": "ConocoPhillips Earnings Set Record, but Lag Forecast <eos> ConocoPhillips posted its highest quarterly earnings ever on Wednesday as crude prices topped out above $140 a barrel, but it still lagged analyst expectations as expensive oil sapped results at its refining business. The oil company said that profit rose 13 percent from last year, excluding a $4.5 billion charge taken in the year-earlier quarter related to Venezuela’s takeover of Conoco’s operations there. Net income in the quarter rose to $5.44 billion, or $3.50 a share, from $301 million, or 18 cents a share, last year. Excluding the charge from Venezuela, ConocoPhillips earned about $4.81 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected the company to earn $3.53 a share in the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue in the quarter rose more than 50 percent, to $71.4 billion. Oil companies have been reporting record or near record earnings for the last several years as oil prices have surged nearly fivefold. Prices have moderated in the last two weeks, dropping back to around $125 a barrel. Shares of ConocoPhillips fell $2.48, or 2.9 percent, to $81.83 as lower oil prices weighed on the whole sector. Although oil prices in the United States in the second quarter were nearly double those of a year earlier, gasoline prices rose only 25 percent in the same period. That resulted in weak product margins for companies like ConocoPhillips that not only produce oil, but also refine it to make gasoline and other products. Production fell to the equivalent of 2.2 million barrels of oil a day, from 2.38 million barrels last year, mostly because of the loss of production in Venezuela. ConocoPhillips expects third-quarter production in line with second-quarter levels.",

    "source": "Clergy and New York Burger Co. Team to Fight Jinx <eos> The three holy men made their pilgrimages to Chelsea, braving snow and frigid winds, from as far away as New Jersey and the Bronx. But they had not come on Monday to tend to the sick or minister to the poor. They had come bearing the prayers and totems of their various faiths — Catholic, Jewish, Buddhist — to cleanse any lurking evil from that most hallowed of American institutions: a burger joint. There was to be a private Native American ceremony at some point; an Episcopalian minister, running late, would officiate later in the day. “This is the first time I blessed hamburger,” said the Rev. Ed Sombilon of Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church in Fort Lee, N.J. “But God works in mysterious ways, even crooked ways.” The operators of a new outpost of New York Burger Company, scheduled to open next week at 470 West 23rd Street, cooked up the ceremony along with their publicist in the hopes that the blessings — or at least the media attention they would draw — would help the restaurant succeed in a spot where so many had failed. The location, at the southeast corner of 23rd Street and 10th Avenue, is a place where restaurant dreams are made and dashed, sometimes within a single year. Four restaurants have come and gone from the corner in the last dozen years. “We believed that the location, the proximity of the High Line , all these things were great assets for our business,” said Jonathan Moldovan, a partner in the franchise along with his twin brothers, Petrous and Brice, and sister, Elisabeth Dufeu. “We figured we might as well get as much blessing as we could.” In most neighborhoods, there is at least one jinxed location where — despite ostensible ingredients for success like foot traffic, decent food and even a successful place next door — no one can seem to make a go of it. The dining blog Eater.com even published a list this year of 11 locations it deemed the most cursed, including the Chelsea corner, a spot at Fifth Avenue and President Street in Brooklyn that turned over four times in about three years, and a space on Avenue of the Americas in TriBeCa where three different restaurants operated in little more than a year and a half. “Sometimes it’s the landlord or the infrastructure in the building,” Robert W. Walsh , commissioner of the city’s Department of Small Business Services, said. “In some cases it’s the accessibility or ability to get there from primary routes.” Mr. Walsh, who directed the Union Square business improvement district, recalled that when Danny Meyer was looking to expand from Union Square Cafe , Mr. Meyer insisted on a place that his clientele, traveling from Midtown, could reach with a left turn from Fifth Avenue. In the case of 470 West 23rd Street, the reason for the failures is not entirely clear — even to its veterans. “Ahhhh,” cried Robert Arbor, who opened Le Solex there in 1998, after the spot had sat empty for five years. He was also the founder of the successful minichain of Le Gamin bistros. “It is the Bermuda Triangle, the evil nest, my downfall, my only failure,” he said. Mr. Arbor said his restaurant worked for a bit in the beginning and then just stopped. He said that the only downside to the space was that its enclosed sidewalk cafe made it “freezing in the winter but like a greenhouse in the summer,” but that it should have worked nonetheless. He eventually sold to Jerry Joseph of the successful Jerry’s restaurants, who could not make it work either. Outside the restaurant, residents did not have a unified theory on why the spot was so troubled. Eve S. Rosahn, 59, a public defender, said that although the location’s last restaurant, Il Bordello, had not appealed to her — “I wasn’t particularly looking for another Italian restaurant,” she said — she had liked Jerry’s and did not understand why it had closed. But since the new owners have replaced the old drafty windows, she said, “I’m probably going to eat way too many burgers now.” Whether the blessings — which included the installation of a mezuza in the doorway by Rabbi Dennis Tobin of Temple Beth-El in Co-op City and the sprinkling of water in four directions by the Rev. Robert Chodo Campbell, a Buddhist priest — can help remains to be seen. Edward Kirkland, chairman of the community board’s landmarks committee, who has fought to get the sidewalk cafe removed because he believes it does not fit in with the brownstones, said the burgers might prove a hit. “In the early days it was a little isolated and there weren’t many restaurants there,” he said, adding that as the waterfront area built up and become more fashionable, it was possible that the restaurant would be successful. But that, he said, “is a thing of this world rather than the next.”",

    "source": "U.C.L.A. Sends Notre Dame to Seventh Straight Loss, 89-63 <eos> LOS ANGELES (AP) — Early in the morning or late at night, the U.C.L.A. Bruins are mowing down opponents at any hour. Alfred Aboya scored 19 points and grabbed 7 rebounds Saturday in No. 15 U.C.L.A.’s 89-63 rout of Notre Dame . The Fighting Irish lost their seventh consecutive game for the first time since the 1992-93 season. It was the fourth straight blowout victory for the Bruins (19-4), who have won those games by an average of 22.7 points since an 86-75 loss at Washington on Jan. 24. Since then, they have outscored their opponents by a combined 58 points in the first half. “It’s obvious we’ve been performing at a new level and just improving as a team,” said U.C.L.A. Coach Ben Howland, who won his 145th game in his sixth season, tying him for fourth on the program’s career victory list. “It was a good statement for our team and our conference to play them like this.” Darren Collison added 17 points, and Nikola Dragovic and the freshman Jermine Anderson had 10 points each for U.C.L.A. The Bruins have forced 74 turnovers during their four-game winning streak, including 11 on Saturday. “It’s our intensity,” Collison said. “We raised the level a notch on the defensive end and guys started playing their role harder. When our intensity is at a high level, we’re hard to beat.” Tory Jackson scored 17 and Kyle McAlarney 16 for the Irish (12-10), who dropped to 2-7 against ranked opponents. This losing streak, their worst under Coach Mike Brey, matched the seven in a row Notre Dame lost to end the 1992-93 season. “We’re searching for a win,” Brey said. “We can’t feel sorry for ourselves. This is the biggest challenge in the history of the program, but I think our kids will respond.” Playing for the first time since 2005, the teams tipped off at 10 a.m. local time because of the national telecast. The Bruins sure did not look groggy. U.C.L.A.’s trapping defense shut down an Irish team that came in averaging 79.4 points. The Irish had just 30 at the break. Aboya and U.C.L.A.’s double teams forced the Fighting Irish star Luke Harangody into his worst performance of the season. He was held to 5 points and a rebound — all in the first half. It was the first time in 15 games Harangody did not lead the Irish in scoring. “I had a hard time getting it out of the post and made some mistakes early,” said Harangody, who played only seven minutes in the second half. “We didn’t fight at all. They threw a couple punches and we just seemed to back down.” Aboya saw the frustration in Harangody’s body language. “Every time he missed a shot he was upset with himself,” Aboya said. “The double team was really efficient. He had a good taste of it. He had an off day and I’m glad it was against me.” The Bruins took command from the opening tip, running out to leads of 14-2 and 20-7 while fans were still filling empty seats. Josh Shipp’s one-handed fast-break dunk off a lob from Collison and Dragovic’s stuff that sent Harangody sprawling to the floor highlighted the fast start. “They got off to such a great start,” Brey said. “We had some great looks early and you got to knock down a few more of those. We had some key turnovers that turned into easy baskets.”",

    "source": "Using Silly Cat Videos to Sell Litter-Box Products <eos> WATCHING cat videos is so popular that it has become shorthand for being unproductive, whether or not someone being distracted by the Internet is actually watching a cat riding a robotic vacuum or playing the piano. Now a cat product that was introduced in 2012, Litter Genie, is being featured in a series of promotional videos on YouTube. Introduced in March by Playtex, the division of Energizer Holdings that makes Diaper Genie, an odor-eliminating diaper pail, Litter Genie has a similar design, with a replaceable cartridge of plastic liners that are cinched closed to lock in odors. But Litter Genie is a receptacle for clumps of waste scooped from the litter box. A Litter Genie video that is to be introduced on Tuesday uses the form of a music video, complete with opening credits in the lower left corner that include the name of the song, “Me Luvz Mahselfz,” and the artist, Walter and the Lap Cats. In the video, set in what is meant to resemble a well-appointed bachelor pad and with music sung in a rhythm and blues style, cats wear gold chains and gem-studded collars. “We’re filling you with five layered bags,” sings a vocalist, “blocking odor so no one gags.” The video, by JWT New York, part of WPP, directed by Keith Schofield and produced by Caviar in Los Angeles, is the third in a series featuring cats for the brand. One introduced in September is in the style of psychedelic 1960s music (“I Haz a Catnip in Mah Head”) and has 1.3 million views on YouTube; another released a month later in the style of punk rock (“I Haz a Pie Row Tek Nik”) has more than 1.1 million views. Claire Capeci, global business director at JWT New York, said one challenge with making videos promoting the product was that its function is hardly glamorous. “At the end of the day, we’re talking about a disposal system for cat poop,” said Ms. Capeci. The cat music videos, Ms. Capeci said, were inspired by the popularity not only of cat videos but also of so-called lolcats, the online photographs of cats with grammatically idiosyncratic captions, like “I Can Has Cheezburger,” which is also the name of a popular Web site that features lolcats. Because the product — and the broader category of odor-reducing litter pails — is relatively new, the videos needed to convey how the Litter Genie functioned. “You can either say it in a voice-over and be terribly boring or say it in a song and have fun with it,” said Billy Faraut, a creative director at JWT. A cat, Walter, is featured in all three videos and a television commercial for Litter Genie , by Grey New York that was introduced in September. The videos and commercial are both aimed at women ages 25 to 54. Cats live in 38.9 million households in the United States, according the American Pet Products Association, a trade group. That is second only to dogs, which are in 46.3 million households. But because cat owners are more likely to have more than one, cats as pets outnumber dogs, with 86.4 million, compared with 78.2 million dogs. Diaper Genie has an 85.4 percent share of the market for diaper disposal systems, according to Nielsen data cited by the brand. Chikako Harada, the senior brand manager for Litter Genie, is a former brand manager at Diaper Genie. She said that while the products serve a similar function, the tone of marketing for the cat product was more irreverent. “Cat culture is very fun, and people dress up their cats, and it allows us to poke fun a little bit,” said Ms. Harada. “But on the baby side, it’s more ‘oohs’ and cuddles.” Like Schick, the razor brand, also owned by Energizer, the company makes more money from the replacement cartridges than from the devices. At PetSmart, the device has a retail price of $18, while cartridge refills, which last about two months, cost $12. Ms. Harada said the base unit was priced relatively low to entice people to at least try it out. “And we know that the product satisfaction is so high and that people really loved it when they tried it, so we could be a little more profitable with the refills.” Julie Klausner, a comedy writer and performer, interviews celebrities on her podcast, How Was Your Week? But she also frequently mentions Internet cat phenomena and her own cat, Jimmy Jazz. Ms. Klausner said her favorite YouTube cat video stars include Maru, whose amusing habits include getting his head stuck in boxes, with more than 194 million views on his YouTube channel; two cats playing patty-cake, with more than 16 million views of a single video; and Henri, a cat to whom a sense of ennui is ascribed in four short videos in the style of French noir films, with more than 11 million views collectively. Ms. Klausner acknowledged that the Litter Genie videos were well produced, but she said she found the elaborate sets less compelling than cats behaving in inherently amusing ways in living rooms. “It’s a lot funnier to see Maru jump into a box,” she said. “It’s advertising funny,” said Ms. Klausner of the music videos. “But comedy funny is actually funny, and advertising funny is just funny for advertising.”",

    "source": "Former Player Helps Purdue Return to Prominence <eos> In 2004, Matt Painter completed a 25-win season with Southern Illinois and then signed on as the head-coach-in-waiting at his alma mater, Purdue, as Gene Keady took one last victory lap before retirement. But instead of chasing a Big Ten title with Keady, Painter endured a 7-21 season, Purdue’s worst since 1953. Southern Illinois, meanwhile, finished 27-8. “It was difficult,” Painter said in a telephone interview. “Southern Illinois was winning every game they played while we were getting our doors blown off. But you have to look at the big picture.” The big picture is considerably brighter now at Purdue, where Painter has led the Boilermakers to a 23-6 record, a No. 15 ranking and a tie with Wisconsin for the Big Ten lead going into Tuesday’s game at Ohio State. Purdue’s state rival, Indiana, seems to be getting more attention this season, following an N.C.A.A. investigation and the mid-season resignation of Coach Kelvin Sampson. Painter, meanwhile, has quietly nurtured a defensive-minded team dominated by freshmen and sophomores and reignited interest in a program that has not won a Big Ten title since 1996. Attendance is up. Students have been camping out all night for tickets. And they stormed the court on Jan. 26 for the first time in 16 years after the Boilermakers beat Wisconsin, then ranked No. 11. “The student body, they’re really just loving the experience,” said Chris Kramer, a sophomore guard and the team captain. “People are camping out. They’re in line all day. They’re skipping class.” Purdue officials banned the overnight camping after winter weather turned bitterly cold. But Painter, who grew up in Muncie, Ind., has endeared himself to the students waiting in line by bringing them doughnuts and chicken wings. Painter, 37, played guard at Purdue from 1989 to 1993, a span in which the Boilermakers made three trips to the N.C.A.A. tournament. He was an outspoken player who served as captain as a senior and sometimes butted heads with Keady. “At the time, he was trying to help me as a player and I was trying to coach the team,” Painter said. “I had the roles reversed a little bit.” After bouncing around as an assistant following his graduation, Painter took a job at Southern Illinois in 1998. His boss was Bruce Weber, who had been an assistant at Purdue when Painter played there. When Weber was hired by Illinois in 2003, Painter was promoted to coach. A year later, he headed back to Purdue. He started recruiting almost immediately, focusing on high school sophomores with whom he could establish early relationships, even if it took several years before they paid off. At the time, he could not promise a run at a Big Ten title. But he dangled something almost as valuable. “It’s very difficult to recruit when you’re losing,” Painter said. “But the one thing you can always sell is that they can come in here and play.” That was what attracted Kramer, who played at Huntington North High School in northeastern Indiana. He had offers from Purdue, Iowa and some smaller colleges. But he committed early to the Boilermakers, hopeful that he would play as a freshman and confident that Painter could turn things around. “That 7-21 season, I didn’t think it would happen again,” Kramer said. The Boilermakers finished 9-19, and last in the Big Ten, in Painter’s first season as coach. But last season, Purdue was 22-12 and lost to Florida, the eventual champion, in the second round of the N.C.A.A. tournament. The seniors David Teague and Carl Landry combined to average more than 33 points a game. This season, the freshmen E’Twaun Moore (12.1) and Robbie Hummel (11.7) lead Purdue in scoring. Keady expresses paternal pride in Painter, his protégé, adding that Painter’s success is due, in part, to recruiting and improved team chemistry. “He got better players that are on the same page,” said Keady, now an analyst for the Big Ten Network. “They’re locked in and together, like we used to have. They’re not N.B.A. players yet. But they’re players who can win.” Painter said he was not so sure before the season. He knew he had a talented team, but he did not know if they could build a résumé good enough to return to N.C.A.A. tournament. “You know they can play,” Painter said. “You just don’t know what to expect. It’s hard to be good.” Now, though, he knows what to expect.",

    "source": "Mavericks Prevail and Send Lakers Into Panic Mode <eos> LOS ANGELES — The Lakers celebrated last June on the Staples Center court in gold glitter when Kobe Bryant persevered, Pau Gasol dominated and Ron Artest chipped in. They had outlasted the Boston Celtics and cemented another championship. On the same court Wednesday, the Dallas Mavericks left the Lakers dizzy. The Lakers were booed at several intervals and stunned in what could be their final game there this season and Phil Jackson ’s last as their coach. Bryant’s scoring had little impact, Gasol was ineffective and Artest was ejected. The result was a 93-81 loss to the Mavericks and the burden of digging from a 2-0 crater as the Western Conference semifinals shifts to Dallas. With balanced scoring, a choking defense and a steady diet of Dirk Nowitzki jumpers, the Mavericks came here and seized two games— a feat that perhaps only those in their locker room believed could be accomplished. The Mavericks can gain entrance to the conference finals without having to visit Los Angeles again this postseason. “It’s one of 16 that we need, and right now we’ve got 10 more wins to get to our goal,” Dallas Coach Rick Carlisle said. Only 18 teams before Wednesday had entered a series with homecourt advantage and lost the first two games of a playoff series. The Lakers (1969), the Rockets (1994) and the Mavericks (2005) are the only teams that came back to win the series. The last time the Lakers trailed, 2-0, in a playoff series was in the 2008 finals when they lost to the Celtics. In the next two seasons, the Lakers claimed championships. “It’s a challenge, that’s for sure,” Jackson said. The loss arrived after the Lakers collapsed in the series opener and fumbled away a 16-point lead. It also revealed deeper cracks in the Lakers’ championship façade. “I think all 13 of our guys have trust issues right now,” said center Andrew Bynum, who had 18 points and 13 rebounds after having little impact in the first game. “I mean, it’s quite obvious to anyone watching the game: hesitation on passes, defensively, not being there for your teammate because he wasn’t there for you before. Stuff like that.” Artest was ejected late in the game when he received his second technical foul for clotheslining Jose Barea, who was efficient in driving past the taller Lakers interior players throughout the game. The league will probably review the play, and it may warrant further penalty. “It was uncalled for,” Jackson said. “There’s a good chance he’ll be suspended. I hope not.” Artest left without talking to the news media. Nowitzki had 24 points and 7 rebounds after he had 28 and 14 in the series opener. The Lakers even tried Artest, who is smaller but stronger, on Nowitzki. Nowitzki simply rose and shot over him. “Dirk’s one of the hardest guys to guard in the history of basketball,” Carlisle said. “It’s not tonight. It’s ever night.” Nowitzki is doing his part to shed a label that each of the Mavericks carry. In 2006, Miami rallied from a 2-0 series deficit to win the N.B.A. finals against Dallas. The next season, when Nowitzki won the M.V.P., Dallas was bounded in the first round. Ever since, Dallas has been regarded as a superior regular-season team that wilts in the playoffs. “We talked about it and this series is far from over,” Nowitzki said. “I’ve been around a long time. I’ve been up, 2-0, before and ended up losing the series. And I’ve been down, 2-0, lost both games to Houston a couple years ago, and came back and won Game 7. So we’ve seen a lot of things happen in this league.” Barea’s layup early in the fourth quarter stretched Dallas’s lead to 75-65. The lead ballooned to 15 points before Bryant hit a 3-pointer, the only one of the five 3-point attempts he made. Bryant scored 14 of his 23 points in the first half, when the Lakers stayed in the game. The Lakers scored only 32 points in the second half, shot only 41 percent for the game and missed 18 of their 20 3-pointers. “Desperate is a strong word,” Bryant said of the team’s mood. “I think, when you play desperate, you don’t play your best basketball. What we need to do is relax, we need to focus on what we’re doing wrong and the mistakes that we’re making, and we have plenty to review.” The Lakers normally excel as playoff series evolve. They lost the first-round series opener to the Chris Paul-fueled New Orleans Hornets. But Gasol (13 points and 10 rebounds on Wednesday) and Bynum are playing unevenly and the Laker bench managed only 12 points on 23 shots. Lamar Odom, awarded this season’s sixth man of the year award, missed 9 of his 12 shots. Jackson is intent on retiring after the season, and before the game he admitted that the opening loss against Dallas was more severe than the first-round setback against New Orleans. “We’re worried now,” he said. “This is a good team. We know that they have the same record we have. They have a lot of options in scoring, and we’ve got to play a lot better to overcome this team in the course of the series. Our strength is we’ve always become better and better against teams in series. We hope to do that.” Still, after the game, and another loss, Jackson tried to keep his sense of humor. When asked what he would do to jump-start the Lakers at Thursday’s practice, Jackson said, “I plan on flogging them tomorrow.” REBOUNDS The Lakers received clarification on the substitution glitch that Phil Jackson contested with the league office, Jackson said. In the closing moments of Game 1, he attempted to remove Andrew Bynum after Dallas went to a smaller lineup after a timeout with 20.3 seconds remaining. But no time had lapsed after Bynum had been originally inserted and he had to remain in for at least one play, in accordance with league rules. “They wanted to clarify that, fine, you can substitute anybody back in, but Bynum had to stay in,” Jackson said.",

    "source": "Touring Slum in Rio, Pope Urges Young to Fight Against Corruption <eos> RIO DE JANEIRO — Pope Francis on Thursday delivered some of his most politically provocative remarks since his papacy began this year , hopping from his popemobile to walk through a slum in this city before urging young people to fight against corruption, a leading grievance behind the huge street protests that shook dozens of Brazilian cities in June. “Do not grow accustomed to evil, but defeat it,” Francis said at the favela, or slum, of Varginha, in an area that has commonly been known here as the Gaza Strip for its gun battles and drug trafficking in the past. “Do not lose trust, do not allow your hope to be extinguished,” he added, acknowledging that it was common for some to “grow disillusioned with news of corruption.” By singling out corruption in a folksy visit to a Brazilian favela on his first trip abroad as pope, Francis, an Argentine-born Jesuit, emphasized his aim to refocus the Roman Catholic Church on the neglected margins of society, especially in Brazil and other parts of Latin America where the popularity of evangelical churches has surged among the poor in recent decades. In a nod to the Brazilian political authorities who have warmly welcomed him, Francis also praised the government’s antipoverty programs and did not specifically mention the anti-establishment protests in Brazil. But he did critique Rio de Janeiro’s so-called pacification project in the city’s slums, in which security forces assert control over lawless areas. “No amount of pacification will be able to last, nor will harmony and happiness be attained in a society that ignores, pushes to the margins or excludes a part of itself,” the pope said in Varginha, a slum that has recently been subjected to pacification. In a remark that could resonate in Latin America and in the United States, which is also grappling with the widening disparity between the haves and the have-nots, Francis said that a society “impoverishes itself” by perpetuating such inequality. Care for the poor and marginalized is an integral part of Catholic teaching, and a concern of many popes and encyclicals, including those by Francis’ predecessor, Benedict XVI. But Francis has made it a hallmark of his young papacy, telling journalists in Rome days after his election, “How I would like a church that is poor and for the poor.” He has demonstrated that ideal by living relatively humbly as pope: in a communal guesthouse rather than the opulent papal apartment, wearing a pectoral cross of iron instead of gold, flying commercial. He recently told priests that they should not drive fancy cars, and he has traveled around Rio this week in a compact Fiat. “He is helping to wake people up,” said Natalia Morais, 21, a nursing student from Minas Gerais State who traveled to Rio to see the pope as part of World Youth Day, a conference attended by hundreds of thousands of Catholic youth. “When the pope talks, political leaders listen, and that’s what’s needed in Brazil, where our protests are about their corruption,” Ms. Morais said. Reaching beyond Brazil, Francis told Argentines who came here for the conference that “the church must be taken into the streets” in a struggle against complacency. “Stir things up, cause confounding, but do not diminish faith in Jesus Christ,” he said in Spanish. Not all Brazilians are thrilled with Francis’ visit, which the local news media has covered in detail. Some evangelical Christians, who account for about 22 percent of the country’s population, have pointed out that the Catholic Church enjoys many privileges in Brazil, including millions of dollars of government spending for the pope’s trip. “The Catholic Church has always had lots of money and support from the government,” said Elizeu Sousa Teixeira, 31, a security guard at an evangelical church in Brasília, the capital. “It’s political.” In each of Francis’ public appearances, he has been accorded a rock-star reception. On an uncommonly cold and rainy morning, hundreds of residents lined the narrow, muddy sidewalks of the Varginha favela to glimpse the first pope from the Americas, who obliged by stopping often to touch and bless people. Many onlookers had made their own shirts to commemorate the event, with a photo of Francis. Others draped themselves in Brazilian flags and waved banners bearing his image. Residents darted in and out of their homes, checking their televisions and radios to learn the pope’s whereabouts and calling the information out to their neighbors standing on wet rooftops to get a better view. Sônia Curato, 48, a manicurist, said the pope’s visit was different from that of other leaders. “Politicians come all the time. They make promises and leave,” she said. “He is a very simple person. You can tell that. He has charisma. He speaks to the people, doesn’t like going around in an armored car.” Others were more focused on the opportunities the visit presented. Josenil Guedes da Silva, 36, had driven down to the favela from his home in Recife to sell souvenirs, including a mug with the pope’s photo for about $5. With 600 mugs and 1,000 key chains, he said, “I came to do business.”",

    "source": "When One Farm Subsidy Ends, Another May Rise to Replace It <eos> It seems a rare act of civic sacrifice: in the name of deficit reduction, lawmakers from both parties are calling for the end of a longstanding agricultural subsidy that puts about $5 billion a year in the pockets of their farmer constituents. Even major farm groups are accepting the move, saying that with farmers poised to reap bumper profits, they must do their part. But in the same breath, the lawmakers and their farm lobby allies are seeking to send most of that money — under a new name — straight back to the same farmers, with most of the benefits going to large farms that grow commodity crops like corn, soybeans, wheat and cotton. In essence, lawmakers would replace one subsidy with a new one. “We are very much aware of the budgetary constraints of the federal government,” said Garry Niemeyer, an Illinois farmer who is president of the National Corn Growers Association . “We want to do our part as corn growers to help resolve those issues, but we only want to do our proportional part. We don’t want to have everything taken out on us.” But Vincent H. Smith, a professor of farm economics at Montana State University, called the maneuver a bait and switch. “There’s a persistent story that farming is on the edge of catastrophe in America and that’s why they need safety nets that other people don’t get,” he said. “And the reality is that it’s really a very healthy industry.” The subsidy swap is gaining momentum as lawmakers seek to influence the cuts in farm programs that are expected to be made by a special Congressional panel charged with slashing $1.2 trillion from future budgets. On Monday, leaders of the House and Senate agriculture committees said they were preparing recommendations for $23 billion in unspecified cuts over 10 years, far less than some other proposals. Lawmakers’ reluctance to simply eliminate a subsidy without adding another in its place demonstrates how difficult it is for Washington to trim the federal largess that flows to any powerful interest group. Indeed, the $5 billion program that lawmakers are willing to throw under the tractor, known as the direct payment program , was created in 1996 as a way to wean farmers off all such supports — and instead was made permanent a few years later. The new subsidy is being championed by Senator Sherrod Brown , Democrat of Ohio , and Senator John Thune , Republican of South Dakota . Mr. Thune, a leading voice in favor of deficit reduction, received at least $80,000 in campaign contributions since 2007 from political action committees associated with commodity agriculture, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending. Mr. Brown has received $5,500 in PAC contributions from such groups in that period. It is unclear how much support a new subsidy would garner, since many lawmakers view farm programs as a likely source of budget savings. Critics say that farm subsidies today have little to do with helping struggling family farmers. Instead, they go predominantly to well-financed operations with large landholdings. All told, the subsidies amount to about $18 billion a year — about half of 1 percent of the federal budget . An analysis of federal data by the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that tracks farm subsidies , showed that the top 10 percent of direct-payment recipients in 2010 received 59 percent of the money under the program. Those 88,000 people, including farmers, their spouses and absentee landowners, got an average of $29,598. In lean times, such support might seem vital, but in recent years commodity farmers have done well. The Agriculture Department forecasts that farm profits this year, measured on a cash basis, will total $115 billion, 24 percent higher than last year, thanks to soaring crop prices. Adjusted for inflation, profits are expected to be at their highest level since 1974. The average income for farm households has been higher than general household incomes every year since 1996. The average household income was $87,780 for all farms in 2010, and $201,465 for families living on large farms. “How do you justify this kind of money going to a sector of the economy that’s booming while other folks in the country are suffering?” Craig Cox, a senior vice president of the Environmental Working Group, said of the subsidies. Lobbyists and farm-state lawmakers have long argued that farmers face risks, like bad weather, pests and volatile markets, that merit special treatment. Direct payments have come under fire, however, because farmers get them whether markets are high or low. The new subsidy, called shallow-loss protection, would act as a free insurance policy to cover commodity farmers against small drops in revenue. Most commodity farmers already buy crop insurance to protect themselves against major losses caused by large drops in prices or damage to crops. Those policies typically guarantee 75 to 85 percent of a farmer’s revenue, with the federal government spending $6 billion a year to pay more than half the cost of farmers’ premiums. The proposed new subsidy would add another layer of protection to guarantee 10 to 15 percent of a farmer’s revenue, paying out not only in years of heavy losses, but also when revenue dipped less severely. The shallow-loss plan getting the most attention is in a bill introduced last month by Senators Brown and Thune that would simplify and expand an existing program. Gary D. Schnitkey, a professor of farm management at the University of Illinois , said the Brown-Thune plan would help protect farmers during longer periods of depressed prices. Without such a program, he said, “we would see financial stress and we would see farmers go out of business.” It is unclear how much the proposal would cost taxpayers. Dr. Schnitkey said the plan could pay farmers $40 billion over 10 years . That would be $20 billion less than the programs it replaced, including direct payments and some smaller subsidies. But Dr. Smith, the Montana State economist, said the cost could be much greater because the plan used recent high crop prices as its benchmark. “If farm prices move back towards what are widely viewed as more normal levels than their current levels, farmers will be compensated for going back to business as usual,” he said. In a statement Senator Thune said the proposal in the bill “corrects inefficiencies in several farm programs with a streamlined and cheaper approach.” Representative Marlin A. Stutzman, an Indiana Republican, said that a shallow-loss plan would give farmers more flexibility in managing risk. “Farmers shouldn’t have to pay the brunt of the deficit problem,” he said. Mr. Stutzman and Senator Richard Lugar, also an Indiana Republican, included the Brown-Thune plan in matching farm bills they introduced this month. Congress is due to write a new five-year farm bill next year, but some lawmakers want to use the deficit-cutting process to revamp farm spending. President Obama has proposed cutting $33 billion from farm programs over 10 years, including ending direct payments without adding a shallow-loss program. Mr. Stutzman’s bill would slice $40 billion, with more than half coming from programs like food stamps and soil and water conservation.",

    "source": "Saudi Diplomat in India Is Accused of Rape <eos> NEW DELHI — The Indian police are investigating allegations that a Saudi diplomat imprisoned and repeatedly raped two Nepali maids who worked in his home. The Saudi Embassy has denied the allegations. As a diplomat, the Saudi man, who has not been identified publicly, has immunity from criminal prosecution, but may be expelled if the Indian government finds the allegations substantiated. Navdeep Singh Virk, the top police official in Gurgaon, where the diplomat lives, said Wednesday that the police had delivered a report on their investigation to the Ministry of External Affairs. The case brings together two issues that have drawn wide public attention in recent years: the problems that India’s police have had in dealing with rape, and the mistreatment of domestic workers in many parts of Asia and the Middle East. Acting on a tip from an advocacy group, the Indian police removed the two women from the diplomat’s apartment on Monday. In a statement on Wednesday, the police said an investigation of rape and illegal confinement had been opened based on what the women told them, that “they were beaten up, raped, abused and threatened by the family and their guests.” Rajesh Kumar, a police official, said the women, who have not been publicly identified, were 50 and 25 years old. In a televised interview wth the ANI news agency, one of the women, her face covered by a scarf, said the two had been confined in a room in the apartment and were repeatedly raped, sometimes by as many as five or six men. The Saudi Embassy in New Delhi said Wednesday in a statement that it “strongly stresses that these allegations are false and have not been proven,” the Press Trust of India reported. The embassy also objected to “unwarranted media briefings before investigations are complete,” and had formally protested the police intrusion into the diplomat’s home, the news service reported. In the televised interview, one of the women said they were employed through a Delhi agent. They were hired several months ago and were taken to Jidda, Saudi Arabia, for a time before returning to India, they told the police, according to Wednesday’s statement. A third maid who worked for the diplomat and his family until August went to Maiti India, a group that aids victims of human trafficking, and told the group that she was compelled to work to the point of exhaustion, denied pay and given too little to eat, adding that the other two women were suffering poor conditions as well. The Maiti India group then approached the police. The third maid, who spoke on condition that her name not be published, said in an interview that while she was in the Saudi family’s employ, she never witnessed any sexual assault or heard complaints about it from other maids. Mr. Kumar said a medical examination of the two women found that they had indeed been raped. Mr. Virk, the commissioner of police in Gurgaon, said the examinations were only preliminary and declined to give any specifics.",

    "source": "Court in France Upholds Trader’s Sentence and Fine <eos> PARIS — A French appeals court on Wednesday upheld the 2010 conviction of Jérôme Kerviel , a former Société Générale trader whose rogue dealings brought the French bank to the brink of collapse almost five years ago. In her ruling, the appellate judge, Mireille Filippini, also upheld Mr. Kerviel’s original prison sentence of five years, with two suspended, and the trial court’s order that he pay 4.9 billion euros, or $6.4 billion, in restitution to Société Générale — equivalent to the amount the bank lost in the course of unwinding his fictitious trades in early 2008. Mr. Kerviel, 35, was found guilty by a lower court two years ago of breach of trust, forgery and unauthorized use of computer systems. The former trader, dressed in a dark suit and tie, listened impassively on Wednesday as Judge Filippini read the verdict to a wood-paneled courtroom packed with journalists. He was not ordered into immediate custody. Addressing reporters after the hearing, Mr. Kerviel’s lawyer, David Koubbi, called the judge’s decision a “lamentable injustice.” Mr. Kerviel left the courtroom through a side door without speaking to reporters. But in an interview with the RTL radio station later Wednesday, he said the verdict had left him “totally shattered” and vowed to appeal it to France’s highest court, the Cour de Cassation. The unwinding of an estimated 50 billion euros in unauthorized open positions on Mr. Kerviel’s trading book in January 2008 cost Société Générale 4.9 billion euros, the equivalent of about $7 billion at the time. Mr. Kerviel acknowledged at his original trial that he had falsified documents and entered fake trades to hide his activities, but said he had never profited personally from those transactions. He maintained that his bosses had deliberately turned a blind eye to what he was doing and had tacitly encouraged him as long as it was profitable. The bank has consistently denied those assertions, calling Mr. Kerviel an “evil genius” who acted entirely on his own. The judge’s 105-page ruling was unrelenting in its affirmation of the three charges against Mr. Kerviel and of the lower court’s calculation of the fine. “To the extent that Société Générale was perhaps negligent or maybe didn’t read all the warning signs, that didn’t serve to reduce the amount of damages or amount of prison time given to him,” said Christopher Mesnooh, a specialist in international business law with Field Fisher Waterhouse in Paris. “It is a lesson in personal responsibility in the extreme. This decision really is about Jérôme Kerviel and nobody else.” Jean Veil, a lawyer for the 148-year-old bank, said he was “very satisfied” with the court’s ruling but acknowledged that Mr. Kerviel, who is unemployed, was unlikely ever to repay the bank the full sum it was awarded. “We will look at the dossier with realism,” Mr. Veil said. But he vowed to pursue royalty payments linked to a memoir Mr. Kerviel published in 2010 and to any future film deals. Société Générale has admitted to management failures and weaknesses in its risk control systems, which it claimed Mr. Kerviel exploited to mask his unauthorized bets. An internal audit published in May 2008 described Mr. Kerviel’s immediate supervisors as “deficient” and acknowledged that the bank had failed to follow through on at least 74 internal alerts about his trading activities dating to mid-2006. The French Banking Commission later fined Société Générale 4 million euros. The bank dismissed two of Mr. Kerviel’s supervisors, and a handful of senior executives ultimately resigned, including Daniel Bouton, who had been Société Générale’s chairman and chief executive. Auditors found that Mr. Kerviel had been placing bets outside his trading limit for more than two years. Société Générale confirmed that it booked 1.4 billion euros in profit in the fourth quarter of 2007 from his unauthorized dealings. But when the market turned against him, eight large transactions entered into the bank’s computers in mid-December 2007 exposed the bank to 50 billion euros in risk — more than the market value of the bank. His last and, by far, biggest gamble was discovered Jan. 18, 2008. It was the unwinding of those trades, from Jan. 21 to Jan. 23, that led to the loss of 4.9 billion euros. In the aftermath of the scandal, Mr. Kerviel spent five weeks in pretrial detention and became something of a French folk hero. Much was made of the fact that someone from such a modest background — his mother was a hairdresser, his late father a metal-shop teacher — could dupe so many of his bosses, many of them well-bred graduates of the best French schools. The Société Générale scandal was one of the first fractures in the facade of what was then broadly perceived as an aggressive but essentially self-regulating financial system, giving rise to early calls against excessive risk-taking and lavish bonuses that have grown steadily louder since. It came not long after the first indications of the subprime mortgage crisis surfaced in the United States in August 2007 and was followed in March and September of 2008 by the demise of two flagship investment banks, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.",

    "source": "Six Months After Sandy, Jersey Shore Is Ready to Run <eos> When Joe Gigas, the executive director of the New Jersey Marathon, returned to his home in Long Branch after evacuating for Hurricane Sandy, he found that the ocean had ripped off one side of his house and sucked out the contents of four rooms. Still, only a week after the storm, he announced on the races’ Facebook page that the New Jersey Marathon and the Long Branch Half Marathon would be contested in 2013, although he did not know how, or where. Unlike the New York City Marathon, which was scheduled for Nov. 4, less than a week after the storm, the New Jersey races had the benefit of time. Gigas had six months to meet with eight Monmouth County municipalities, rework the courses so they avoided damaged roads and broken boardwalks, haggle with USA Track & Field over differences in maps — the national organization’s map showed the marathon course to be 200 meters short of 26.2 miles — and then have the races certified, all by May 5. USA Track & Field measured and certified the courses Thursday. Without certification, runners would not be able to use their race times to qualify for elite races like the Boston Marathon. “It’s still raw,” Gigas said last month. “Homeowners are not back in their houses yet. I’m not back in my house yet.” (Gigas said he was living in a rental.) When he approached town officials about the marathon this year, their reaction, he said, was not no but whether it would be safe. All eight towns eventually signed off on it. The two races start at the Monmouth Park racetrack in Oceanport, and the first miles wind through Oceanport and Monmouth Beach, which were flooded by Sandy. More than half of Oceanport’s 2,400 homes were damaged. In Monmouth Beach, the course will pass many houses that look fine on the outside but have Dumpsters and storage units in the driveway, because of the work that needs to be done on them. Some houses will be on jacks, as they are being raised to meet new elevation requirements set by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. For Adam Schneider, the mayor of Long Branch, there was no question the races would be run. He said they would uplift residents, many of whom have parties along the racecourse. Then there is the economic benefit, which is especially needed this year. The half marathon and the full marathon end in Long Branch, and Schneider estimated that 15,000 people line the final miles to the finish. “It’s a relatively early spring day, and if we didn’t have a race, there would be very few people in town,” he said. “Instead, we’re busting from the seams.” He said he would be a part of it, too, running the Long Branch Half for the fourth time. Ninety percent of the two courses will remain the same, but rerouting the other 10 percent was tricky. The half marathon runs through three towns, the full marathon through eight. Gigas had to obtain approval of the new routes from each police department and town government before submitting them to USA Track & Field. Some landmark features of the marathon had to be sacrificed. In Asbury Park, it is typically run on the boardwalk, through the Grand Arcade of Convention Hall , where Bruce Springsteen has often rehearsed before touring, and the vestibule of the Casino , a former concert and amusement hall razed several years ago. Boardwalk repairs are scheduled to be completed by the end of April, but that did not leave enough time for the new course to be certified. Instead, runners will go down Kingsley Street and make the cross into Ocean Grove over a narrow pedestrian bridge. Because of that detour, there will be no wheelchair race in the full marathon this year. Gigas said the bridge was not the only factor making this year’s course less than ideal. The route also requires an abrupt turn around at a cone in Ocean Grove, which can throw off runners’ pace and cadence. Among them will be Oz Pearlman , a New York City magician and two-time winner who set the course record in 2011 with a time of 2 hours 28 minutes 19 seconds. Jen Matz, who spent her childhood summers at the Jersey Shore, will be running the Long Branch Half for the first time. She ran the Seaside Half Marathon two weeks before Hurricane Sandy, which destroyed a family member’s home in Lavallette, farther south on the Jersey Shore. Matz, who grew up in Monmouth County, but now lives in South Carolina, is running to promote the shore area. She said she would write about it on her blog at runnerstrials.com. “Maybe things don’t look exactly like they did, but the Jersey Shore is still a great place to go and race,” she said. “I want to draw attention to that.” So far, registrations for the half marathon are slightly down from last year, but those for the full marathon are up 15 percent. Gigas expects about 3,500 people to run the marathon, the most in its 17-year history. “I never really got that phrase Jersey Strong,” said Gigas, who grew up in New Hampshire. “But watching these municipalities deal with this, and then there’s me asking, ‘Can I run through your town?’ No one said no. It’s that Jersey can-do attitude.”",

    "source": "Manhattan Prosecutors Won’t Charge Police Commissioner’s Son in Rape Accusation <eos> Manhattan prosecutors have decided not to file rape charges against a son of Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly after a two-week investigation of a woman’s accusation that he had attacked her late last year inside the Lower Manhattan law office where she worked, prosecutors said in a letter on Tuesday. The office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. , concluded its inquiry into the accusation leveled against Mr. Kelly’s son Greg Kelly, a local television anchor, concluding that “the facts established during our investigation do not fit the definition of sexual assault crimes,” according to a brief letter to Mr. Kelly’s lawyer, Andrew M. Lankler. “Therefore, no criminal charges are appropriate.” A spokeswoman for the district attorney’s office said it had conducted a “thorough investigation,” interviewing witnesses and analyzing evidence including security logs, text messages, receipts and phone records. The letter , from the chief of the district attorney’s Sex Crimes Unit, Martha Bashford, the assistant district attorney assigned to handle the case, said the witnesses included the accuser and Mr. Kelly, “both of whom were cooperative and were interviewed in the first days of the investigation.” In a statement, Mr. Kelly said, “I am thankful that the investigation established what I’ve known all along, that I am innocent of the allegations that were waged against me.” He thanked his friends and family, “whose support for me never wavered.” The accusations came to light after the woman, who is in her late 20s or early 30s and whose name was not released, walked into the 13th Precinct station house on Jan. 24. She told the police that she had met Mr. Kelly, 43, on the street and had gone for drinks with him at the South Street Seaport a few days later, on Oct. 8. Afterward, she said, they returned to her office and he raped her. Police detectives initially interviewed the woman in the hours after she walked into the station house last month, law enforcement officials said at the time. But within hours, the Police Department had turned the investigation over to Mr. Vance’s office because of the conflict presented by the department’s looking into a sexual assault accusation against the commissioner’s son, who from the outset denied the accusations through Mr. Lankler. After the allegations became public, Mr. Kelly, a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Reserves, took a leave from his position as an anchor of “Good Day New York” on the Fox station WNYW (Channel 5). While the woman told the police that Mr. Kelly had raped her after they returned to her office, she told them that the two continued to have contact by phone and text message after the encounter. According to her account, when her boyfriend later learned about the night, he became angry and approached the police commissioner at a public event and told him that the younger Mr. Kelly had sexually assaulted his girlfriend. The commissioner told him to write a letter, according to the woman’s account, but it did not appear that he did so. Commissioner Kelly’s account of his encounter with the boyfriend was similar, though according to his spokesman, Paul J. Browne, the man told the commissioner that his son had “ruined my girlfriend’s life” but declined to discuss it there. So the commissioner suggested that he write the letter.",

    "source": "F.C.C. Approves Net Neutrality Rules, Classifying Broadband Internet Service as a Utility <eos> WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to regulate broadband Internet service as a public utility, a milestone in regulating high-speed Internet service into American homes. Tom Wheeler, the commission chairman, said the F.C.C. was using “all the tools in our toolbox to protect innovators and consumers” and preserve the Internet’s role as a “core of free expression and democratic principles.” The new rules, approved 3 to 2 along party lines, are intended to ensure that no content is blocked and that the Internet is not divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for Internet and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else. Those prohibitions are hallmarks of the net neutrality concept. Explaining the reason for the regulation, Mr. Wheeler, a Democrat, said that Internet access was “too important to let broadband providers be the ones making the rules.” Mobile data service for smartphones and tablets, in addition to wired lines, is being placed under the new rules. The order also includes provisions to protect consumer privacy and to ensure that Internet service is available to people with disabilities and in remote areas. Before the vote, each of the five commissioners spoke and the Republicans delivered a scathing critique of the order as overly broad, vague and unnecessary. Ajit Pai, a Republican commissioner, said the rules were government meddling in a vibrant, competitive market and were likely to deter investment, undermine innovation and ultimately harm consumers. “The Internet is not broken,” Mr. Pai said. “There is no problem to solve.” The impact of the new rules will hinge partly on details that are not yet known. The rules will not be published for at least a couple of days, and will not take effect for probably at least a couple of months. Lawsuits to challenge the commission’s order are widely expected. The F.C.C. is taking this big regulatory step by reclassifying high-speed Internet service as a telecommunications service, instead of an information service, under Title II of the Telecommunications Act. The Title II classification comes from the phone company era, treating service as a public utility. But the new rules are an à la carte version of Title II, adopting some provisions and shunning others. The F.C.C. will not get involved in pricing decisions or the engineering decisions companies make in managing their networks. Mr. Wheeler, who gave a forceful defense of the rules just ahead of the vote, said the tailored approach was anything but old-style utility regulation. “These are a 21st-century set of rules for a 21st-century industry,” he said. Opponents of the new rules, led by cable television and telecommunications companies, say adopting the Title II approach opens the door to bureaucratic interference with business decisions that, if let stand, would reduce incentives to invest and thus raise prices and hurt consumers. “Today, the F.C.C. took one of the most regulatory steps in its history,” Michael Powell, president of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and a chairman of the F.C.C. in the Bush administration, said in a statement. “The commission has breathed new life into the decayed telephone regulatory model and applied it to the most dynamic, freewheeling and innovative platform in history.” Supporters of the Title II model include many major Internet companies, start-ups and public interest groups. In a statement, Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, which includes Google, Facebook and smaller online companies, called the F.C.C. vote “a welcome step in our effort to create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules.” The F.C.C.’s yearlong path to issuing rules to ensure an open Internet precipitated an extraordinary level of political involvement, from grass-roots populism to the White House, for a regulatory ruling. The F.C.C. received four million comments, about a quarter of them generated through a campaign organized by groups including Fight for the Future, an advocacy nonprofit. Evan Greer, campaign director for Fight for the Future, said, “This shows that the Internet has changed the rules of what can be accomplished in Washington.” Image Supporters of net neutrality rallied on Thursday outside the F.C.C. building. Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times An overwhelming majority of the comments supported common-carrier style rules, like those in the order the commission approved on Thursday. In the public meeting, Mr. Wheeler began his remarks by noting the flood of public comments. “We listened and we learned,” he said. In November, President Obama took the unusual step of urging the F.C.C., an independent agency, to adopt the “strongest possible rules” on net neutrality. Mr. Obama specifically called on the commission to classify high-speed broadband service as a utility under Title II. His rationale: “For most Americans, the Internet has become an essential part of everyday communication and everyday life.” Republicans in Congress were slow to react, and initially misread the public mood. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas portrayed the F.C.C. rule-making process as a heavy-handed liberal initiative, “Obamacare for the Internet.” In January, Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican, began circulating legislation that embraced the principles of net neutrality, banning both paid-for priority lanes and the blocking or throttling of any web content. But it would also prohibit the F.C.C. from issuing regulations to achieve those goals. This week, the Republicans pulled back , with too little support to move quickly. Also at the Thursday meeting, the F.C.C. approved an order to pre-empt state laws that limit the build-out of municipal broadband Internet services. The order focuses on laws in two states, North Carolina and Tennessee, but it would create a policy framework for other states. About 20 states, by the F.C.C.’s count, have laws that restrict the activities of community broadband services. The state laws unfairly restrict municipal competition with cable and telecommunications broadband providers, the F.C.C. said. This order, too, will surely be challenged in court.",

    "source": "Stealth Wear Aims to Make a Tech Statement <eos> THE term “stealth wear” sounded cool, if a bit extreme, when I first heard it early this year. It’s a catchy description for clothing and accessories designed to protect the wearer from detection and surveillance. I was amused. It seemed like an updated version of a tinfoil hat, albeit a stylish one. Fast-forward a few months. Flying surveillance cameras, also known as drones, are increasingly in the news. So are advances in facial-recognition technology. And wearable devices like Google Glass — which can be used to take photographs and videos and upload them to the Internet within seconds — are adding to the fervor. Then there are the disclosures of Edward Snowden, the fugitive former government contractor, about clandestine government surveillance. It’s enough to make countersurveillance fashion as timely and pertinent as any seasonal trend, like midriff tops or wedge sneakers. Adam Harvey , an artist and design professor at the School of Visual Arts and an early creator of stealth wear, acknowledges that countersurveillance clothing sounds like something out of a William Gibson novel. “The science-fiction part has become a reality,” he said, “and there’s a growing need for products that offer privacy.” Image The CV Dazzle hairstyling and makeup program aims to camouflage a person’s face. Credit Adam Harvey and DIF Magazine Mr. Harvey exhibited a number of his stealth-wear designs and prototypes in an art show this year in London. His work includes a series of hoodies and cloaks that use reflective, metallic fabric — like the kind used in protective gear for firefighters — that he has repurposed to reduce a person’s thermal footprint . In theory, this limits one’s visibility to aerial surveillance vehicles employing heat-imaging cameras to track people on the ground. He also developed a purse with extra-bright LEDs that can be activated when someone is taking unwanted pictures; the effect is to reduce an intrusive photograph to a washed-out blur. In addition, he created a guide for hairstyling and makeup application that might keep a camera from recognizing the person beneath the elaborate get-up. The technique is called CV Dazzle — a riff on “computer vision” and “dazzle,” a type of camouflage used during World War II to make it hard to detect the size and shape of warships. Mr. Harvey isn’t the only one working on such products. The National Institute of Informatics in Japan has developed a visor outfitted with LEDs whose light isn’t visible to the wearer — but that would blind some camera sensors and blur the details of a wearer’s nose and eyes more effectively than a pair of sunglasses. And Todd Blatt , a mechanical engineer in New York, is working on a lens-cap accessory for people who don’t want to be recorded while talking with someone who is wearing Google Glass. Instead of asking that the computer glasses be removed entirely, they could instead hand the wearer the lens covering. Presto. No taping or photographing would occur during the conversation. Mr. Harvey likened his work and that of others to the invention of the rivet in denim jeans. “That was a practical way of making them more durable,” he said. Stealth wear, he said, is an “updated way of thinking about making your clothes more resistant to your environment and adapting them to protect you a little bit more.” But these designers face a challenge: although technology has inspired some new fabrics and materials, high-tech fashion of any kind has yet to really take off. Image A purse fitted with an electronic device reacts to a camera’s flash with lights so bright that the subject’s face is obscured. Credit Adam Harvey/ahprojects.com There simply isn’t much of a market for tech-savvy haute couture, said Becky Stern, an artist and the director of wearable electronics at Adafruit Industries , a company in New York that sells do-it-yourself electronics kits. Ms. Stern noted that a few years ago, clothing embedded with illuminated lights was relatively popular, but that interest later “kind of fell off.” Some of the most exciting experimentation is in the world of sports, she said, where athletic wear is being developed that can monitor a player’s vital signs. Such products are commercially viable, she said, and the technology could eventually migrate to clothing designed specifically to protect the privacy of its owner. Jan Chipchase, executive creative director of global insights at Frog Design , says he sees tremendous potential for an eventual stealth-wear market. He described current prototypes as “provocations,” saying they raise “issues that are impacting our cities and public spaces that need more discussion and debate.” Mr. Harvey’s items have not yet been thoroughly tested by intelligence firms or security experts. Most are still concepts, not ready for mass production. But he said he hoped that awareness of his designs might “empower you to control your identity a little more.” AND the mere fact that such designs are attracting attention online could pave the way for development of a mass market, said Joanne McNeil, a writer who covers Internet culture. On her blog “ Internet of Dreams ,” Ms. McNeil says that videos and mock-ups of not-yet-developed products, whether clothing or futuristic smartphones, are often popular online and may reflect the desires of a populace that larger corporations haven’t tapped. “Dreams outpace physical realities,” she said. In other words, even if stealth wear never becomes a viable or commercial reality, the newfound intrusiveness it responds to is genuine enough.",

    "source": "Petraeus, in Pakistan, Hears Complaints About Missile Strikes <eos> ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — In his new position as head of the United States Central Command , Gen. David H. Petraeus met top Pakistani officials on Monday for the first time and heard one message wherever he turned: American airstrikes against militants in the tribal areas are unhelpful. General Petraeus, the former commander of American forces in Iraq, arrived in Pakistan as missile strikes from drone aircraft against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Pakistan’s tribal areas had escalated. There were two separate missile attacks by American drones on Saturday. In retaliation, a suicide bomber killed eight Pakistani paramilitary soldiers in South Waziristan on Sunday. After the meeting with General Petraeus, President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan said in a statement: “Continuing drone attacks on our territory, which result in loss of precious lives and property, are counterproductive and difficult to explain by a democratically elected government. It is creating a credibility gap.” There was no comment or public appearance by General Petraeus, and it was not clear how he responded to the complaints. Messages left with his press aides were not immediately returned. General Petraeus, who has been consulting in recent weeks with a wide range of people on the efforts by the Pakistani military to quell the insurgency in the tribal areas and on the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, on Friday took over the Central Command, putting him in overall charge of the American-led military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. His visit comes as the Pentagon and the White House are completing reviews on policies toward Afghanistan, and as Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, has made clear that Pakistan and Afghanistan would be more of a foreign policy focus if he were to win the election. In an interview on CNN broadcast this past weekend, Mr. Obama said he believed it was necessary to convince Pakistan that the main threat to its security came from the militants, and not India, its historical enemy. During his round of calls on Monday, General Petraeus met with the commander of the Pakistani military, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and the defense minister, Ahmad Mukhtar. The American missile attacks in the tribal areas were generating “anti-American sentiments” and creating “outrage and uproar among the people,” Mr. Mukhtar said in a statement. A senior Pakistani military official said the army wanted to “bring home the point that the missile strikes are counterproductive, and that this is driving a wedge between the government and the tribal people.” Pakistani officials have consistently complained about the airstrikes that have been aimed at Arab fighters and Pakistani militants connected to Al Qaeda. But the statements against the airstrikes have been couched in less dramatic language than General Kayani’s declaration after an American ground raid in September in which he said Pakistan would defend its borders at “all costs.” There have been no known ground raids in the tribal areas since. On a more positive note, the senior Pakistani military official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject, said the United States had started “listening to us” and had moved toward sealing the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan in the Bajaur area. The Pakistani Army is fighting Taliban militants in Bajaur and has criticized the United States for what it says is the failure of American troops in Afghanistan to stop Afghan militants from crossing into Bajaur and joining the battle. The Americans moved some of their forces to the east of the Kunar River last week, and this helped curb the flow of militants into Bajaur, the Pakistani military official said. “It is bearing positive results,” he said. In an effort to show General Petraeus the hard terrain that the Pakistani forces face against the insurgents in the tribal areas, the military planned to fly him over some of the terrain on Tuesday, the military official said. That way, the general would get an idea of the long, porous border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. “We will let him see where the roads end and where the mountains start,” the official said. “It will be a glimpse of the Tora Bora from the other side,” he said, referring to the area in Afghanistan near the Pakistani border from where Osama bin Laden is believed to have escaped from American troops in late 2001. In a visit Tuesday to Peshawar, in the North-West Frontier Province, General Petraeus planned to meet with Maj. Gen. Tariq Khan, the new leader of the Frontier Corps, the paramilitary force that is fighting in Bajaur. After a long delay, American and British trainers began instructing Pakistani officers last month, who in turn will train the Frontier Corps in an effort to turn the paramilitary force into a more effective group of indigenous counterinsurgency fighters. The Pakistani military officials planned to ask General Petraeus for help in increasing the army’s “operational capabilities,” meaning equipment. But the army was reluctant to accept training. “Why should they get into our areas?” the senior military official asked.",

    "source": "Hillary Clinton Faces a More Liberal Democratic Fund-Raising Landscape <eos> Hillary Rodham Clinton will seek out donors to her presidential campaign from a Democratic fund-raising landscape vastly altered since her first presidential bid and far more ideologically aligned with the party’s liberal activists. Democrats now get far less money from Wall Street, military contractors, health care companies and other industries that for decades ladled out cash more evenly to both parties, according to a New York Times analysis of data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group. And the party now relies far more on constituencies that have achieved new clout in the era of “super PACs” and carefully targeted digital fund-raising. As many as one-fifth of elite Democratic “bundlers” — volunteers who raise money from friends and business associates — are active in gay-rights causes or are themselves gay or lesbian. Outside Democratic groups rely heavily on wealthy environmentalists, such as the billionaires Tom Steyer and Michael R. Bloomberg, and on labor unions, whose financial might has been magnified by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010 even as their membership rolls decline. Female donors and bundlers have become both a bigger source of funding and a more organized financial force in party affairs: Emily’s List, a political group dedicated to electing female Democrats, now has five times as many members and twice as many donors as it did when Mrs. Clinton ran for president in 2008. And Democrats now rely far more on grass-roots donors to be financially competitive with Republicans. Democratic Party committees raised $200 million from donors giving $200 or less in 2014, according to Federal Election Commission records, twice as much as in 2008. The shift in the party’s donor base is being driven, in part, by the same polarizing demographic and political trends that have made the Democratic Party more ideologically liberal and have aligned business more closely with Republicans. Industry Money Shifts to Republicans Over the last three election cycles, several major industries have shifted their political donations to Republicans from Democrats. “Historically, business was very pragmatic and played both sides,” said Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN, a left-leaning think tank with ties to business leaders in Washington. “Now, business had thrown its lot in with the Republicans. It means that the traditional arguments of business are losing their grip on Democrats, in part because business isn’t any longer investing in Democrats.” The transformation is already reflected in Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and speeches. She sided with House Democrats and labor unions during the intraparty battle over a new Pacific trade deal, risking a significant rupture with her former boss, President Obama . And she criticized “hedge fund managers” in her campaign kickoff event in New York City, the sort of rhetorical flourish she carefully avoided in the past. Her stump speech sharply attacks Republicans on issues that, Democratic strategists have learned, can loosen floods of money from grass-roots donors, such as reproductive rights, gay rights and equal pay for women. “She was always talking about these issues, but not with the same rhetoric,” said Howard Dean, the former Democratic Party chairman and governor of Vermont. “And that’s because her base has moved left and the country has moved the left. I think she can be more of who she is.” Mrs. Clinton’s rivals for the nomination are already benefiting from the shift. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist running for the Democratic nomination, is not yet the favored candidate of deep-pocketed Democratic donors. But he has already raised at least $8.3 million in online contributions through ActBlue , a fund-raising committee that serves as a conduit for Democratic campaigns. What Hillary Clinton Would Need to Do to Win Mrs. Clinton can expect little if any opposition in the Democratic primaries. But she was similarly well positioned when she declared her candidacy in 2007. At the same time, industries that wooed Democrats with a significant share of their political donations have steadily shifted more of their giving to Republicans, reflecting not only the country’s broader polarization but also years of bruising battles with the Obama administration and Democrats over issues like financial regulation, the Keystone XL oil pipeline and nutrition guidelines. Agribusiness and mining and oil interests, along with the financial services and health care industries, have shifted substantially more money to Republicans over the last three two-year election cycles, according to the Times analysis. That shift was exacerbated, some longtime Democratic fund-raisers said, by Mr. Obama’s decision not to accept contributions to his presidential campaigns from political action committees. While PACs account for a relatively small slice of money in presidential campaigns, their fund-raising historically acted as a bridge between Democratic politicians or lobbyists and businesses that were more Republican in outlook. “The fund-raising world in 2015 has changed dramatically from the fund-raising world in 2012 — which was a dramatic change from 2008,” said Representative Steve Israel, a New York Democrat and the former head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which now raises half its cash from small donors online. “It’s new rules, it’s new tools, it’s new technologies, and it’s new donors.” At the same time, older constituencies have become bigger players in Democratic fund-raising. More grass-roots fund-raising and bundling by groups like Emily’s List, for example, have created a financial constituency for issues such as equal pay. Who Is Running for President? Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention. “We’re not the full funders of any candidate,” said Stephanie Schriock , the president of Emily’s List and a close ally of Mrs. Clinton’s. “But we’re the extra bit that allows them more time to do what they need to do and the ability to speak on behalf of all women and families.” Stung by the defeat of Mr. Obama’s climate-change legislation in 2009, environmental groups have set up new bundler networks to raise “green-branded” dollars for candidates. They have also emerged as big spenders on election-themed political advertising. In 2014, the League of Conservation Voters and Mr. Steyer’s NextGen Climate Action, a super PAC, spent more on independent election advertising than any other Democratic-aligned issue groups. Climate change is also a top issue among the party’s super PAC donors, particularly Mr. Steyer. This month, Mr. Steyer issued a statement pointedly praising one of Mrs. Clinton’s Democratic rivals, Martin O’Malley , for “presenting real, concrete solutions to climate change.” For Mrs. Clinton, the party’s shifting financial fortunes may be a double-edged sword. They could liberate her to more forcefully or directly address issues that are important to the party’s base, especially on issues of wealth inequality, taxation and regulation. “What it does allow — and I think this is a particularly good thing in this year, when the biggest issue is fairness for working people — it does allow people to vote their consciences more easily,” Mr. Dean said. He added: “There’s no particular reason why Democrats even have to think about people on Wall Street. And they won’t.” But Mrs. Clinton’s campaign is particularly sensitive to criticisms that she is moving left or tailoring her message to the party’s liberal base. (A spokesman declined to comment for this article.) And there are signs that Mrs. Clinton, whose husband, former President Bill Clinton, became a successful fund-raiser by rebranding the Democrats as business-friendly, will seek more of an equilibrium. Unlike Mr. Obama, her campaign is aggressively raising money from business PACs, according to two Clinton fund-raisers. And Mrs. Clinton, like the Republicans who wish to run against her, has not yet pledged to voluntarily disclose the names of her bundlers. Mrs. Clinton’s most delicate dance may be with Wall Street. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs have for years been a source of personal, political and philanthropic wealth for the Clinton family. But the industry is now closely allied with Speaker John A. Boehner and congressional Republicans seeking to roll back or repeal elements of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms. Almost two-thirds of money from investment banks and three-quarters of donations from credit card companies and lenders now flow to Republicans, and donations from hedge fund and private equity executives were a significant source of cash for Republican super PACs during the 2012 election cycle. Mrs. Clinton backed the Dodd-Frank bill and other financial reforms, including elimination of the “carried interest” loophole used by private equity executives to lower their tax rate. But several Democratic donors and bundlers with Wall Street ties said they believed shewould be well positioned to repair that relationship; many financial executives, they said, viewed her more barbed language in recent weeks as necessary posturing. “The Clinton operation would like to have everybody in, and everybody giving,” said one longtime Clinton fund-raiser, who asked for anonymity so as not to damage his relationship with Mrs. Clinton’s team. “They usually try to find a way to have everyone on board.”",

    "source": "Restoring Sound to Windows 10 <eos> Q. I upgraded my PC laptop to Windows 10 and ever since my computer doesn’t have any sound. How do I get my audio back? A. Upgrading a computer from an older version of Windows can sometimes damage the system’s device drivers, including the one for the sound card. To grab a new copy of the driver software, go to the Start menu’s search box, enter Device Manager and open it when it pops up in the results list. Next, in the “Sound, video and game controllers” area, look for the name of your computer’s sound card. Depending on your model, you may see hardware from Creative Labs , Intel or another company listed. Click the Driver tab there and choose Update Driver. Windows should look around and install a new version of the driver. If the system reports that it cannot find a driver for your sound card, go to the support area of the company’s website and see if there is an updated driver there to download. Uninstalling the driver — and then having Windows 10 reinstall it for you — is another option. Go back to the Device Manager box, right-click the audio driver and choose Uninstall; if you have a touch-screen device, press and hold the driver to get the Uninstall option from the menu. Restart your computer, and Windows will try to reinstall it for you. If that maneuver fails as well, Microsoft suggests installing the generic High Definition Audio Device driver, which you can choose in the Device Manager when you use the Update Driver option. Instead of letting Windows look for the driver, choose the path that lets you search the computer and pick a driver from a list. Sound problems in Windows 10 are not uncommon, and Microsoft has prepared a page of resources that includes a series of video tutorials and troubleshooting tools . You can find it all at windows.microsoft.com/support . Speaking to Siri Q. I thought Siri on the iPhone was supposed to just answer if you said, “Hey Siri,” but I still have to press the button. Why? A. Siri , Apple’s virtual assistant software, will respond without you having to hold down the Home button — under certain conditions. If you do not have one of the newest models, (the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus), you need to have the phone plugged into a power source to summon Siri solely by voice. The “Hey Siri” option also needs to be enabled on your iPhone. To check in iOS 9, open the Settings icon on the Home screen. On the Settings screen, tap General, then Siri and flip the switch next to allow “Hey Siri.” After a short “Hey Siri” training session, you should be ready to go.

    "source": "A Voice That Stayed Above the Fray <eos> JOHANNESBURG — Bob Sheppard liked the air of mystery about his age. It was funny watching such a solid person, based in faith and education, grow a trifle coy about the year of his birth. But he was always specific about being born on Oct. 20. It was also Mickey Mantle’s birthday, but Bob did not live off that coincidence of two Yankees legends sharing a birthday. Bob had an ego, liked being the voice echoing around Yankee Stadium, saying, “No. 2, Derek Jee-tah,” but he did not need to be around the players. They did what they did out on the field, and he did what he did up on the booth. Here’s a little secret: between plays, Bob read books, hardcover books from home or the library. He was a voice, not a ballpark celebrity. How strange it is to be missing a chance to see Nelson Mandela, 91, circle the field in a golf cart in order to write about another man I admired, but from up close. Bob was more than 99 when he died Sunday after the illnesses that diminished him in the past few years. He was vague about them, too. I’ve known him since 1960, when I covered my first Yankee games as a young reporter. That summer, my wife and I, just married, would see him at Jones Beach strolling along the tide line with his wife, Mary. They were newlyweds, too; Bob’s first wife had died, but I did not know that at the time. They were a handsome couple. I reminded him of that recently, how I used to see him at the beach. He liked that, the memory of being a former St. John’s quarterback, tall, young and strolling the beach with his new wife. In recent years, when he was temporarily not going to Yankee Stadium — but definitely not retired — I would go see him; he was a little weaker each time. Recently I called, and he slowly let me know that he had fallen and was not going downstairs these days. He was as strong in his Roman Catholic faith as anybody I knew. He hated to admit he could no longer serve as a lector. His faith never wavered in the trying days. His daughter is a nun. He referred to Mary as “my archangel,” meaning she saved his life, day by day. Better to think of him younger, wearing tweedy professorial jackets, a note of class in the press dining room. He had his own little table in the corner at the old Yankee Stadium. The conversation went round and round, rarely about baseball. He did not need the reflected glory. The only time I would see him on the field was when he checked out the pronunciation of a new player’s name. In an earlier time, when baseball was not yet comfortable with Latino players, he made sure to give Minnie Miñoso his tilde. Later, he delighted in getting the pronunciation right for Shigetoshi Hasegawa . But he was not a fan. That is what people missed about Bob. He did not have gossip about players, insights into managers, theories about strategy. In the past few years, I would casually ask if he followed the Yankees or their broadcasters or even how his successors were doing with their own echoes in Yankee Stadium, and he seemed a bit vague. The last time I called, I noted that he had a special birthday coming up. It was the first time he had ever allowed me to refer, however obliquely, to his actual age. I don’t think he was anticipating a 100th birthday celebration. He was as secure about that as he was about everything else.",

Mark Proegler, a BP spokesman, said preparations continued for hooking a third vessel, the Helix Producer, up to the systems, which would increase the capture capacity from 28,000 barrels a day to 53,000 barrels. Skimming operations across the gulf have scooped up about 23.5 million gallons of oiled water so far. Oil Spotted in Lake Pontchartrain Oil sheen and tar balls from the spill have been spotted in Lake Pontchartrain, which forms the northern boundary of New Orleans and was rescued in the 1990s from rampant pollution, according to the unified command for the spill. Response crews placed a combined 600 feet of hard and soft boom in the Rigolets strait to prevent more oil from getting through to the lake. Nineteen manual skimming vessels and four decontamination vessels based out of Orleans and St. Tammany Parishes were dispatched to the oiled areas.

    "source": "Italian Technology Is Chrysler’s Hope for Revival <eos> Fiat quietly ended its effort to market cars in the United States a quarter-century ago when the last of its vehicles to carry the Fiat nameplate, the 1983 Brava sedan, drove off a dealer lot. They had stylish exteriors and responsive handling, but Fiats were notoriously unreliable. This time around, the Italian automaker is hoping to make a more favorable and lasting impression on American consumers, with much-improved, fuel-efficient cars that could roll off the assembly lines of its new partner, Chrysler , in as little as 18 months. Fiat technology — which President Obama praised on Thursday at a news conference at the White House — will go into new Chryslers, broadening Chrysler’s lineup to include small and midsize cars. At the same time, the Fiat Group will introduce a few of its own cars, including Alfa Romeos, that are available only in Europe now. It is a remarkable turnabout for Fiat, which has ridden a wild roller coaster of successes and failures throughout its history, just as its new partner, Chrysler, has. Fiat withdrew from the United States in the 1980s — its Alfa Romeo franchise hung on for another decade until it too gave up — after drivers nicknamed the company Fix It Again Tony because its cars seemed to spend more time at the garage than on the highway. “The cars now are a world away from what they sold in the 1970s, or even six or seven years ago,” said Garel Rhys, head of the Center for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University in Wales. Fiat was among the last of the big auto companies to join what Mr. Rhys calls “the quality revolution,” finally focusing on quality after Sergio Marchionne became chief executive in 2004. Mr. Marchionne spearheaded the deal for Chrysler and is also exploring a bid for the European and Latin American operations of General Motors. Now both Fiat and Alfa Romeo will return to showrooms among Chrysler’s United States dealerships, but drivers who remember Fiat’s boxy styles from the 1970s won’t recognize today’s models. The first Fiat car to arrive will be the 500, known as the Cinquecento, an update of the Italian classic from the 1960s that has earned comparisons to the more expensive Mini Cooper and has been a big hit since its introduction in Europe two years ago. Before that happens, the new Fiat Group offerings will have to be re-engineered to conform to United States crash-test standards. With the 500, Fiat hopes to attract younger, urban drivers, and it plans to sell it in Chrysler dealerships on both coasts beginning in 2011, manufacturing it at Chrysler factories in Mexico. In Europe, the Fiat 500 sells for roughly 9,000 euros, or $12,000, on average. The Mini, made by BMW, sells on average for $25,600 in the United States. Alfa Romeo will return with the MiTo, a compact now on sale in Europe, and the Milano, reviving a name from the 1980s and 1990s. When Chrysler emerges from bankruptcy, Fiat will initially have a 20 percent stake in the company, as well as three seats on the new company’s nine-member board. In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Marchionne said, “We look forward to delivering on the vast potential this alliance holds and reintroducing to North American customers some of our most popular brands.” But Fiat executives say the first priority will be building and selling the Chrysler models with Fiat technology. “Selling Fiats won’t turn Chrysler around,” said one executive who insisted on anonymity because of Fiat company policy. “You’re going to see a new range of Chrysler cars, based on our engineering, our platforms and our engines with a shape exclusively their own.” The midsize Chrysler Sebring, made in Sterling Heights, Mich., is among the models that Fiat engineers will redesign using technology from the Milano. Fiat also sees opportunities in selling Chrysler’s Jeep brand in markets like Brazil, Russia and India, along with Dodge Ram trucks. Fiat does not produce full-size S.U.V.’s or one-ton trucks, so American-made Jeeps and Dodge trucks could be a valuable addition to its product line if fuel prices remain low and global demand for bigger vehicles rebounds. Still, the return of Fiats to the United States, as well as new Chryslers built around Fiat technology, poses a marketing challenge. Despite praise for Fiat’s technological prowess and its fuel-efficient cars from the likes of President Obama, “nobody below 40 knows what on earth this vehicle is,” Mr. Rhys said. “It’s almost a new entry in the car market.” Fiat officials say that’s an exaggeration, adding that Fiat opened its first showroom in New York in 1904, five years after the company was founded in Turin. It also opened an assembly plant in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., before World War I. And CNH, its farm equipment division that sells the brands Case and New Holland, has long been a major player in the American agricultural market, with headquarters in Chicago. The Fiat Group’s ultra-high-end sports cars, Maserati and Ferrari, are available in the United States, as well. “It’s not like we’re arriving at Ellis Island,” said Richard Gadeselli, a Fiat spokesman. Alfa Romeo, he added, “still has a huge reservoir of brand loyalty. The U.S. has the largest number of Alfa Romeo owners’ clubs in the world.” Then again, some older drivers may remember Fiat for its quality problems, thinking of it in the same light as other failed European offerings, like Renault’s Le Car and the Yugo. “It’s a giant challenge,” said John Casesa of the Casesa Shapiro Group, an independent auto advisory firm in New York. “It will be very difficult to sell older, domestically oriented buyers on Fiat. They don’t buy small cars and don’t have good memories of Fiat’s last foray into the U.S.” Even the Chrysler models with the latest Fiat technology could face skepticism, Mr. Casesa added, saying that when it comes to reliability, drivers’ perceptions can take years, even decades to evolve. He says the Pontiac Vibe made by G.M. is virtually identical to the Toyota Matrix, but lags far behind in sales, despite G.M.’s improved quality over the last 25 years. “Fiat has a lot to overcome,” he said. “They will have to be patient to win people over.”",

    "source": "From Woods: Moony Eyes, Lilting Voice, Then a Bombshell <eos> The golfers lamenting Tiger Woods ’s indefinite leave from the PGA Tour because he is their cash cow are out of bounds. Only two people are truly dependent on Woods, and earlier this year, he could not stop smiling when he talked about them. His 2-year-old daughter, Sam, and 10-month-old son, Charlie, brought out Woods’s softer side in interviews. When I covered Woods early in his career, the only warmth he exuded in news conferences came from the vibrant reds of his signature Sunday shirts. This year was different. Returning to competitive golf in late February after a nine-month injury-induced absence, Woods drew me in with a smile that started in his eyes when he talked about his children. When he was asked about the birth of Charlie or how he occupied himself while recovering from knee surgery, his eyes grew moony and his voice was lilting — a marked departure from his monotone. He talked about cutting practice short to spend time with Charlie. He expressed delight in the rapid development of Sam. “I didn’t realize how much I loved being home,” he said. This melting glacier of a golfer was so much more interesting, and likable, than the ice man who had won 14 major titles. Woods’s global warming required further examination, so I tracked him around the course in a kind of scavenger hunt in the first months of his six-win campaign. I was searching for more clues to flesh out the Clark Kent alter ego of golf’s Superman, and I collected enough material to write two articles. After a late-night accident last month and Woods’s subsequent admission of infidelity, the headlines of those articles read like punch lines: “The Family Guy Is Back on the Course” and “All Eyes Are on Tiger, the Father.” Woods’s parenting role model was his father, Earl, who was committed to rearing him after having two sons and a daughter in a failed first marriage. Earl, a retired Army officer, attributed the divorce to military obligations that took him away from the family. Asked how he would manage to be there for his children when golf takes him away from home so much, Woods told me, “It’s going to be a lot more difficult, there’s no doubt.” Maybe it is impossible. Perhaps Woods was destined to be like his father, only not in the way he had hoped. Over lunch on the veranda at the Masters one year, Earl Woods said, “I’ve told Tiger that marriage is unnecessary in a mobile society like ours.” The way Woods talked about his children, I was sure he was going to prove his father wrong.",

City officials acknowledged that some families were turned away from its main intake center in the Bronx but said they were unable to provide specific numbers. The families were turned down in accordance with a new policy that forbids them from being granted last-minute emergency shelter if they have been ruled ineligible for benefits. In the past, families who were initially denied a place to stay could still get emergency shelter if they reapplied after 5 p.m. But the city stopped allowing that because it said the loophole was being abused by a small number of families. Last night, some homeless families who had received notices that they would be denied shelter nonetheless showed up at the intake center. Most were provided beds. “People working inside the shelter told me that because of the media attention, people are getting placed,” said Patrick Markee, a representative of the Coalition for the Homeless. But at least two families were not. One family was headed by Don Keith Allen, 40, who said he had been seeking emergency housing since Sept. 6, showed up with his sons — John Keith Allen Jr., 11, and John Keith Hamilton, 20 — and was turned away. Outside the shelter, a group of nuns from nearby St. Ann’s Episcopal Church showed up to help. They offered Mr. Allen and his sons a place to sleep for the night, and they accepted.",

    "source": "Cash-Rich, Publicity-Shy, Abu Dhabi Fund Draws Scrutiny <eos> Abu Dhabi has about 9 percent of the world’s oil and 0.02 percent of its population. The result is a surfeit of petrodollars, much of which is funneled into a secretive, government-controlled investment fund that is helping to shift the balance of power in the financial world. After decades in the shadows, the fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, is turning heads on Wall Street and in Washington by making high-profile investments in the United States and elsewhere. Known as ADIA (pronounced ah-DEE-ah), the fund recently formed a small team that is now buying big stakes in Western companies. This unit masterminded ADIA’s $7.5 billion investment in Citigroup , the nation’s largest bank, in November. It has also taken a large position in Toll Brothers, one of the country’s biggest home builders. “There is an idea that Abu Dhabi should not be the underdog of the map,” said Frauke Heard-Bey, a historian who has written a book about the political emergence of the United Arab Emirates. “They have the money to buy companies that are ailing, and why should they not? Why not make a mark?” ADIA is the largest of the world’s sovereign wealth funds , giant pools of money controlled by cash-rich governments, particularly in Asia and Middle East. But Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the seven Arab emirates, says little about its fund. Few outsiders know for sure where ADIA invests — or even how much money it controls. And secrecy breeds hyperbole; some estimates of the fund’s size surpass $1 trillion. Before long, ADIA will certainly reach that mark. But for now bankers, former employees and analysts familiar with the fund peg it at $650 billion to $700 billion — an amount that is still over 15 times the size of the Fidelity Magellan Fund. In all, sovereign wealth funds in countries like the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Singapore, China and Russia control more than $2 trillion, a figure that could approach $12 trillion by 2015, analysts say. Such riches, coupled with the more aggressive stance being taken by ADIA and other sovereign funds, has raised concern that these investors will wield their wealth for political as well as financial reasons. ADIA’s secrecy is also drawing scrutiny. The fund has no internal communications department, although it says it is in the process of setting one up. When sovereign fund leaders from around the world descended on Davos, Switzerland, last month for the World Economic Forum, no one from ADIA saw fit to show up. Executives at ADIA declined to comment for this article. Last week Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on security and international trade and finance, who has raised concerns about sovereign fund transparency, traveled to Abu Dhabi to meet with senior ADIA executives. Also last week, a delegation led by Clay Lowery, a top Treasury official, met with ADIA executives as part of a move to formalize investment guidelines for sovereign funds. In many ways the tension between ADIA’s elephantine size — the fund is twice as big as Norway’s, the second-largest sovereign fund — and its demure aspect is underscored by its investment in Citigroup. Since ADIA’s genesis in 1976, the fund has followed a conservative investment approach. It has farmed out its assets to foreign money managers and taken stakes in companies based upon their weighting in benchmark stock indexes like the Standard & Poor’s 500. ADIA is also one of the largest institutional investors in hedge funds and private equity funds. This approach has served ADIA well and reflects the strongly felt notion that the fund’s ultimate purpose is to serve as a financial reserve for Abu Dhabi in times when oil revenues are less robust. Nevertheless, guided by the advice of a stream of foreign bankers who worked at ADIA in the 1970s and 1980s, the fund has allocated a large portion of its assets to equities. It now has about 65 percent of assets, or about $450 billion, invested in stocks, according to bankers. Currently, the fund averages a yearly return of 10 to 20 percent, say people who have been briefed on the fund’s investment strategy. With oil about $100 a barrel, bankers and analysts estimate Abu Dhabi produces a surplus of at least $50 billion a year. Given the emirate’s small population, 80 percent of which is foreign born, even the most expansive investment and welfare policies make it hard to put a dent in such a sum. The United States is not a big buyer of Abu Dhabi’s oil, most of which goes to Asia, but the surplus is a vivid reminder of the American economy’s own fiscal imbalance, to say nothing of its diminishing global stature, a theme that underpins much of the political worry surrounding sovereign fund investments. “In the short run, that they are investing here is good,” Senator Bayh said. “But in the long run it is unsustainable. Our power and authority is eroding because of the amounts we are sending abroad for energy and consumer goods.” In the past, much of Abu Dhabi’s cash surplus has gone to ADIA, although the formation two years ago of a smaller sister fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, has resulted in a lesser amount flowing to ADIA, analysts say. But ADIA’s new strategic investment group represents the clearest sign that the fund is taking steps to leverage its size and influence. The division was set up in the summer of 2006 and is overseen by Saeed Mubarek Rashid al-Hajiri, a young Western-educated portfolio manager who also heads the fund’s considerable investments in emerging market economies. In addition to Citigroup and Toll Brothers, in which ADIA took a 4.5 percent position last summer, other companies in the group’s portfolio include EFG Hermes, one of the leading investment banks in the Arab world, and Banque de Tunisie et des Emirats, a Tunisian bank. Instead of passively tracking indexes, this unit actively picks investments in hopes of generating market-beating returns. It is a method of stock picking practiced by most hedge funds and asset management companies, and the Citigroup investment, with its size and attendant risk, is a good example of this approach. Compared with the overall fund, the assets within this group are small at about $30 billion, according to people who have been briefed on ADIA’s strategy. As with all its investments, ADIA adopts a long-term, passive approach and does not seek board seats. These people say that outsiders still manage 80 percent of ADIA’s assets, proof that the fund’s commitment to making direct investments is only in its early stages. This hesitation partly reflects the lack of a strong individual within the organization who has the combination of investment experience, trust of the royal family and a bit of international swagger to assume a larger public presence. The fund’s chairman is Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates and the ruler of Abu Dhabi. He has a cautious and reserved disposition and does not take an active role in ADIA. When Citigroup’s chairman, Robert E. Rubin, traveled to Abu Dhabi last November, his courtesy call was made to Sheik Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, crown prince of Abu Dhabi and the point person for the United States-Abu Dhabi relationship. The fund’s managing director is Sheik Ahmed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a half-brother of Sheik Khalifa who maintains a full-floor office in ADIA’s sleek 40-story headquarters. People familiar with ADIA management, however, say the sheik, who has worked at ADIA for 10 years, delegates significant authority to Jean-Paul Villain, a publicity-shy French money manager who directs investment strategy and asset allocation. Mr. Villain, the most senior foreign-born executive at the fund, joined ADIA in the early 1980s from the French bank Paribas. While other expatriates have come and gone, Mr. Villain has stayed, except for a brief period in the mid-1980s. More so than the other foreigners, Mr. Villain, whose wife is Syrian-born, has gained the royal family’s trust. One view is that ADIA’s penchant for secrecy stems from its experience during the scandal at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in the early 1990s, during which ADIA is said to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars. The al-Nahyan family became embroiled in regulatory investigations, although no charges were ever brought against them. But people who worked at ADIA from its earliest days in the late 1970s and 1980s say that the fund’s reticence dates to its formation. Some see this as a reflection of Abu Dhabi’s small size, insular culture and geographical vulnerability, a sense that the less that is known about the specifics of ADIA’s hoard, the better. “ADIA does not answer to a wide public at home,” said David L. Mack, a former United States ambassador to the United Arab Emirates. “They are a small country in an area with some nasty countries like Iran that can make trouble for them. They don’t like to advertise.”",

    "source": "Gov. Bob Riley of Alabama Calls for Ethics Overhaul <eos> Less than two months after a federal corruption investigation led to the arrest of four state senators, Gov. Bob Riley of Alabama announced Wednesday that he was calling a special session of the Legislature this month and urged lawmakers to pass an aggressive ethics overhaul package. The proposal that the governor unveiled would address several loopholes in state ethics laws, some of which are at the root of recent corruption indictments. “The opportunity to enact real reforms has never been better, and the need has never been greater,” the governor said in a statement. Mr. Riley, a Republican who will leave office in January and is prevented by term limits from running again, called for the special session to begin next Wednesday. Efforts at an ethics overhaul have for the most part faltered in Alabama since the nationwide wave of state ethics initiatives that followed the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. Some rules were strengthened in the mid-1990s, but large gaps have remained. “I think it’s just been institutional resistance,” said James L. Sumner, the director of the Alabama Ethics Commission. “You could never actually single out a person or a group that was opposed to ethics reform. It was essentially death by a thousand cuts.” Law enforcement has stepped in where ethics rules fell short. One governor, Guy Hunt, resigned after a felony conviction on charges that included theft. Another, Don Siegelman, is appealing a bribery conviction. Two wide-ranging federal corruption investigations in the last few years have led to the arrest, conviction or guilty pleas of numerous state officials. As recently as October, 11 people were arrested, including four lawmakers and three lobbyists, on charges related to what the authorities called a scheme by casino operators to buy votes for legislation favorable to gambling. This drumbeat of scandal has made the prospects for a substantial ethics overhaul as good as they have been in years. The state government is also firmly in the control of the Republicans for the first time in more than a century, giving the party’s legislators an incentive to act on a broadly popular issue. The most significant proposal in the ethics package, in Mr. Sumner’s estimation, involves the state’s campaign finance laws, which have gained a national reputation for looseness due largely to the presence of so-called P.A.C.-to-P.A.C. transfers. Currently, a donation to one political action committee can be bundled with other donations and given to another committee, and then to another, a process that essentially launders campaign donations and renders their origins untraceable. The ethics package would ban such transfers. Other proposals are aimed at curtailing the influence of lobbyists, one of the core issues of the federal vote-buying inquiry. Currently, lobbyists, or anyone for that matter, can more or less spend as much as they want on hospitality, meals, travel, tickets and other gifts for public officials. Spending that adds up to less than $250 a day does not even have to be disclosed. The proposed overhaul would, with some exceptions, put a $25 limit on gifts to a public official on any one occasion, and a $100 limit on gifts to an official from one source per year. All spending would have to be disclosed. The package would also give the state ethics commission the power of subpoena for the first time, a shortcoming that has severely hampered state ethics inquiries, leaving investigators dependent on local district attorneys who were often themselves politically compromised.",

    "source": "Making a Leap to the Big Time, Ready or Not <eos> Just before the start of the second half of a game late last month between the New Jersey Institute of Technology and visiting Bloomfield College, the N.J.I.T. cheerleading squad broke a huddle -- and walked out of the gymnasium. The sudden departure of team spirit was not lost upon Jim Casciano, the men's basketball coach at N.J.I.T., a university in Newark with an undergraduate enrollment of 5,366, give or take a dozen cheerleaders. \"Where are the cheerleaders going?\" Casciano said to Tim Camp, the assistant athletic director. \"Did someone tell them that the game was over?\" All Camp could do was smile and shrug his shoulders. \"Sorry, Coach,\" he said. \"I guess it's another kink in the system that we need to straighten out.\" Casciano and his Highlanders, an N.C.A.A. Division II squad playing in the Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference, had better get the kinks out soon. Next season, they will begin playing in Division I as an independent. Ready or not, here come St. John's, Richmond, Columbia and Lafayette, four teams tentatively scheduled for N.J.I.T.'s first tour at college athletics' highest level. \"Going into Division I is a great opportunity for us,\" said Casciano, a head coach for 20 seasons. \"I just hope that people understand that what they see next year is not a finished product, but a process that is going to take some time to complete.\" During the Bloomfield game, there were signs everywhere that the process, which includes everything from improving N.J.I.T.'s on-court talent to creating a big-time atmosphere at the mom-and-pop Fleisher Athletic Center, would indeed take time. The Highlanders have no player taller than Henry White, a 6-foot-7 senior who plays forward and center. Dan Stonkus, a 6-9, 240-pound freshman, is being redshirted. But the Highlanders (7-15) may not currently have the speed and the two-way tenacity to compete in Division I. Clayton Barker is a 5-10 junior point guard with good court vision, a dependable pull-up jumper and stutter-step moves to the basket. He is averaging 20.6 points a game, but he is N.J.I.T.'s only consistent scoring threat. \"Next year's schedule is our recruiting tool,\" said Casciano, sitting behind his desk in a dark suit and a matching mood after his team lost to Bloomfield, 81-75. \"Right now, we're recruiting legitimate Division I players, although we do not have a lot to sell them other than having a chance to be a part of something special, to maybe get some good playing time against some of the best competition in the country, and of course, to benefit from playing at an excellent academic school.\" In addition to adding talent, N.J.I.T. will have to begin shedding the rest of its Division II wardrobe. The game against Bloomfield drew about 150 fans -- about the capacity of two busloads of Syracuse fans. The bleachers were built to accommodate about 1,000 spectators. Barker, from Passaic High School in New Jersey, said that playing before large crowds on the road next season would not be an easy adjustment. \"Executing our game plan with thousands of people screaming at us is going to be a tall order, but it's an exciting transition that we are all looking forward to,\" he said. \"Personally, I feel blessed that this has happened to us.\" N.J.I.T. has a lot of work to do before it happens. The team's public-address system is a laptop computer that pumps songs through a single speaker hanging on a wall behind the scorer's table. There is no news media room, because there is no news media coverage, and no television timeouts, because there is no television contract. But if a university filled with future architects and engineers cannot figure out a way to design and build a winning basketball program, who can? Lenny Kaplan, the athletic director, said there would be a big increase in the budget, \"probably fourfold.\" \"At the Division II level, everything is regionally based, but in Division I, recruiting and travel is done nationally, and that becomes a lot more expensive,\" he said. Kaplan added that N.J.I.T. had raised $2.5 million in a $5 million fund-raising campaign to offset the costs of moving to Division I. Robert A. Altenkirch, the N.J.I.T. president, said: \"Our first objective for next season is to be able to play an opponent at the Division I level and not come away from the game feeling embarrassed. If we can just hang in there for minutes at a time and not pay attention to wins and losses, that would be pretty good, and maybe, over the course of three or four years, we might begin to see some improvement.\" The N.J.I.T. men's soccer team began playing in Division I in 2004. By the fall, all of the university's sports teams -- N.J.I.T. does not have a football program -- will be competing in Division I. \"This is all about visibility,\" Altenkirch said when asked why N.J.I.T. applied to the National Collegiate Athletic Association for reclassification to Division I. \"We are a nationally ranked research university, so why not line up with some of our peers and be a nationally recognized athletic program?\" Altenkirch said that N.J.I.T. had been in discussions with the Devils about the possibility of playing host to basketball games against major Division I opponents at the Devils' new hockey arena, which is being built along Newark's waterfront and is scheduled to open in the fall of 2007. Altenkirch said that after this season, N.J.I.T. would install a new court at the Fleisher Athletic Center and increase the seating capacity to at least 2,000. \"If you think about Newark, and the renaissance that is going on here, well, the city deserves a Division I basketball program,\" he said. \"And we're the only game in town.\"",

    "source": "Latvia Stands By Its Currency Peg <eos> PARIS — Latvia, the European Union member country worst hit by the economic crisis, sought Thursday to convince investors that it would stand by its currency peg as speculation of a devaluation mounted and the country awaited additional aid. In December, the European Union, the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the Nordic countries backed Latvia’s recovery policies with financing worth 7.5 billion euros ($10.6 billion). The I.M.F. agreed to put up 1.7 billion euros of that total, while the European Union offered 3.1 billion euros. But the disbursal of the latest installment of 1 billion euros has been held up as the Latvian government seeks to carry out painful cuts in public sector wages. European Union and I.M.F. officials are in Riga, the capital, to discuss it. Fears of a crisis rose Wednesday after Latvia was unable to sell short-term debt and the currency strained the lower end of the band in which the Latvian central bank allows it to trade against the euro . Investors who expected a devaluation would be unlikely to buy debt denominated in the national currency, the lat. One euro currently trades at about 1.41 lats. The band was set in anticipation of the country’s joining the euro zone, which is expected in 2012 at the earliest. “A breakdown in the relationship with the I.M.F. and E.U. would leave Latvia facing a substantial budget and external financing gap,” Fitch Ratings said Thursday in a report, adding that “such a situation would be likely to precipitate a devaluation of the lat.” Martins Gravitis, a spokesman for the central bank, said Latvia was committed to the peg “until the lat is replaced by the euro.” Latvia, a Baltic country of 2.2 million people, had a gross domestic product of about $34 billion last year. But output plunged in the first quarter and was expected to contract by about 17 percent for the year. The government is struggling to reduce its budget deficit, which is estimated at about 9.2 percent of gross domestic product. The I.M.F. had agreed to a revised budget deficit of 7 percent from the original 5 percent, and meeting the current target would not be possible without further budget cuts. Mr. Gravitis said public sector salaries would have to fall about 30 percent, returning them to 2006-7 levels, to make the budget. The private sector, he said, would find its own equilibrium. In Washington, Caroline Atkinson, a spokeswoman for the I.M.F., said at a news briefing that the situation in Latvia was “challenging,” and that “the authorities have stressed the importance of controlling the government debt and deficits and maintaining the peg.” Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis must tread a fine line, balancing international lenders’ demands with the knowledge that poverty is increasing and social unrest is rising. Riots in January brought down his predecessor. Latvians go to the polls this weekend for municipal elections, and officials said political concerns might have affected the timing of the government’s new budget announcements.",

    "source": "Yankees to Debate on Future of Torre <eos> In his news conference late Monday night, Joe Torre tried to dissect another Yankees playoff loss and explain what it meant for his future. Watching on a television in the manager’s office as Torre choked up, the coaches struggled with what they were seeing. “Joe treats everybody with respect, whether you’re a batboy, a coach or a trainer,” said Larry Bowa, the third-base coach. “He does everything the right way. What he has to go through, after all that he’s done, it doesn’t seem right. But we’ve all been in baseball for a long time. That’s the process.” The painful process of parting with a manager was enough to make Bowa and the others teary on Monday. A day later, as the coaches and some players packed up their lockers at Yankee Stadium, Torre was a no-show and George Steinbrenner , the principal owner, was silent. His only statement came through his publicist, Howard Rubenstein, who said Steinbrenner was flying home to Tampa, Fla., and had nothing to say for now. Steinbrenner will seek opinions on whether to offer Torre a new contract, but his public decree before Game 3 of the division series — that Torre would lose his job if the Yankees lost the series to Cleveland — resonates. If Steinbrenner lets Torre go, as expected, most people around the team believe the front-runner to succeed him is the bench coach, Don Mattingly . Others believe Joe Girardi has a chance, and Tony La Russa — like Lou Piniella last year — is the biggest name on the managerial free-agent market. Mattingly yesterday would not directly address whether he would want Torre’s job, but he said he had always made it clear that he would like a chance to manage. Yet he knows that replacing Torre, his close friend who won four World Series, would be an extraordinary challenge. “I would think it’s like following John Wooden or somebody,” Mattingly said yesterday. “The guy’s won championship after championship, and he’s in the playoffs every year. It’s pretty much a no-win situation for someone to come in here and be able to experience what he’s done. It’s not going to happen. So as far as coming in here and taking on that job, it’s not necessarily a great situation.” Girardi was Torre’s bench coach in 2005 before taking over the Florida Marlins and winning the National League Manager of the Year award. He clashed with management and was fired, but he is still widely respected, especially by General Manager Brian Cashman. When Steinbrenner wanted to fire Torre last fall, Cashman interceded and saved Torre’s job. Torre had a year remaining on his contract then, but the deal is up now, and Cashman would not say if he would still recommend Torre. “I’m not going to comment, in fairness to the process, until I have a chance to sit down with ownership,” Cashman said yesterday, adding later of Steinbrenner: “He’s always picked the manager here. Obviously, I had a great deal of input in last year’s process, so we’ll see. You can’t get ahead of the process.” The Yankees are planning their annual organizational meetings, and before he left for Tampa, Steinbrenner’s son Hank, a senior vice president, told The Associated Press that no decisions had been made. “I really do like Joe a lot,” he said. “I have a lot of admiration for him.” Torre stayed at his home in Westchester County yesterday, speaking by phone with Cashman, Mattingly and others. Torre contacted the Yankees’ media relations director, Jason Zillo, because photographers were camped on his lawn, even though he had pleaded for privacy in his news conference. The idea of La Russa replacing Torre would seem to appeal more to the vintage Steinbrenner, who craved the biggest name, than the Steinbrenner of today. La Russa’s contract with the St. Louis Cardinals is also expiring, and the Cardinals are without a general manager. “You know how rumors are; anyone can start one,” said outfielder Shelley Duncan, whose father, Dave, is La Russa’s pitching coach. “Even my dad would tell you there is nothing substantial until action starts to take place. None of that has happened. Joe is our manager.” Steinbrenner, 77, has a warm spot for ex-Yankees and has always held Mattingly, a former Yankees captain, in high regard. Four years ago, he called Mattingly at his farm in Evansville, Ind., making a personal appeal for him to coach the Yankees’ hitters after eight years of retirement. When Mattingly was given the bench coach job last October, after Lee Mazzilli was dismissed, he was seen as the clear heir to Torre. Players believe Mattingly would have a similar style. “He’s got a great baseball mind,” first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz said. “He and Joe were both great players. Sometimes you lose how hard this game really is, but Joe and Donnie didn’t lose that. Usually, the longer it is since you played, the better player you were and the easier the game was to you. But with those guys, they never make you feel like they’re talking down to you.” Mientkiewicz and the other players who showed up yesterday expressed support for Torre, praising him for steering the Yankees to the postseason after a 21-29 start. Mientkiewicz revealed that Torre “let us have it” during a team meeting in Toronto in May, just before the turnaround began, and another first baseman, Andy Phillips, said he could not contemplate the Yankees without Torre. “I refuse to think that way right now,” Phillips said. “I won’t let that thought enter into my mind.” Most important, of course, is how seriously that thought is bouncing around the brain of Steinbrenner, who must decide — officially — whether to part with the most popular and successful manager he has had. “His reign so far here has been terrific,” Cashman said of Torre. “You’d sign up for it right now, if you could find that. It’s been magical and it’s been incredible through ’07. What goes on going forward, in ’08 and beyond, is the discussion topic on the table.”",

    "source": "Marketers Chase Evolving Consumer <eos> PHOENIX — THE senior executives who spoke at a major marketing conference here seemed to be auditioning for a reality show called “Extreme Makeover: Corporate Edition.” The executives, appearing during the annual conference of the Association of National Advertisers , urged their peers to recognize that the pace and scope of technological and societal changes — described as “crazy” in two presentations — required what one speaker called a “constant reinvention” of marketing. The stakes are high enough, some suggested, that the need to make over marketing may be a matter of life and death — at least, perhaps, when it comes to careers. “You either innovate or die,” said Roger Adams, the chief marketing officer at the United Services Automobile Association. John Costello, the president for global marketing and innovation at the Dunkin’ Brands Group, advocated providing consumers with “a real clear point of product differentiation” by declaring, “Differentiate or die.” And Stephen Quinn, the executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the Walmart U.S. division of Wal-Mart Stores, held up a copy of the current issue of ANA Magazine, which depicts on its cover a chameleon beside the headline, “Change or Die.” “We as marketers have never had to face this before,” Mr. Quinn said, particularly against a backdrop of “an economy that’s not that great.” Marketers must acknowledge they are operating in “a new era, a customer era,” he added, one in which “the consumer is in control” and decides what hits or misses. He referred to the huge popularity of the South Korean singer Psy — “There is not a marketer in this room good enough to engineer this” — and the TV series “ Duck Dynasty ” — “We sell hundreds of millions of dollars of ‘Duck Dynasty’ merchandise.” “This is a painful transition for us,” Mr. Quinn said, “but it is going to make everyone in this room customer-centric.” Joseph V. Tripodi, the executive vice president and chief marketing and commercial officer at the Coca-Cola Company, discussed how risk-taking must become second nature, citing the “big, hairy, audacious goal” his company adopted in 2010, under the rubric of Vision 2020 , to more than double revenue in a decade. Among other recent risky business decisions, Mr. Tripodi listed the introduction in Argentina of a soft drink named Coca-Cola Life , which mixes sugar and stevia and is sold in a recyclable bottle, made with plant material, bearing a green label rather than the Coke brand’s familiar red one. “It’s like playing with the crown jewels,” he said, “but we’re encouraged by the results early on.” Image “We talk around the world, ‘We need to be bold, be disruptive,’ ” said Joseph V. Tripodi, the marketing chief for Coca-Cola. Credit Kevin Keelan/Clarion Pictures With so many consumers engaging with companies, and one another, through social media sites like Facebook, Tumblr and Twitter, marketers should consider “provocations,” which generate responses that are “shared broadly,” Mr. Tripodi said. “We talk around the world, ‘We need to be bold, be disruptive,’ ” he added, offering as examples an effort that encouraged Indians and Pakistanis to connect with one another through interactive Coca-Cola Small World vending machines and a commercial that explained why the company sponsored sporting events like the Olympics. Beth Comstock, the senior vice president and chief marketing officer at the General Electric Company, took a long-term perspective — portraying Thomas A. Edison, a founder of G.E., as “the Steve Jobs of his day” — in offering “some lessons learned as we try to navigate the change.” “Know yourself,” she advised, adding: “At G.E., we’re not going to be Facebook. We’re not going to be Apple. We’re pretty cool with what we are.” And what is that? “We have embraced our geeky side,” Ms. Comstock said. “We’re geeky, and we’re proud of it.” She provided examples of how “sci fi goes to sci real” in social media that include Facebook , Instagram, Tumblr, Vine and YouTube through initiatives with names like “ Datalandia, the small town saved by Big Data ,” “factory flyovers,” “140 things we made today” and “ six-second science fairs .” Mr. Costello of Dunkin’ Brands warned that “in the crazy, ever-changing world we face,” where “marketing has become very, very complicated,” it has become “easy to get caught up in trying to do everything.” Rather, it is important to “confront reality,” he said, adding, “Marketers tend to be optimists, but you know, hope is not a strategy.” For Dunkin’ Donuts stores, Mr. Costello said, a decision was made to promote differentiation with a campaign, “ America runs on Dunkin’ , ” that presents the brand’s coffee products as “how everyday folks who keep America running keep themselves running every day.” Although “ ‘ Time to make the donuts ’ was an iconic campaign” for Dunkin’ Donuts for decades, Mr. Costello said, executives realized that “coffee was the future.” And reflecting how “change has become the norm,” he added, the company plans to introduce new commercials on Monday with a social-media focus. The spots end with consumers proclaiming, “Hashtag my Dunkin’,” which appears on screen, in Twitter-friendly fashion, as “#mydunkin.” The conference, which began Thursday and ended on Sunday, drew a record attendance estimated at close to 2,200; the previous record, set last year , was about 1,850.",

    "source": "The Mystery of the Umbrellas <eos> THE first time it happens, the neophyte will probably think it’s an aberration, maybe one oddball’s bizarre pathology. Then there will be another, and another, and it turns out everyone’s doing it. What a funny bunch, these New Yorkers. Autumn has faded, the cold has descended, and then the first snowfall of the year arrives. The flakes start falling, and to the transplant from the snowy provinces, they will be a nostalgic reminder of home. Ah, the snow! So lovely, and what a hush and lulling contrast to the usual hustle and bustle. Then the transplant sees that first person walking down the street nonchalantly holding an umbrella overhead, as if such behavior were normal. Initially this image seems a hallucination. It’s a surprise, to put it mildly, this ridiculous affectation, because as everyone knows, umbrellas are made to be used when it rains. The first few instances in which these umbrellas are sighted will be ascribed to the charitable guess that the people wielding them didn’t notice that the temperature has dropped low enough for the rain to have turned into beautiful white fluffy snowflakes. Or maybe these natives are crazy, or at the very least a little eccentric. But no, these people are everywhere, shrouded by their mostly black umbrellas from the lovely snow. And after the first winter, the now-jaded, not-so-new New Yorker will come to accept this practice as normal and mundane, and he will stop gawking. Yet deep down in his soul, the transplant will hold on to the notion that umbrellas are to be used only as protection against the rain, which is wet and, when it drenches the clothes and skin, makes one uncomfortable. The neophyte, who has turned into a jaded New Yorker, will find out in time that people don’t do this just in New York but in many other cities, too. It’s the old rural-versus-urban divide, the difference between accepting and finding enjoyment in nature’s arbitrary whims and refusing to find pleasure in this sort of thing. In New York, the sight of umbrellas raised aloft in the snow may be more common simply because the streets are filled with people wearing nice clothes and heading to and from work, and they will do anything to prevent melting snowflakes from ruining their outfits or God forbid mussing their hair. Even though this New Yorker will get used to the sight of those harried and hurried walkers warding off one of nature’s most precious gifts, he will still carry with him the feeling that blocking out snow’s charms borders on the insane, that a determined effort to not get touched by those wonderfully soft star-shaped flakes is patently absurd and always will be.",

    "source": "Unleashed at Last, Author Marty Appel Digs Deeper Into Thurman Munson’s Life <eos> Thirty-one years ago, Marty Appel wrote Thurman Munson ’s autobiography. Now, in an unusual literary leap, he has written a biography of Munson. “I never felt like I let anybody down with the first book,” Appel said last week in his Manhattan apartment. “I fulfilled my responsibilities. But I knew there was always so much more to the story.” Munson, the former Yankees captain and catcher, died 30 years ago when the private jet he was piloting crashed . Appel would not have pursued the new biography had Munson not been so reluctant to open up during 12 hours of interviews in 1977 and 1978. The autobiography was a routine look at a short career, unlike “ The Bronx Zoo ,” Sparky Lyle’s (and Peter Golenbock’s) humorous, candid best-selling book about the Yankees’ 1978 season. Not surprisingly, Munson’s memoir sold far better after his death. “It was Thurman’s book,” Appel said. “He was free to leave out whatever he wanted. He never said, ‘I’m not going there,’ but my questions weren’t Mike Wallace-like, either, because I was cooperating with him and telling the story he wanted to.” Munson might not have agreed to the autobiography had he not trusted Appel, who left his job as the Yankees’ public relations director in early 1977, shortly after Munson was named the 1976 American League most valuable player. Munson did not think much of writing a memoir — he was only 29 and thought it would be too personal an experience — until Appel reasoned that if someone else wrote a biography, Munson would hate it. The collaborator and biographer work at different ends of the life story spectrum. The former writes an as-told-to memoir controlled (but not always read) by the star. The biographer broadens the story in ways that may upset the star or his family. David Maraniss , the author of biographies of Bill Clinton, Vince Lombardi and Roberto Clemente, said he would never collaborate on an autobiography that he could not report thoroughly or write a biography authorized by the subject or his family. “How do you collaborate and maintain complete authorial integrity?” he wrote in an e-mail message in response to questions. “I suppose it’s possible, but not easy.” Among the writers who have collaborated on their subjects’ memoirs and wrote their biographies are O. B. Keeler and Al Stump . Keeler did it for a friend, the golfing great Bobby Jones . Stump wrote Ty Cobb’s 1961 autobiography but returned 33 years later with a harrowing, warts-filled biography of Cobb, the Detroit Tigers Hall of Famer, that Stump called redemption for participating in what he called the earlier “cover-up.” “It felt good to lay it on the line,” Stump said in 1994 after the release of the Ron Shelton film “Cobb ,” which described Cobb’s paranoid, unstable behavior. Appel did not have atonement for “Thurman Munson: An Autobiography” in mind while he thought about writing “ Munson: The Life and Death of a Yankee Captain ” (Doubleday). Instead, it was a sense that Munson’s reticence to discuss his upbringing in Canton, Ohio, or his emotional life warranted a biography. Also, his love of flying was an afterthought in the autobiography — and his death provided a tragic coda. The biography describes Munson’s love-starved family life in Canton with a difficult, sometimes cruel father, Darrell, and Thurman’s eager embrace by his teenage years of the family of his childhood sweetheart and future wife, Diana. Munson only hinted in the memoir about the turmoil at home that helped form his grumpy adult persona. But Appel’s interviews with Munson’s brother, Duane, and sister Darla describe the dysfunctional family life that turned him so inward. “I didn’t fully appreciate what was out there until I connected with his brother and sister,” Appel said. “They were the key to the book. They were the missing family.” In the autobiography, Munson described a tension-free scene with “happy faces” awaiting him at home in Canton when he signed his first Yankee contract in 1967. The new book had the Munson house “buzzing with excitement” except for Darrell Munson, hollering to the assembled family and friends, “He ain’t too good on pop fouls, you know!” Munson’s other sister, Janice, refused to speak to Appel. And while Diana Munson cooperated to a small degree, she declined to be interviewed. At her request, Appel removed a paragraph describing Munson’s autopsy report. Diana Munson did not respond to a message seeking a comment on the book. Appel’s interviews with Munson’s friends, coaches and teammates stressed his athletic abilities and the sadness that turned into his deep estrangement from his family. “His high school coach said he would typically drop kids off at home after practice,” Appel said. “But Thurman never wanted that because he didn’t want to take a chance of his coach meeting a family member.” Appel does not believe he has betrayed Munson by poking into family matters that he would not discuss in life. “I think he’d come to recognize that his story was an example to people that you can break the cycle,” he said, “that you can live a wonderful family life even if everything in your background says you can’t.”",

    "source": "Party Power Struggle Enthralls South Africa <eos> JOHANNESBURG, Oct. 11 — A politically powerful industrialist is gunned down in an ambush linked to a reputed mobster. Investigators link the mobster to the national police commissioner. Prosecutors obtain a warrant for the commissioner’s arrest. Then suddenly, the warrant vanishes — and the chief prosecutor who secured it is removed from his job. Not even South Africa ’s political insiders know for sure where this mystery leads, and the man who does know, President Thabo Mbeki , is not saying anything. But political and legal experts alike increasingly suspect the worst: that a brutal two-year battle for power in the governing African National Congress is spreading from party corridors into the government itself. With a convention to choose the party’s next leader barely two months away, a bitter rivalry between the two major camps — that of Mr. Mbeki, who aspires to continue as the party president, and that of the populist politician Jacob Zuma, who wants to replace him — has become even more caustic. Mr. Mbeki fired Mr. Zuma as deputy president in 2005 after investigators tied Mr. Zuma to a bribery scandal involving a multibillion-dollar military contract. Mr. Zuma has regularly accused prosecutors, and by implication Mr. Mbeki, of manipulating the justice system for political ends. Many analysts dismissed that as sour grapes. Now the same issue has surfaced in the case of the national police commissioner, Jackie Selebi, a senior figure in the party who is broadly asserted to be an Mbeki supporter. And some analysts are no longer so certain. Marinus Wiechers, for one, says that that he fears that the temptation to use the government’s powers for political ends has become irresistible. “The party-state is a thing that threatens all democracies, especially young democracies,” Mr. Wiechers, a constitutional law expert and former university vice chancellor, said recently. “If you break down the separation of powers, you’re certainly heading for a constitutional crisis.” Were that true, it would — like Nixon’s use of the Internal Revenue Service against his critics — be widely considered an affront to the nation’s democratic values. In what has become known as the Selebi affair, however, neither Mr. Mbeki nor his aides have explained why they intervened in a legal proceeding to prevent Mr. Selebi’s arrest. Rather, Mr. Mbeki has named a prominent member of the African National Congress to investigate the matter and broadly suggested that the full findings may not be made public for reasons of national security. Political commentators have already noted, acidly, that Nixon used that excuse to cover up his own transgressions. The basics of the Selebi affair are about the only things that remain clear. In September 2005, hit men pumped seven shots into a Johannesburg mining magnate, Brent Kebble. Investigators implicated a reputed organized-crime figure, Glenn Agliotti, known as the Landlord, who later said the Kebble murder was an “assisted suicide” that he helped arrange. Mr. Agliotti’s cellphone records showed that he called Mr. Selebi — South Africa’s police commissioner and the president of Interpol, the international police organization — from near the scene of the murder shortly after it occurred. In the ensuing outcry, Mr. Selebi denied any wrongdoing, called Mr. Agliotti a close friend and said he never discussed police business or criminal activity with him. Mr. Agliotti said he was only being a good citizen and reporting a crime to the police when he called Mr. Selebi. Mr. Mbeki declined to suspend or investigate Mr. Selebi, telling critics to have faith in his judgment. But investigators for South Africa’s elite anti-corruption squad, the Scorpions, found evidence of crimes involving the two men. Last month, Vusi Pikoli, the head of the Scorpions and the nation’s chief prosecutor, presented the secret evidence to two Johannesburg judges and secured warrants to arrest Mr. Selebi and to search his home and office. The warrants, however, were never executed. In late September, Mr. Mbeki’s justice minister apparently learned of the warrants, demanded that Mr. Pikoli resign and then suspended him when he refused, according to local news reports. Mr. Pikoli’s replacement then visited the two judges, asking them to rescind the warrants. The arrest warrant was canceled, the search warrant remains intact, Mr. Selebi remains in command — and to date, nobody has explained why. Mr. Mbeki has asked Mr. Pikoli’s successor to review the evidence against Mr. Selebi and to recommend whether any action is needed. Mr. Pikoli, meanwhile, is under investigation by Mr. Mbeki’s appointee, apparently for prosecutorial excesses. While the public version of the charges is not specific, it suggests that Mr. Pikoli is accused of giving immunity too liberally to organized-crime figures in return for incriminating evidence against Mr. Selebi, and of securing his arrest warrant without informing higher-ups. In South Africa’s Parliament, the African National Congress, which controls 7 in 10 seats, has closed ranks, and calls by the opposition to investigate the affair have been rebuffed. News of the arrest warrant and its reversal, aired in newspapers and only grudgingly confirmed by the government in the past month, has set off outrage in the news media and among South Africa’s minuscule political opposition. After nearly two weeks of daily headlines, Mr. Mbeki’s only public comment on the issue has been to joke that the president does not issue arrest warrants. “It’s a big mess,” said one veteran criminologist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared losing work with the government, “and it’s a mess that comes from the uncertainty about the boundaries that separate the state from the ruling party.” Bereft of facts, South Africa has been rife with speculation. The most damning version accuses Mr. Mbeki of protecting Mr. Selebi, a member of his party’s executive committee with some influence in the debate over the party’s next leader. Another version draws on the longstanding rivalry between the Scorpions and South Africa’s national police, the nation’s leading law enforcement organizations, and suggests that Mr. Pikoli overreached in an attempt to dispatch a rival. The Scorpions also broke the bribery case that led to Mr. Zuma’s dismissal in 2005. Although his friend and financial adviser has been sent to prison in that case, Mr. Zuma so far has evaded prosecution — and some suggest that Mr. Mbeki has sidelined Mr. Pikoli because he has moved too slowly to eliminate Mr. Zuma as a political rival. Or it could mean nothing, with due process occurring behind the scenes. Mr. Mbeki is a famously distant politician, renowned not just for ignoring public opinion but for shunning it. “The failure to answer questions and inform the country of what he’s doing is not a new feature of Mbeki’s style,” Steven Friedman, a longtime political analyst, noted drily.",

    "source": "Bridgeport Diocese Acknowledges 32 Abuse Accusations to Court <eos> TRUMBULL, Conn. (AP) — The Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport has acknowledged in court papers that it documented 32 accusations of sexual abuse of children by priests associated with a parish here over 40 years. The diocese made the admission last week in contesting a lawsuit filed by the estate of Michael Powel, who died last year. Mr. Powel had claimed that he was sexually abused at St. Theresa’s Parish in Trumbull between 1968, when he was 9, and 1972, when he was 13. The diocese is contesting a request from Mr. Powel’s lawyers to turn over all documents regarding sexual abuse by priests at the parish. In its filing in Superior Court in Waterbury, the diocese said it had compiled 126 boxes of documents and files detailing 32 accusations of abuse by eight priests at St. Theresa’s. Nine of the alleged encounters occurred before 1973, according to the court papers, and 18 accusations cover encounters that allegedly occurred from 1973 to 1983. Two accusations involve the period from 1984 to 1989, and three pertain to the years since 1990. The diocese is asking the court to allow it to withhold records on all allegations made after 1973, saying they are irrelevant to Mr. Powel’s lawsuit. In its filing, the diocese said it should not have to spend thousand of dollars to review the documents “simply because Michael Powel alleges he was abused one time for one minute in the winter of 1971.” Mr. Powel’s lawyers said that the motion by the diocese was a “bait-and-switch” to avoid producing documents by Wednesday, a date previously agreed upon to provide discovery materials. Mr. Powel, a former Florida resident, alleged that he was repeatedly abused by a longtime parish landscaping employee, Carlo Fabbozzi. Mr. Powel also accused Mr. Fabbozzi of introducing him to a priest, the Rev. Joseph Gorecki, whom Powel accused of molesting him once at St. Theresa’s school in 1971. A diocesan spokesman, Joseph McAleer, said priests from the parish who were found to have abused children are no longer in ministry and that the diocese removes from ministry any priest who is found to have abused a child. The diocese has fought the release of abuse records in the past. This year, it unsuccessfully appealed to the United States Supreme Court in an attempt to block the release of more than 12,000 pages of documents generated by lawsuits against priests. Judges have ruled that the documents be made public next week.",

    "source": "German Media Want Greek Finance Minister’s Head Over ‘Fingergate’ <eos> Speaking to a small group of Croatian radicals in 2013, an obscure Greek economist suggested that Greece should have simply defaulted on its debts in 2010 and told the German government to deal with the consequences. For emphasis, he used a crude expression and extended his middle finger, in an ancient gesture considered obscene even in the days of Diogenes . Two years later, that economist is Greece’s new finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, and video of his gesture found on YouTube by the German news media has made him into a lightning rod for populist anger in Germany over the increasingly acrimonious debt negotiations between the countries. Mr. Varoufakis tried and failed to quell the uproar during an interview on German state television on Sunday when he was confronted with the video and claimed that the footage had been “doctored” and that he had never made the gesture. Video professionals were called in and witnesses consulted as Bild, Germany’s most popular tabloid, tried to prove that Mr. Varoufakis had been caught lying about “Fingergate.” Mr. Varoufakis, who came to office after the triumph this year of the leftist Syriza party, suggested that it was “an honor” to have made an enemy of Bild, a right-wing newspaper. The video recording of the talk was confirmed as authentic on Monday in a statement posted on Facebook by its Croatian organizers, who nonetheless attacked the German news media for distorting the context and meaning of the gesture made by Mr. Varoufakis. He was aiming his criticism not at the German people or state but the government in Berlin, the Croats said, “which was at the time and today the main representative of disastrous austerity policies” in the European Union. Late Monday night, Mr. Varoufakis seemed to change tack, posting a link on his Twitter feed to an interview with Srecko Horvat, the Croatian philosopher who arranged the economist’s address to the Subversive Festival in Zagreb in 2013. Mr. Horvat argued that, while the gesture had been made, its meaning had been taken out of context. The finance minister followed suit by posting a link to the full video of the talk, and suggesting that by “doctored” he simply meant the clip had been edited out of its original context. The incident suggested that Mr. Varoufakis — whose Twitter biography says that he was “quietly writing obscure academic texts for years, until thrust onto the public scene by Europe’s inane handling of an inevitable crisis” — is struggling with the intensity of the media glare coming from the rest of Europe. The attention has not been uniformly negative. Last month, the German satirist Jan Böhmermann scored a viral hit with the off-color song “ V for Varoufakis ,” which turned on the premise that his nation was terrified by the primal sex appeal of the radical economist, known for wearing a leather jacket and riding a motorcycle. Mr. Varoufakis even invited a Paris Match photographer into his home in Athens recently, a decision he said he regretted as soon as the images were released and critics accused him of living the high life at the foot of the Acropolis while pressing Europe to bail out Greece. After the Paris Match photographs were posted online, and Mr. Varoufakis was roundly mocked online, he walked out of an interview with CNBC when asked if the images had made him “a liability” for his government.",

    "source": "Kerry Says Israel May Deepen Its Isolation by Opposing Iran Nuclear Accord <eos> WASHINGTON — Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday that the nuclear accord he negotiated with Iran was in Israel’s interest and that the Israeli government’s decision to oppose it could further its isolation. “I fear that what could happen is if Congress were to overturn it, our friends in Israel could actually wind up being more isolated and more blamed,” Mr. Kerry said in an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations. There was no immediate response from Israeli officials to Mr. Kerry’s comments, which he made before meeting with American Jewish leaders in New York. But a number of foreign policy experts said that they risked aggravating the tense relations between the Obama administration and Israel. “It is the kind of statement that would be far more compelling to Israelis, or many in the Jewish community, if it came from an Israeli raising questions about the government’s approach,” said Dennis B. Ross, a former negotiator and senior adviser to President Obama on the Middle East. “I am afraid it will have the opposite effect of what the secretary may have intended.” As if to underscore Mr. Ross’s point, Michael B. Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, assailed the comments. “If American legislators reject the nuclear deal, they will do so exclusively on the basis of U.S. interests,” Mr. Oren said in an email to reporters. “The threat of the secretary of state who, in the past, warned that Israel was in danger of becoming an apartheid state, cannot deter us from fulfilling our national duty to oppose this dangerous deal.” Republican lawmakers, and even some Democratic ones, have complained about the new nuclear accord, saying that core provisions limiting Iran’s nuclear program will expire in 10 to 15 years and that Iran may use the billions of dollars gained from the lifting of sanctions to carry out a more aggressive policy in the Middle East. Who Got What They Wanted in the Iran Nuclear Deal Here is a look at what Iran and the United States wanted, and what they got. Mr. Kerry has argued that the accord presents the best chance to rein in Iran’s nuclear program and that a rejection by Congress would lead to the very situation that the critics wish to avoid: the collapse of the international sanctions and a further expansion of Tehran’s nuclear efforts. But the opposition of the Israeli government has also been a factor in the debate. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sternly denounced the emerging agreement in a March appearance before Congress as a “bad deal” that would encourage Arab nations to pursue their own nuclear programs. Ron Dermer, Israel’s ambassador to Washington, has continued to argue against it in meetings with lawmakers, according to news reports. Israel’s opposition has resonated with some lawmakers who say that the Obama administration has turned a deaf ear to the concerns of a longtime ally to negotiate with Iranian leaders who still denounce the United States. In a congressional hearing on Thursday, Mr. Kerry sought to rebut that criticism by citing news reports that some former Israeli intelligence officials backed the agreement, and he highlighted his long record of supporting Israel when he was a senator. “I had a 100 percent voting record for 29 years here on the subject of Israel,” Mr. Kerry told the panel. “There’s no debate in this administration whatsoever about our willingness to commit anything and everything necessary to be able to provide for the security of Israel.” But Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East adviser to Democratic and Republican administrations, said Israeli officials were likely to view Mr. Kerry’s latest remarks in a different light. “It not only alienates the Israelis but fails to influence positively the very constituency the secretary presumably is trying to sway: Congress,” he said.",

    "source": "Geno Smith Practices as Jets’ Starter, With Ryan Fitzpatrick Unsigned <eos> FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — For now, Geno Smith is the starting quarterback of a team that has been candid about wanting to displace him, and he dresses among prominent veterans who have lobbied for his successor to return. It is a bizarre little situation, sort of like being slugged in the face by a teammate over an unpaid debt . Smith absorbed such a punch last August, prompting the promotion of Ryan Fitzpatrick, whose revelatory season, in a way, created this opportunity — however temporary, perhaps — for Smith. “Every player in the N.F.L., I think, deserves a fair opportunity,” Smith said. “Whether or not that’s the case, who knows? But I believe that I do have an opportunity here, and I’ve just got to take advantage of it.” On the surface, he has. Calling himself “just wiser” as he enters his fourth season, Smith said he had a deeper understanding of the offense. The offensive coordinator Chan Gailey agreed, basing his observation, he said, on the questions Smith had been asking during film reviews and meetings. Armed with that knowledge, Smith took a majority of the first-team snaps Wednesday, when the Jets had their second voluntary workout of organized team activities. The longer Fitzpatrick’s contract stalemate lasts, the more of those reps will go to Smith — even though the Jets hope he takes none for them this season. The Jets have been open about their desire to re-sign Fitzpatrick, who wants to be rewarded for leading them to 10 victories and setting a franchise record for touchdown passes in a season. Whether it happens next week, next month or before training camp, the expectation is that a deal will be reached. Fitzpatrick would reclaim his starting job, Coach Todd Bowles has said, pushing Smith into a backup role, ahead of two developmental quarterbacks, Bryce Petty and the rookie second-round pick Christian Hackenberg . In an otherwise peaceful 10-minute session with the news media, Smith bridled when asked if he wanted Fitzpatrick to re-sign. “That’s up to the front office and Ryan Fitzpatrick,” Smith said. “Why would I speak on that? Come on, man.” Bowles hesitated to say he was confident that the Jets would reach an agreement with Fitzpatrick. “You’re hopeful,” Bowles said. That has been the Jets’ sentiment since last season , expressed by General Manager Mike Maccagnan and teammates like receiver Brandon Marshall, one of Fitzpatrick’s most ardent supporters; receiver Eric Decker; and center Nick Mangold, who attended a Rangers playoff game with Fitzpatrick last month. Marshall, Decker and Mangold were not present Wednesday for a second consecutive day, inviting speculation that they were staying away as a sign of solidarity with Fitzpatrick, but Bowles played down their absences. So did Smith. “I think they’ve always been supportive of myself as well,” Smith said, adding, “I don’t think they’ve said anything negative about me.” Smith declined to say whether he envisioned himself starting the Sept. 11 season opener against Cincinnati, and it seemed a prudent decision. Bowles said he does not ask Maccagnan for updates on Fitzpatrick’s contract talks. “Just tell me when it’s done,” Bowles said.",

    "source": "Death Toll in Ukraine Conflict Exceeds 2,200, U.N. Says <eos> GENEVA — The United Nations said on Friday that casualties in the fighting between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian rebels had doubled in the past month, with an average of 36 people killed every day. At least 1,200 people were killed and 3,250 injured in the period from July 16 to Aug. 17, according to a report released by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva. The office described the toll as “very conservative” and said it did not include the 298 passengers and crew who died when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17. “The trend is clear and alarming,” Ivan Simonovic, the United Nations assistant secretary general for human rights, said in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, according to Reuters. “There is a significant increase in the death toll in the east.” The upsurge in fighting concentrated around the rebel-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk brought the total number of people killed in the clashes since mid-April to at least 2,220, and the number of injured to at least 5,956, the United Nations said, citing the reports of a 39-man monitoring mission working out of Kiev and four other cities. Ukraine’s military had to bear responsibility for “at least some” of the heavy loss of civilian life and for extensive damage to property resulting from the use of heavy weapons, including tanks and artillery, in densely populated areas, the report said. But armed rebels were faulted for positioning their heavy weapons in densely populated areas and for launching attacks from them, putting civilians at risk and violating international law. The rebel groups were “now professionally equipped and appear to benefit from a steady supply of sophisticated weapons and ammunition, enabling them to shoot down Ukrainian military aircraft such as helicopters, fighter jets and transport planes,” the report said. Ukraine claims the separatists’ weapons come from Russia. Moscow has consistently denied arming the rebels, even in the face of reports that Russian troops had crossed the border. On Thursday, NATO released satellite images that it said showed Russian forces operating on Ukrainian territory. Pro-Russian separatists had also committed a wide range of abuses including “killings, abductions, physical and psychological torture, ill treatment, executions, murder and other serious human rights abuses,” the report said. It did not provide a figure for the number of people being held prisoner by separatists, but said that as of mid-August at least 498 people were believed to have been detained. More than half the residents of Luhansk and Donetsk have left to escape the fighting and harsh living conditions, but rebels have targeted and killed civilians trying to escape conflict zones, United Nations investigators reported, and have stopped residents from leaving by harassing and robbing them at checkpoints. The United Nations also accused Ukrainian Army units and pro-Kiev battalions of abuses, in particular forced disappearances and torture. More than 1,000 people in eastern Ukraine have been arrested for what the government said was “irrefutable evidence of their participation in terrorist activities,” the report said. It also cited accounts of ill-treatment during arrest and detention.",

    "source": "Coalition Plays Down Afghan Reports of Major Battle in Helmand <eos> KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban attacked Afghan police posts in a violent and long-contested corner of southern Afghanistan, setting off two days of clashes that left at least six police officers dead, Afghan officials said Tuesday, though the American-led coalition played down the violence as little more than “drive-by shootings.” The Afghan government portrayed the fighting in the Sangin district of Helmand Province, which began Monday, as a major victory for its forces, with officials describing a massive Taliban effort to overrun the area. Omar Zwak, a spokesman for the provincial governor, put the number of attackers at 1,000 and said Arab and Chechen insurgents — that is, Al Qaeda members — were fighting alongside the Taliban. The Taliban also claimed to be engaged in a broad assault on Sangin, saying in a text message to reporters that insurgents had overrun three police posts and were close to taking more. The coalition, though, was far more circumspect about the scale of the fighting. It said the Taliban force totaled 80 to 100 fighters and managed to launch only sporadic attacks on outlying police posts in the district. Ten groups of between 8 and 10 Taliban fighters were “doing drive-by shootings against five police checkpoints,” said Col. Thomas Collins, a coalition spokesman. “None of the checkpoints were overrun.\" Another coalition official added that American Marines, who still maintain a sizable presence in the district, would have joined the fight had the Taliban presented any significant threat, and coalition air power would probably have been called in had the Taliban massed in numbers as large as those described by Afghan officials. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid publicly disagreeing with his Afghan counterparts. The Taliban have stepped up their attacks on the Afghan Army and police since the start of the annual fighting season. They say that a broad summer offensive that will expose the weakness of the Afghan security forces is now under way, and that they have managed to inflict significant casualties. At least six Afghan police officers were killed in the past two days in Sangin, for instance, according to Haji-Ghulam Ali Khan, the district police chief. But the most dramatic battles between the Taliban and the Afghan security forces seem to be those portrayed by their spokesmen for media consumption, with both sides claiming to have scored hard-fought victories over one another. This week’s fighting in Sangin could well prove to be part of the intensifying propaganda war. The district was the scene of fierce fighting by British troops and United States Marines to root out the insurgents, and both the Taliban and the Afghan government would benefit from claiming a victory there. But if the Taliban’s attack this week did consist mainly of sending small bands to harass police posts, as the coalition asserted, it would hardly count as a significant victory for either side. It would instead seem to indicate that the insurgents do not have the strength or the will to threaten the entire district with a head-on assault, and that the security forces there have yet to be tested by a big attack. Afghan officials, however, were adamant that their forces had repulsed a huge Taliban attack. “The Taliban were trying to show us their power but they have been repelled by Afghan forces,” said Mr. Khan, the police chief. The fighting had begun early Monday, and Afghan soldiers were called in to help repulse the attacks, he added. Some police were still engaged in isolated firefights, but order had been restored in most of the district, he said, adding that the Marines were not needed at any point in the fighting. “Taliban, with their great forces, attacked the boundary in which the security check posts surround the district center and some of the check posts are still under their constant firefighting,” he said. “We don’t know exactly how many Taliban have been killed. I can say they are losing their men.”",

    "source": "Nazi-Era Art Collection Appears to Find a Home <eos> BERLIN — A collection of more than 1,000 artworks obtained by a Nazi-era art dealer and kept private for decades by his son is expected to be accepted by the Kunstmuseum Bern, a small museum in Switzerland , fulfilling the son’s final wish. The discovery of the collection sent the art world into an uproar, renewing concerns about the fate of Nazi-looted art and the rights of the owners’ descendants more than a half-century after the end of World War II . The dealer’s son, Cornelius Gurlitt, threw the collection’s fate into uncertainty with his decision to bequeath it to the Kunstmuseum Bern. After more than six months of deliberation, the museum and the German government said Thursday that they would release information about the future of the estate on Monday. Sources with knowledge of the situation, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter, said it was likely that the board members would gather in Switzerland on Saturday to decide on Mr. Gurlitt’s gift. Stuart E. Eizenstat , a former deputy Treasury secretary who is now special adviser on Holocaust issues to Secretary of State John Kerry, said Thursday that it was his understanding that the museum would accept the offer. Mr. Eizenstat, who helped to negotiate the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, which entrenched the principle that governments and museums must take responsibility for the damage caused by the Nazi looting of Jewish art, applauded the museum for indicating that every item would be screened by experts to determine which have dubious provenance. “They’re going to have international art experts go through the collection,” Mr. Eizenstat said. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the museum intended to accept the collection, barring any last-minute legal hurdles. The Bern museum was stunned to learn after Mr. Gurlitt’s death in May that it had been named the sole inheritor of the hotly disputed collection, which has since been determined to hold at least two works that were looted by the Nazis: a 1921 portrait by Henri Matisse and the Max Liebermann picture “Two Riders on the Beach.” If the museum does not accept the gift, the collection would fall to several of Mr. Gurlitt’s distant cousins and the husband of his only sister, who died childless in 2012. Although his relatives had agreed to honor his wishes, one of his second cousins recently suggested she would challenge Mr. Gurlitt’s will. As of Thursday, she had not yet filed a petition with the Munich court handling the estate. Mr. Gurlitt lived a solitary life in a Munich apartment with the windows either papered over or heavily curtained even before the world’s media camped out at his doorstep after a report of the collection’s existence in the German newsmagazine Focus last year. Art lovers and descendants of Holocaust victims were outraged to learn that more than 1,000 paintings and drawings collected by his father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, had been in the possession of the German police for more than a year, seized as part of an investigation into possible tax evasion. Many works in the Gurlitt collection were plundered from German museums, but scores were suspected of having belonged to Jewish collectors who were forced to sell them at below-market prices, or had them confiscated as they fled the Nazis. Under pressure from Israel, the United States and Jewish organizations, Germany set up a special task force to investigate the provenance of the artworks, hundreds of which were listed in the government’s online database in an effort to increase transparency and speed the identification of possible claimants to the works. Although small, the fine-arts museum in the Swiss capital has its own restoration departments for paintings and sketches, which make up a sizable share of the trove. Many of the works, especially those Mr. Gurlitt had stashed in a home he kept in Salzburg, were for years exposed to fluctuations of temperature and are badly in need of restoration. Daniel Spanke, the museum’s curator, said that he had confidence in his staff’s ability to cope with the responsibilities involved in accepting the collection. Mr. Gurlitt reached an agreement with the German authorities shortly before his death, binding his heirs to return any works determined to have been looted or stolen by the Nazis. One of the paintings, the Liebermann, has been determined to belong to David Toren, an 89-year-old descendant of the Jewish industrialist David Friedmann. Mr. Toren’s attorney said he was confident the Kunstmuseum Bern would accept the collection and was certain that his client would finally receive the painting that he last saw hanging in his great-uncle’s home. “The museum is incredibly fortunate for having this collection fall into its lap, and this presents a real opportunity for the museum to raise its international profile by doing the right thing with regard to the portion of the collection that was stolen by Nazis,” said August Matteis, who represents Mr. Toren.",

    "source": "High School Football Inc. <eos> BRADENTON, Fla. — The sun had not yet set last Friday on a field ringed by palm trees when, on the first play from scrimmage, Shea Patterson rolled to his left and threw a 69-yard touchdown pass for his high school, IMG Academy, a private, for-profit sports boarding school. On the academy’s campus, a onetime tomato farm, the latest experiment in prep football is taking root and could produce, depending on one’s view, bountiful harvests of talent or a blight of professionalism. Coaches and officials around the country are watching with curiosity and wariness. Patterson, who is considered the nation’s top high school quarterback , threw the scoring pass to receiver Drake Davis, a national indoor sprinting champion. By halftime, Patterson had thrown four touchdown passes, including one to Isaac Nauta, who is rated as the country’s No. 1 tight end prospect. IMG Academy throttled Cocoa High School, a public school, 49-7, in a contest that many had expected to be a taut battle between two national powers from Florida but was so lopsided that a mercy rule took effect in the second half and sped the game. “We’re the best team in the country,” said Patterson, 18, a senior who is 6 feet 2 inches and 192 pounds, has a quick release, and has thrown 104 career touchdown passes with eight interceptions at three high schools. Nauta, 18, who is 6-4 and 237 pounds, said: “Every day in practice is just a grind against our own guys. That’s probably the best competition we’re going to face all year.” Their assuredness is as bold as the company behind the school: IMG, the global sports management conglomerate that has helped propel the competitive leap high school football has made beyond traditional community teams. Those teams still exist. But convention is being challenged by a more professional model at the highest levels as top players urgently pursue college scholarships, training becomes more specialized, big business opens its wallet, school choice expands, and schools seek to market themselves through sports, some for financial survival. Increasingly, prep football talent is being consolidated on powerful public, private, parochial, charter and magnet school teams. And recruiting to those schools is widespread in one guise or another. Image IMG's offensive coordinator, Rich Bartel, with quarterback Shea Patterson, who has attended three high schools and thrown 104 career touchdown passes. Credit Edward Linsmier for The New York Times IMG is at the forefront. It is trying to enhance its academy brand with football, perhaps the most visible sport. And it is applying a business model to the gridiron that has long been profitable for tennis and has expanded to golf, soccer, baseball, basketball, lacrosse, and track and field. The academy has nearly 1,000 students from more than 80 countries enrolled in prekindergarten through 12th grade and postgraduation. About half the students are international. The school, 45 miles south of Tampa, recruits football players from around the country. It offers high-performance training, college preparatory courses, coaches with N.F.L. playing experience, facilities that resemble a small college more than a high school, and a chance to play a national schedule and on ESPN against some of the highest-rated teams. Though IMG Academy has fielded a varsity football team for only three seasons and, as an independent school, is ineligible to play for a Florida state championship, it is stocked with six of the nation’s top 100 senior recruits. The roster has players from 21 states and six countries. This month, IMG flew to Texas for a game. On Saturday, it traveled to New Jersey and defeated another power, Bergen Catholic High School, 59-47. The full cost of tuition and boarding for a year of football at IMG Academy is $70,800, although need-based financial assistance is available. School officials would not provide specific figures, but they said that payments by families could range from tens of thousands of dollars to a competition fee (from $3,750 to $4,500) to nothing. Team helmets are adorned not with a lion or a tiger but with IMG’s corporate logo. The cheerleaders and the pep band come not from the school but are themselves all-star performers from the area. Even the team nickname, the Ascenders, suggests players are there with college in mind. The academy was founded in 1978 by Nick Bollettieri as a tennis boarding school on what he often says were 15 acres of repurposed tomato fields. Andre Agassi, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova have trained there. IMG bought the academy in 1987, and it now covers more than 500 acres. Football began in 2013 as part of a $197 million campus expansion. Games are played in a 5,000-seat stadium outfitted with suites and a jumbo video screen. Digital screens depict each player’s name and face on his locker. Some N.F.L. players train there in the off-season, as do college players preparing for the pro draft. A Finishing School for Football Players 11 Photos View Slide Show › Image Edward Linsmier for The New York Times IMG officials are upfront about their profit motive. And they have been backed financially by state lawmakers. They justify the assistance by citing the academy’s economic impact to the region in training more than 12,000 athletes yearly from the youth level to the pros and in hosting numerous amateur and professional sports competitions. Although it is private, IMG Academy has received more than $7 million from the Florida state budget over the past two years, according to news accounts. An additional $2 million was pledged by lawmakers in June but was then vetoed by Gov. Rick Scott . “We run a business,” said Chip McCarthy, a co-managing director of IMG Academy. “We call it sales and marketing. Some people call it recruiting. We’re promoting our program. If you look at any private school that emphasizes sports, they’re typically doing it to promote their school. A lot are trying to survive. You’re not going to curtail that.” McCarthy added: “With us, we’re very honest about it. We recruit nationally, we don’t recruit in Florida, and we’re probably the only school in the country that admits it.” Officials at IMG also freely say that the academy is not for everyone. Several highly regarded players have left, citing homesickness, a philosophical clash with coaches or a feeling of being overwhelmed by the collegelike commitment. Many high school football coaches and officials are closely following IMG Academy, wondering whether it portends the growth of similar academies or superleagues featuring top teams. “I’m 50-50 split,” said John Wilkinson, the coach at Cocoa High School, who faced IMG Academy last week and said he would do it again. “They’re high school kids, just like us. We’re playing a football game. The other 50 percent thinks the competitive advantage they have is kind of alarming, if they’re allowed to recruit. But it is what it is.” Image Left, the IMG locker room. Right, linebacker Rahshaun Smith at his locker before the game. Credit Photographs by Edward Linsmier for The New York Times Some Florida schools refuse to play IMG Academy. Some coaches from other states are upset that IMG has poached players whom they developed. And there are accusations — vehemently rebutted by IMG — that it is merely a football factory where “student” is a neglected companion in the term “student-athlete.” Other officials express fear that football might follow the path of high school basketball, which many feel has been corrupted by so-called diploma mills and the heavy influence of club teams and recruiting middlemen. “We just wouldn’t play them,” George Smith, the athletic director at St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, said of IMG Academy. He won six state championships and two national championships as the St. Thomas Aquinas football coach. “They’re exactly like all these basketball schools, except they’re a football school.” Mickey McCarty, who has coached three state championship teams at Neville High School in Monroe, La., and who lost a senior receiver to IMG Academy days before fall practice began, said the academy seemed less a traditional football team than a showcase for individual talent. “It sounds to me like they’re playing for self, to be promoted and recruited, which takes away everything we stand for,” McCarty said. Another view, of course, is held by IMG Academy. Criticism often seems to be uninformed and secondhand, said McCarthy, the academy’s co-managing director. Academy officials said that 186 athletes from IMG’s 2015 graduating class were playing various college sports, including six at Ivy League universities and four at service academies. Academics and athletics are intended to simulate the college experience with dormitory living, alternate-day classes, block scheduling and a focus on time management. “It is the best preparation for a high school kid to get to the next level quick,” said Kevin Wright, IMG Academy’s first-year head coach. A school guide describes a typical day for athletes: Breakfast from 6:30 to 7:30 a.m. Three classes lasting 80 minutes each. Forty minutes of tutoring and preparation for standardized tests. Lunch. Training and conditioning from 1:30 to 5:30 p.m. Dinner. Another hour of available tutoring and a mandatory 90-minute study hall. Football players said there was a curfew at 10:30 p.m. “I came here assuming it was going to be easy, it’s just going to be a football school, but I learned within the first week I was completely wrong,” said Kjetil Cline, 17, a senior receiver from Minnesota who plans to play football at the United States Military Academy. “That really opened my eyes about what college would be like, and I think it’s really prepared me for going to West Point and being able to handle that.” To be admitted into the Florida High School Athletic Association, IMG Academy agreed not to recruit athletes from Florida schools. The association said that it had received accusations of recruiting in-state by IMG but that none had been substantiated. The National Federation of State High School Associations has not taken an official position on IMG Academy, said Bob Gardner, the association’s executive director. But he added: “Academy teams, while they may be good teams and give great educations, it’s not something that we really believe in or would promote or espouse in any way. We think the high school experience is best served by the student-athlete who lives at home with his family and is part of his school, family and community.” The players at IMG and their families consider that approach to be antiquated. For Patterson, a quarterback who won state championships the previous two seasons at a high school in Louisiana, IMG Academy is serving as a finishing school. Patterson said he transferred to IMG in June to work on his speed, strength and conditioning. He plans to graduate in December, enroll for the spring semester at the University of Mississippi and challenge for the starting quarterback position there next fall as a freshman. “It’s definitely a professional decision,” he said. Steve Walsh, IMG Academy’s director of football, and Rich Bartel, the offensive coordinator, both played quarterback in the N.F.L. There are also sports psychologists, strength coaches and speed coaches to assist Patterson. He has at his disposal a 10,000-square-foot weight room; a sports science center to aid with hydration and nutrition; a biomechanics center; a vision lab, or “mind gym,” to enhance perceptual and cognitive skills; and a hospital for special surgery and sports rehabilitation should he be injured. Image Announcers and members of the news media watching the team warm up. Credit Edward Linsmier for The New York Times When IMG Academy played in Texas this month, it trained at Texas Christian University, and Wright, the Ascenders’ coach, said, “We’re thinking, ‘Hey, our practice fields are maybe a little bit better.’ ” At the top levels of high school football, some teams routinely travel to play teams in other states. Games are frequently broadcast on regional or national cable channels. Some players are offered college scholarships as early as eighth grade. Apparel companies also exert considerable influence. Nike operates training camps for select players. Under Armour sponsors a postseason all-star football game and IMG Academy itself, where players are told not to wear gear made by other companies. “It’s all driven by money, and you can’t beat money,” said John Bachman Sr., who coached Patterson to state titles the past two seasons at Calvary Baptist Academy in Shreveport, La. As a freshman, Patterson played at a high school in Texas. Bachman said he felt conflicted about Patterson’s decision to transfer to IMG Academy. Parents should have the right to choose the best school for their children, he said. If he had a son of Patterson’s skill, Bachman said, he would have considered the same move. “I’m a liar if I said I wouldn’t have,” Bachman said. Even so, he added, “I don’t think anything’s ever going to take the place of the local public high school or private school that pours itself into the kid, and it’s a family atmosphere and it’s about the team and sacrifice and so on.” Image IMG players after their 49-7 win over Cocoa. Credit Edward Linsmier for The New York Times Calvin Ashley, a top-rated junior tackle, left IMG Academy last spring and returned to his former school, Dr. Phillips High School, in Orlando, Fla. Rodney Wells, the football coach there, said that Ashley was homesick. “There’s a reason kids go to college when they are 18 and not 15, 16 or 17,” Wells said. “Calvin is only 16. A college atmosphere, being away from home, living in a dorm, that’s not an environment for a 16-year-old. You don’t have your neighborhood buddy. You can’t go home to your mom.” But for others, like Patterson, who is 18, IMG has been a comfortable fit. His grandfather played for a season with the Detroit Pistons. His father and three older siblings played collegiate sports. He said that IMG Academy “was going to get me the most ready on the field and academically” to play next season at Ole Miss. “There’s a lot more accountability,” Patterson said. “I’ve got to be at class every day at 7:45. Can’t skip a class. Can’t skip a study hall.” Sean Patterson Sr., Shea’s father, said, “If your son’s a great musician, you want to send him to Juilliard,” adding that for Shea, IMG Academy “is the spot” for polishing his football skills for college. “Some kids don’t want to leave that high school experience,” Sean Patterson Sr. said, describing his son’s transfer from Louisiana. “It’s important for them to have pep rallies. Shea’s already been through that. Sometimes you just know it’s time to move on.” Dressed in an Ole Miss shirt and hat, he added: “Who knows what they’re going to want him to do, but he’s going to be ready. They open with Florida State next year.”",

    "source": "Losses at Kabul Bank, Afghanistan’s Biggest, Could Be $900 Million <eos> KABUL, Afghanistan — Fraud and mismanagement at Afghanistan ’s largest bank have resulted in potential losses of as much as $900 million — three times previous estimates — heightening concerns that the bank could collapse and trigger a broad financial panic in Afghanistan, according to American, European and Afghan officials. The extent of these losses make it clear that keeping the bank afloat — something the government has said it is determined to do — would require large infusions of cash from an already strained budget. Banking specialists, businessmen and government officials now fear that word of Kabul Bank ’s troubles could prompt a run on solvent banks, destroying the country’s nascent banking system and shaking the confidence of Western donors already questioning the level of their commitment to Afghanistan. The scandal has severe political and security implications. Investigators and Afghan businessmen believe that much of the money has gone into the pockets of a small group of privileged and politically connected Afghans, preventing earlier scrutiny of the bank’s dealings. The spotlight on how political and economic interests in Afghanistan are intertwined threatens to further undermine President Hamid Karzai’s government. The bank is also the prime conduit for paying Afghan security forces, leaving the American military, which pays the majority of the salaries, looking for new banks to process the $1.5 billion payroll. As Afghan regulators struggle to find out where the money went, many officials and international monitors concede that the missing millions may never be recovered, raising questions of how the losses could be replaced to keep the bank from failing. Afghan officials and businessmen have said the money was invested in a real estate bubble that has since burst in Dubai, as well as in dubious projects and donations to politicians in Afghanistan. Millions of dollars have yet to be traced, and some of the money seems to have gone to front companies or individuals and then disappeared. The Afghan Central Bank and American officials are conducting their own parallel investigations, but the problems are so serious that the International Monetary Fund has not yet renewed an assistance program to Afghanistan that expired in September, threatening an essential pillar of support to a government reliant on international largess as it battles a nine-year insurgency. Many donor countries may have to delay aid to Afghanistan because of their own requirements that money go only to countries with I.M.F. programs in good standing, Western diplomats said. Several officials described the bank as “too big to fail,” referring to its role in paying the salaries of hundreds of thousands of government employees. While Afghan and American officials depict a crisis far worse than has been made public, State Department cables released by WikiLeaks show that Afghan and Western regulators were aware of many of the problems, but were most focused on the problem of terrorist financing, rather than the fraud scheme that was the main problem at Kabul Bank. A stream of complaints about the bank’s practices — many of them the problems that now threaten the bank’s survival — are dutifully recorded in the cables, but diplomats, at least in 2009 and early 2010, seemed not to have realized the profound effect they could have on the financial system as a whole. Although other banks here have had questionable loan practices, so far it is only Kabul Bank — where what amounts to an enormous fraud scheme was conducted over a period of years — whose troubles are sending tremors through the Afghan business community and worrying Western donors. Deloitte, a top United States accounting firm that had staffers in the Central Bank under a United States government contract over the last several years, either did not know or did not mention to American authorities that it had any inkling of serious irregularities at Kabul Bank. Deloitte was not responsible for auditing the bank’s books; a spokesman for Deloitte did not respond to requests for comment. In an interview this weekend, Mahmoud Karzai , President Karzai’s brother and a prominent investor in the Kabul Bank, said that the new president of Kabul Bank, Masood Musa Ghazi, told him in the last several days that there were approximately $800 million in loans still outstanding. These are potentially unrecoverable. Mr. Karzai said Mr. Ghazi told him that of that $800 million, the bank’s new management has negotiated agreements for the repayment of about $300 million, but little has been repaid. Mr. Ghazi, who was appointed after the Central Bank forced a change in the bank’s management last fall, did not respond to phone calls or e-mails seeking comment, nor did anyone at Afghanistan’s Central Bank. Kabul Bank has extensive links to senior people in the Afghan government. In addition to Mahmoud Karzai, other shareholders included Haseen Fahim, the brother of the first vice president, and several associates of the family from the north of Afghanistan. Afghan officials said the bank poured millions into President Karzai’s election campaign. It is the loans and personal grants made by the bank to powerful people, including government ministers, that could prove the most explosive, Western and Afghan officials said. “If people who are thought to be clean and who were held up as ‘good’ by Western countries suddenly are caught with their fingers in the till, it will cause questions from donors,” said a Western official in Kabul. “They will say, ‘Why are we here?’ ” Mahmoud Karzai said that he believed the bank’s former chairman, Sherkhan Farnood, was responsible for the problems at the bank, saying that he often moved large amounts of money out of the bank on his own, with no oversight. Mr. Farnood could not be reached for comment on Sunday, and has declined to comment in the past. Mr. Karzai and Mr. Farnood were previously business partners, but had a falling-out over the operation of Kabul Bank. While he was in charge, Mr. Farnood had total control over what loans were made and what money was moved out of Kabul Bank, Mr. Karzai said. He said he was told by the bank’s managers that Mr. Farnood took about $98 million out of Kabul Bank to finance the purchase and subsequent operations of Pamir Airways, a small passenger airline in Afghanistan. In a cable from Sept. 26, 2009, posted by WikiLeaks, American diplomats said that competitor airlines complained that “Kabul Bank is using its deposit base to subsidize Pamir Air without its depositors’ knowledge in an attempt to drive competitors out of business.” Mr. Karzai said that Mr. Farnood had been given space at Kabul Bank, where he was supposed to be helping the new management find the bank’s missing money. “I think the bank is working with him to figure out what happened to the money, because he knows whom he lent it to and he knows where it is,” Mr. Karzai said. A spokeswoman for the United States Treasury Department in Washington declined to comment on the American inquiry. “The situation of Kabul Bank is extremely serious,” said a Western diplomat in Kabul. “What you can observe is that the loans were either to fictive operators who did not exist or they were for investments outside the country.” “Some were loans or personal grants to people linked to one shareholder or another shareholder,” the diplomat said. According to businessmen in Kabul, loans were made to people who were fronts for the real beneficiaries. “Sometimes they would bring a loan document to someone who was a gardener or a cleaner and just ask them to sign it, and they would pay him 500 Afghanis and the person could not read or write more than his name,” said a prominent businessman here with ties to the banking community. “Then, when the new bank managers go to look for the money, they go to the gardener’s house and they look around and they see there is nothing worth $100, and they have no idea where the money went.” Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Kabul, said that officials were working closely with the Afghan government, the I.M.F. and the World Bank. “Corrective action in response to any instance of abuse, poor banking practices or fraud is essential for public and international confidence in Afghan financial institutions and the development of Afghanistan’s financial sector,” she said. In Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province , a Kabul bank branch has been shut down for a week because employees transferred $1.3 million to Mr. Farnood, who was removed last fall for mismanagement. In Kabul, the Ministry of Finance is putting out bids for a new bank to pay the salaries of the security forces, which previously had been paid exclusively through Kabul Bank, according to Col. John Ferrari, the head of training programs for NATO’s training mission here. Military officials say that none of the $1.5 billion in payroll for the Afghan Army and the police has been reported missing. But concerns over the possibility that the bank could fail was one factor prompting the ministry to seek other banks to process payroll, Western officials said. A WikiLeaks cable from last February suggested that payments were often delayed so the bank could make money on the overnight interest rates. In a Feb. 13, 2010, cable, Kabul Bank is described as “the least liquid bank operating in Afghanistan” and its difficulty in raising cash was so great that it took “more than two days to process withdrawals and has delayed paying government employee salaries by two weeks in order to place those funds in overnight accounts to collect interest.”",

    "source": "Science in the Quest to Ease Figure Skating's Strains <eos> NEWARK, Del. — Melissa Bulanhagui is a highly ranked figure skater, but two years ago her right ankle failed her. She sprained it twice and tore a ligament, each time during one of her favorite jumps, the triple lutz. Other skaters have suffered similar injuries, and now science is studying why, aiming to help skaters meet the sport’s physical challenges without sacrificing their health. For one study, Ms. Bulanhagui (pronounced BULL-en-hayg-ee), 18, and other skaters tape to their shins devices called tibial accelerometers, which measure the force of the impact when skaters land a jump. “A lot of the impacts are really high, 90 to 100 G’s,” said Kat Arbour, a skater turned graduate researcher at the University of Delaware . “If you hit your head that hard, I don’t think you’d survive.” But she said study results suggested that the issue was not jumping itself, but how well jumps were executed. “If someone is really proficient, they seem to be able to modify their technique to decrease the impact, use muscles differently to absorb that shock,” she said. The accelerometer study is part of a flowering of research on safety and performance. And it is no coincidence that such research is growing at a time when figure skating, a year-round pursuit for competitive skaters, emphasizes athleticism and endurance more than ever before. Adjustments to international judging guidelines in 2003 made skating “much more physically and mentally challenging,” said Mitch Moyer, senior director of athlete high performance for United States Figure Skating, which is sponsoring the accelerometer study and others. Each skill in a performance now receives specific points, requiring more focus. And skaters no longer have an incentive to perform all jumps early in a program before they tire — now, jumps done later earn extra points. “People said, ‘Oh, it’s an art,’ but the reality is it’s a very taxing sport,” said Michelle Provost-Craig, associate professor of exercise physiology at the University of Delaware. “Many skaters end up with stress fractures, knee problems and hip problems at a fairly young age.” Research could inspire new training recommendations concerning issues like off-ice conditioning and limiting repetitions of jumps during practice. United States Figure Skating now has a sport sciences and medicine director, who works with scientific researchers and helps coaches monitor skaters’ health more closely and pace workouts. “Coaches are paying a lot more attention to these things,” said Mr. Moyer, who said some concerns were set off by a “trend of hip issues” with skaters like the Olympic champion Tara Lipinski , whose hip injuries required surgery at 18. “I hear a lot more buzz out there — ‘you need to stop jumping, you’ve done enough today.’ ” Scientists are looking at skating from every angle — biomechanics, physics, muscle conditioning, body fat, oxygen consumption, exercise-induced asthma . Ms. Arbour, of the University of Delaware, has skaters, wearing swimsuits and nose clips, climb into the “bod pod,” an egglike capsule measuring fat and muscle composition. A “bone densitometer” analyzes bone density, which tends to increase with frequent impacts. “If it’s low, they are at risk for stress fractures in the legs and lumbar spine,” she said. “If it’s too high, they are at risk for osteoarthritis because the cartilage is taking a lot of shock absorption.” With Professor Provost-Craig, Ms. Arbour also outfits skaters with “a crazy dungeon thing that goes over the mouth and nose,” measuring oxygen and carbon dioxide in air skaters expel. Science is even filtering into recreational skating, with the development of synthetic ice, intended to broaden appeal and year-round interest. But most research concerns competitive skaters. Some researchers are interested, for example, in the sport’s effects on younger skaters, said Mr. Moyer, because “kids develop differently at different ages. If somebody’s injured at 14, was it because of what they were doing at 9 or 10, or at 14?” Professor Provost-Craig plans to study whether certain jumps generate such physical impact that younger skaters should delay learning them. “A lutz might put more loading on a young skeletal developing frame than a toe loop,” she said. “They may choose, especially during a growth spurt, not to teach a new jump with extensive loading characteristics.” Some research focuses on training and equipment. James Richards, senior biomechanist for the Human Performance Laboratory at the University of Delaware, designed a skate boot to provide flexibility for pointing toes and maneuvering feet. Current boots are stiff for support, “comparable to a cast,” said Kelly Lockwood, an associate professor of physical education and kinesiology at Brock University in Ontario , preventing the ankle from absorbing enough impact. Professor Richards’s boot, hinged around the ankle, allowed flexibility but fell apart after about a month, he said. And skaters and coaches thought it unattractive. “People were willing to give it a try if it was helping in impact and injury,” Mr. Moyer said. He said that Alissa Czisny, currently the national champion, wore the boots for a while, but that she and others “became frustrated with some of the challenges.” He hopes the accelerometer study will indicate whether “one type of boot design or blade design could maybe reduce the stress load.” Professor Lockwood has studied something more rudimentary: how skate blades are sharpened. A blade’s bottom is not flat, but grooved to create two edges that grip the ice. A study with the National Hockey League of groin injuries found that “more than 50 percent of them are due to skate sharpening, way too deep a hollow” in the blade’s groove, which can give a player too much traction instead of allowing easy gliding, she said. Sharpening, it turns out, is hard to do well, and sharpeners who earn respect from skaters and coaches have become scientists of sorts, too. George Knakal, a 79-year-old retired cabinetmaker turned sharpener in Norwalk, Conn., pays zealous attention to several factors, including the concavity of the blade. “For a new skater, I make it nearly flat because a little kid is very awkward and you want to give them something that will slip so when they fall they don’t get hurt,” he said. Training when not on ice is another matter altogether, and theories differ about what off-ice conditioning is best. “It’s a sport where you’re doing contradictory things,” said Deborah King, associate professor of exercise and sport sciences at Ithaca College. “Running or cycling or stair-stepping to improve aerobic capacity — does that translate really well on the ice, or is it better to do something more specific to skating? Do you need a lot of strength training in the gym or training to do the motion while rotating?” Professor Provost-Craig said skaters should not “bulk up” from strength training because “if they increase girth of shoulders, hips or thighs, that’s going to decrease rotational spin.” One recent invention for off-ice training is a block of wood topped with rubber, slanted to approximate angles of skaters’ blades on ice. Wearing skates on the block, skaters assume different positions. “It will freeze-frame any on-ice technique and mimic as close as you possibly can the requirements for balance, that sensation of shifting your weight against momentum,” said its creator, David Lipetz, a physical therapist who is trying to get coaches and skaters to use the device. Professor Provost-Craig’s oxygen mask readings help gauge the aerobic conditioning skaters need, measuring their “VO2 max,” she said, “oxygen their muscles are consuming” as they skate to increasingly fast music . More is better, improving endurance, for example, to do jumps later in performance. Professor King analyzed jumps in a different way. Studying Olympic skaters, she determined that on triple jumps, they went no higher than on double or single jumps — rather, they rotated faster by pulling in their arms, making their bodies compact. That guides one of Professor Richards’s more elaborate projects. With sophisticated motion-capturing cameras and computer programs, he mimics skaters’ positions during jumps and calibrates the effect of altering angles of the head, torso, arm and leg. Consider Emma Phibbs, a 22-year-old pairs skater looking to make a comeback after scaling back skating in college. Recently, researchers affixed 38 quarter-size stickers — made from golf ball markers, children’s alphabet beads and reflective tape — all over Ms. Phibbs’s body and sent her skating. Doing triple toe loops and double axels, she wobbled on some landings, occasionally falling. Rink-side, Professor Richards’s computer displayed an outline of Ms. Phibbs, construed from the reflective stickers. “Her left arm is higher than her right arm — she’s got to lean to one side to compensate,” he said. Breathless from jumping, Ms. Phibbs reviewed the computer images. “With my elbow and my trunk being off, my landing will be off and I’ll two-foot it,” she said. Then Tom Kepple, a researcher, displayed an animated avatar of Ms. Phibbs’s jump attempts, calculating that she rotated only 314 degrees. With a few keystrokes, he tucked the left arm in. “That adds 40 degrees more of revolution,” he said. “If she brought the left leg in a little straighter? You pick up 10 or 15 degrees rotation. But if she brings her leg in too much, the jump goes bad.” Such analysis works “not just for technique, but also for injury prevention,” Mr. Moyer said. “You can see what your result is going to be before you try it.” That could make a difference for skaters who must train aggressively enough to master moves but not aggressively enough to hurt themselves. “I always tell my athletes that they’re going to be injured at some point in their career, so it’s more about management of that and also trying to have a minor injury instead of a major injury,” said Tom Zakrajsek, who coaches top skaters. “I have certain jump limitations and restrictions — I always have to pull back my skaters from repetition of jumping.” In Delaware , after the scientists opined on Ms. Phibbs’s body position, she got back on the ice. “I focused on keeping my elbow down, and my landings were a lot more solid,” she said. “It definitely proved itself.”",

    "source": "The Gofer’s Expanding Portfolio <eos> Sergio Kletnoy was trapped in traffic and running behind schedule. As the executive assistant to Joanna Coles, the editor of Cosmopolitan magazine, Mr. Kletnoy had spent the day scheduling a December lunch for Ms. Coles, booking her business trip to Boston and accompanying her to Chelsea, where she made a speech before an online financial group while he held her purse. In a free moment, he had interviewed the singer Betty Who for Cosmopolitan’s blog and arranged for Ms. Coles to meet her as well. Now he was urging the driver to swiftly return them to Hearst’s Midtown headquarters. The timetable was tight. Ms. Coles had to dive into the premiere of Rebel Wilson’s new TV show “Super Fun Night” while Mr. Kletnoy waited to interview the actress for the blog. In a few hours, Mr. Kletnoy would head out to see the singer Lorde perform before interviewing her the following day. “It feels like her Duracell battery will never, ever, ever stop,” Mr. Kletnoy, 36, said of Ms. Coles. “Joanna goes 150 miles an hour and sometimes it’s hard to catch up.” He paused, contemplating his own place in the fast-paced New York media world: “A year from now,” he said, “there may be a cooler executive assistant to take my spot. So I don’t take it for granted.” Mr. Kletnoy’s experience reflects the evolving role of magazine assistants, who for years have been defined by the stinging indignities they endured at the hands of the industry’s most imperious editors — famously brought to life in the 2003 book “The Devil Wears Prada” and the subsequent film adaptation. Image Sergio Kletnoy performs tasks for Joanna Coles, the editor of Cosmopolitan magazine, but his job at Cosmopolitan goes well beyond the administrative. Credit Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times There are still bosses like Miranda Priestly in the magazine world, barking at minions to book tables at the Lambs Club or having them trail behind them carrying half-eaten tuna sandwiches. But as magazines deal with new financial challenges, including budget cuts that have trimmed the staff, few editors can afford to squander the employees they have left on tasks like hanging up their coats when they swoop into the office. True, fetching coffee may never completely disappear from the job description, but assistants like Mr. Kletnoy have been empowered in part because they are part of a more connected generation. The modern assistant has an understanding of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram that time-stretched (and old school) magazine executives lack, and increasingly they are assuming responsibility for spreading the magazine’s message, and brand, across social media. Richard David Story, the editor in chief of Departures, hired Lauren Weisberger after she worked as an assistant to Anna Wintour at Vogue. He later encouraged Ms. Weisberger to write about her experiences at the magazine, which led to her best-selling book, “The Devil Wears Prada.” Mr. Story said that when interviewing potential assistants, “I ask the same, old-fashioned questions, I look at the same, old-fashioned qualities.” But he nevertheless sees fundamental differences in the qualities he is looking for now as opposed to years ago. He might still ask job candidates how they would feel about picking up a vanilla skim latte, assuming he would do the same for them in return, but added, “I need somebody completely up and running in the 21st-century style, with all the digital and social media bells and whistles.” Image Mr. Kletnoy is Ms. Coles’ blogging, tweeting assistant at Cosmo. Credit Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times Mr. Kletnoy, who has worked for Ms. Coles since 2007, first at Marie Claire, seems to thrive in this role. At Cosmopolitan’s 38th floor offices, he dutifully completes his administrative tasks while he blogs, tweets and poses for photographs with the celebrities who pass through. While Mr. Kletnoy humors Ms. Coles’s love of Cyndi Lauper, he insisted she meet a more current performer, the pop singer Ellie Goulding, when she arrived in the United States for a tour and more recently with the 14-year-old singer Madison Beer. He also provided the music mix Jennifer Lopez listened to during her fashion shoot for the October cover. Ms. Coles can be tough and demanding, and Mr. Kletnoy says that managing her schedule of 15 to 20 appointments a day can be a nightmare. “I book her so far in advance that when we actually reach that week, she’ll say: ‘You know what? This can be moved,’ ” he said. “It’s definitely the biggest part of being an executive assistant.” Scheduling aside, Ms. Coles expresses disdain for the kind of mistreatment featured in “The Devil Wears Prada.” She started her career in newspapers, where assistant positions were trimmed from budgets years ago. She never worked as an assistant and has clear ideas of what personal and professional demands are appropriate. In a pinch, she said, she has asked Mr. Kletnoy to babysit her sons, but paid him for it and doesn’t consider that part of his job. “Inevitably personal life flows from work life,” Ms. Coles said. “I’m not an abusive employer. It’s something I find repulsive.” Dominique Lemoine, the 27-year-old assistant to James Oseland, the editor of Saveur and a judge on “Top Chef Masters,” performs predictable tasks like cleaning the office refrigerator. But she also writes articles for Saveur’s website and has written short pieces for the print magazine (she has one in the next January/February issue). She said that while she sometimes makes restaurant reservations for Mr. Oseland, he has never asked her to get coffee or pick up lunch. Image Mr. Kletnoy posing with the singer Madison Beer, 14. Credit Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times “He is very respectful,” Ms. Lemoine said. She added that the only way she identifies with “The Devil Wears Prada” is in “yearning to write more.” Mr. Oseland said he never wanted Ms. Lemoine to feel like he did when he was a young intern, working for the production team on the 1988 film “Dracula’s Widow” and performing menial tasks like buying cookies for the crew. “It’s not only what goes around comes around,” Mr. Oseland said. “It’s also a simple business decision. I don’t want to have somebody who is so essential to the basic functioning of my life feeling resentful.” One assistant who ended up feeling resentful is Melanie Neuman, 32, who has a master’s degree in bioengineering but wanted to transition into an industry with a stronger support network for women. In 2011 she began working for three senior executives at Condé Nast. She said that she was treated professionally by two of them, but the third was a different story. Ms. Neuman said that she could rarely leave her desk because her boss believed a caller should never have to leave a voice mail message.

After emigrating to New York City in 1989 from Ukraine, he worked his way up through Motown Records, Sony, Arista and Virgin. But his career in music, he said, was marked by midnight phone calls asking him to change hotel rooms or to find a new chauffeur because a musician disliked the chauffeur. “In music, they feel like you’re lucky to be here,” he said. “I remember getting thanked only two or three times over the years.” In 2006, Mr. Kletnoy was “so burned out dealing with musicians” that even the film “The Devil Wears Prada” couldn’t scare him away from the magazine business. “I like a challenge,” he said. As he stood close to Ms. Coles at the Rebel Wilson premiere, he talked about how it might be fun someday to be an assistant to a fashion designer. It’s a particular interest — he writes for the fashion blog Daily Front Row . For now, though, he is sticking with Ms. Coles. “I’ve never had a boss where I’m respected like Joanna respects me,” said Mr. Kletnoy. “In life, you have to do what feels right for you.”",

    "source": "Art That Walks a Fine Line Between Reality and Illusion <eos> In “The Republic,” Plato uses an allegory of prisoners chained in a cave watching shadows on a wall to suggest that the things we believe are real are often only an illusion, a kind of puppet show of real life. To experience true reality we must escape from the cave of ignorance and into the clear light of day. “Shadow Show,” at Real Art Ways in Hartford, picks up in various ways on this metaphor. The curators — Elizabeth Keithline, a Rhode Island artist who originated the idea, and Kristina Newman-Scott, director of visual arts at Real Art Ways — have assembled the work of 16 artists exploring shadows and concepts of shadowing in contemporary culture. Exhibits range from installations that use actual shadows for visual effect to video art and elaborate conceptual pieces concerned with issues of surveillance, memory, perception and truth. That the majority of the artwork is installed in the dark is, I suspect, more an accident of curatorial selection than any nod to Plato, but it nonetheless adds an overall, welcome air of mystery. Entering this exhibition you feel as if you are stepping into an alternate universe, a place where nothing is entirely as it seems. Or maybe for the first time we begin to see the delicate nature of reality. Using digital animation software, Rupert Nesbitt creates realistic-looking video landscapes that move. An occasional distortion of perspective reveals that the imagery has no basis in reality, and that these are purely imaginative spaces, but most of the time you think you are looking at a real environment. Shadowy government activities are the subject of William Allen’s nine-panel text paintings examining the history, purpose and mythology around the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center, a United States government structure near Bluemont, Va. Here, beneath a FEMA training base, is an underground operation designed to house government officials in case of a nuclear emergency. Humor is lacking from this show, with the exception of William Lamson’s one-minute animated video loop. It is made up of photographs of the artist lying face down in various suburban landscapes, that have been spliced together to make it seem as if his motionless body is sliding along the ground like some giant worm. Though it is sort of silly, the imagery is captivating. What I also like about this video is the way in which it plays with our willingness to respond positively toward that which we know isn’t real. This is in some ways the opposite of what Plato was talking about, for it involves a knowing appreciation of something clearly artificial — as if we are heading back into Plato’s cave just for the fun of it. Several artists in this show are interested in the idea of traces, evidence of things left behind in the landscape, or in the mind, or on the body. This is a popular theme in contemporary art but has a particular, even special relevance here. Perhaps most interesting among the works of this kind is a collaborative installation by an artist, Duncan Laurie, and an electrical engineer, Gordon Salisbury. It is installed in a darkened room off to one side of the exhibition. Inside the room is a rock hooked up to a device measuring energy waves, and a video of hallucinogenically pulsating signals that represent naturally occurring energy waves in plants and rocks. Whereas Mr. Laurie and Mr. Salisbury’s installation is all about picturing hidden energy flows, Olu Oguibe’s sculptural installation, “Buggy Memorial to the Unknown Child,” makes manifest complex human emotional states. This deeply personal work is all about the artist’s feelings surrounding the pointless death of his brother, at the age of 4, from dehydration after a routine attack of measles. Things half-hidden are the subject of Sam Ekwurtzel’s pair of video loops, a compilation of close-ups of photographs of television sets for sale on eBay. Mr. Ekwurtzel discovered that when the owners photographed their television sets to sell online, many inadvertently captured reflections of themselves and their living rooms on the reflective surface of the television screens. By cropping and blowing up these images the artist reveals a hidden world. There are many other interesting works here dealing with shadowy issues, ranging from street surveillance of random individuals in snapshot photographs by Erik Gould to the documentation of the noises and atmosphere of an airport lounge in an installation by Barbara Westermann. Like so many other artworks here, they zoom in on things that we look at but rarely see.",

    "source": "Combustible Conditions but No Unrest Yet in Uganda <eos> KAMPALA, Uganda — Fresh from fighting in the bush, Uganda ’s president, Yoweri Museveni, a former rebel commander, electrified the crowd at his inaugural address in 1986 when he declared that “the problems of Africa, and Uganda in particular, are caused by leaders who overstay in power.” He vowed never to be one of them. Now, after 25 years in office, he is running again. Voting began on Friday across the country in an election that could give Mr. Museveni, a close American ally whose relatively small nation gets hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid, his fifth consecutive term as president. By all measures — polls, diplomatic analyses, even taxi-driver talk — he is expected to win. But while Uganda shares many of the same, combustible conditions that have fueled popular uprisings in the Arab world — grinding poverty, masses of jobless, students glued to Facebook and a leader who refuses to step down after more than two decades in power — few here expect widespread upheaval. In fact, the persistence of authoritarianism, whether through acceptance or a sense of helplessness to do much about it, seems to be the rule across much of sub-Saharan Africa, home to some of the most everlasting strongmen in the world: José Eduardo dos Santos in Angola, in power since 1979; Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea, also since 1979; Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, since 1980; Omar Hassan al-Bashir in Sudan, since 1989. And the list goes on. “There are two main reasons why we’re not seeing North Africa-style popular revolts in sub-Saharan African,” said Phil Clark, a lecturer in international politics at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. First, he argued, many sub-Saharan African countries are more divided ethnically, and such divisions “undermine the possibility of a mass social movement against the national leadership.” Second, and partly connected, is the loyalty of the army, which is often built from the president’s ethnic group and bolstered by corrupt spoils. “Museveni and Mugabe can rely on total commitment from the military,” Dr. Clark said. “The fear of violent military crackdowns keeps many Ugandans and Zimbabweans off the streets.” Many young urban Ugandans, who have been watching their Arab counterparts stage huge protests, seem to agree. “Ugandans have no unity,” said Charles Rollins, a 21-year-old university student, speaking about ethnic divisions. “That is why we are different.” Robert Lugolobi, executive director of Transparency International’s Uganda chapter, argued: “People here are too tribal. Uprisings happen, but they happen by tribe.” In September 2009, dozens of young Ugandans were killed by the security forces in intense rioting in Kampala, the capital. They were members of the Baganda ethnic group and furious that Mr. Museveni’s government was trying to curtail the powers of their traditional king. The government cracked down harshly, and few expect the Baganda to riot again like that anytime soon. Of course, ethnic divisions alone do not explain the notable lack of anti-authoritarian protests in most of sub-Saharan Africa. Yemen has long suffered serious tribal conflicts, but that has not stopped demonstrators there from demanding an end to the authoritarian rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. In Egypt, protesters across religious, ideological and class lines all descended on Tahrir Square to oust President Hosni Mubarak. Here in Uganda, many young people support Mr. Museveni, who is credited with turning the country around. Over the past few days, they have packed shoulder to shoulder at rallies, waiting patiently under a punishing sun, some of them waving hilarious posters of the mzee, or old man, as the president calls himself, with his face superimposed on an Incredible Hulk-like body. “Mzee, our freedom fighter,” the slogan goes. Mr. Museveni, who was born in 1944 — official documents do not provide an exact date — has tried to cultivate a folksy, avuncular image, often appearing at campaign rallies with his wife, Janet, and decked out in a wide-brimmed planter’s hat. Even among detractors here and abroad, he is not usually spoken of in the same breath of, say, Mr. Mugabe, who is widely blamed for transforming a once prosperous country into one of the world’s poorest . Uganda’s agricultural-based economy stands in stark contrast to that, growing steadily over the past few years, by a respectable 6 or 7 percent. Oil is on its way, 200,000 barrels per day, starting as early as next year, which could increase growth much more. Mr. Museveni’s message, printed on ubiquitous yellow T-shirts, is peace and security, and Uganda has come a long way on that front. In the 1970s, it was haunted by a dictator, Idi Amin, notorious for beating people to death with his own hands. In the 1980s and 1990s, the rebels of the Lord’s Resistance Army terrorized the countryside, slicing off lips and hacking away at villagers. Today, Kampala is reasonably safe — definitely much safer than Nairobi, in neighboring Kenya — and the rebels have been pushed out of the country. This stability carries some costs, though. Mr. Museveni’s opponents and Western analysts accuse him of running a vast and corrupt patronage system and abusing human rights. This month Human Rights Watch said the Ugandan police had rounded up civilians who complained about corruption . His government has threatened to execute gay people , though a bill in Parliament calling for that has yet to be resolved. Seven others are running for president, and the problem for Uganda’s opposition, just like that in other African countries that are beginning to experiment with democracy, is that it is rudderless and divided. The stiffest competition Mr. Museveni faces is from his old comrade Kizza Besigye , a retired army colonel who has run twice before and lost, though he claimed fraud. Mr. Besigye, who seems to be a bit of a loose cannon on the campaign trail, predicted Egypt-style riots. (He has also intimated that Uganda was better off under Idi Amin.) He warned that Mr. Museveni’s government had “created these conditions of oppression and despondency, conditions of frustration, unemployment, that can lead to violence.” Ugandan human rights groups say that the leading political parties have organized young people into militias, a troubling sign. Another worry is if the election is close and the government tries to rig the results to stay in power, then people could rise up. That seemed to be the case in Kenya in 2007, plunging that country into a violent crisis. The unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has sent a few tendrils to other parts of Africa, though the relatively small protests in Sudan, Djibouti and Gabon were quickly crushed. The Ugandan security forces are out in force. On Thursday, the day before the election, squads of officers prowled the streets, swinging batons and carrying guns. Protests are one fear; a terrorist attack is another. Uganda has thousands of peacekeepers in Somalia, and Somali terrorists bombed crowds in Kampala last summer, killing scores . That seems to be the biggest question — whether this election will pass incident-free, not so much who will win.",

    "source": "Supreme Court Ruling Counters Pennsylvania Judge on Recusal <eos> WASHINGTON — A judge may not hear an appeal in a death penalty case that he worked on as a prosecutor, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday in a 5-to-3 decision. The court also issued divided decisions in two other cases, ruling that Puerto Rico cannot try defendants in local courts for conduct already prosecuted in federal court, and that discharged juries may be called back in some cases to fix mistakes in their verdicts . Recusal The death penalty case concerned Ronald D. Castille, who was Philadelphia’s district attorney in 1986 when he authorized the capital prosecution of Terrance Williams. Mr. Williams and a friend, both 18, were accused of killing Amos Norwood, 56, with a tire iron. “Approved to proceed on the death penalty,” Mr. Castille wrote on a subordinate’s memorandum. Mr. Williams was convicted and sentenced to death. Later, when Mr. Castille was running for a seat on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, he said he was reluctant to take a firm public position on the death penalty, fearing it would require his recusal from all capital cases. “I can certainly say I sent 45 people to death row as district attorney of Philadelphia,” he told a legal newspaper in 1993, adding that voters “sort of get the hint.” Mr. Williams was the first of those 45. In 2012, as the court’s chief justice, Mr. Castille denied a request from Mr. Williams’s lawyers that he disqualify himself from hearing an appeal based on claims of prosecutorial misconduct by the office he had led. Although a lower court had accepted the claims, Mr. Castille, about two weeks before he retired at the end of 2014, joined a unanimous decision reinstating Mr. Williams’s death sentence. In an interview , Mr. Castille said his role in the case as district attorney had been merely administrative. “I didn’t try the case,” he said. “I wasn’t really involved in the case except as the leader of the office.” On Thursday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said Mr. Castille’s participation in the case required his recusal. “Chief Justice Castille’s significant, personal involvement in a critical decision in Williams’s case gave rise to an unacceptable risk of actual bias,” Justice Kennedy wrote. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the majority decision in the case, Williams v. Pennsylvania, No. 15-5040. The court ordered the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to rehear Mr. Williams’s appeal. Justice Kennedy said the Constitution’s due process clause guarantees that “no man can be a judge in his own case.” In dissent, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that “the majority opinion rests on proverb rather than precedent.” “The due process clause did not prohibit Chief Justice Castille from hearing Williams’s case,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. “That does not mean, however, that it was appropriate for him to do so,” as recusal might have been required under state law and ethics rules. “It is up to state authorities — not this court — to determine whether recusal should be required,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined Chief Justice Roberts’s dissent. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate dissent, saying that “the specter of bias alone in a judicial proceeding is not a deprivation of due process.” How a Vacancy on the Supreme Court Affected Cases in the 2015-16 Term The empty seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia’s death leaves the court with two basic options for cases left on the docket this term if the justices are deadlocked at 4 to 4. _____ Double Jeopardy In a narrow decision steeped in history, the court ruled, 6 to 2, that Puerto Rico is not a separate sovereign for purposes of the Constitution’s double jeopardy clause, which forbids subsequent prosecutions for the same crimes. The Supreme Court has said that the federal government and the states are independent sovereigns, meaning that the same conduct can be prosecuted separately in state and federal courts. Puerto Rico lacks such authority, the court ruled on Thursday in Puerto Rico v. Sánchez Valle, No. 15-108, addressing a deeply contested matter of politics and pride. The case concerned Luis M. Sánchez Valle and Gómez Vázquez, who were prosecuted on gun charges in local and federal courts in Puerto Rico. They pleaded guilty to the federal charges and asserted that they could not be prosecuted for the same crimes in local courts under the Constitution’s double jeopardy clause. Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court agreed. “Puerto Rico’s authority to prosecute individuals is derived from its delegation by United States Congress and not by virtue of its own sovereignty,” the court’s majority said. In an opinion affirming that judgment on Thursday, Justice Kagan said Puerto Rico does as a contemporary matter have many important attributes of sovereignty. Since Puerto Rico became a territory in 1898, she wrote, “the United States and Puerto Rico have forged a unique political relationship, built on the island’s evolution into a constitutional democracy exercising local self-rule.” But she said the legal test for analyzing the double jeopardy question was a historical one and that the commonwealth failed it. “For purposes of the double jeopardy clause, the future is not what matters — and there is no getting away from the past,” Justice Kagan wrote. “Because the ultimate source of Puerto Rico’s prosecutorial power is the federal government — because when we trace that authority all the way back, we arrive at the doorstep of the U.S. Capitol — the commonwealth and the United States are not separate sovereigns.” Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Kennedy, Ginsburg and Alito joined the majority opinion, and Justice Thomas for the most part concurred in it. Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Sotomayor, dissented, saying that the majority’s test was too narrow and mechanical, and that it failed to grapple with all of the historical evidence. _____ Discharged Juries The court also ruled, 6 to 2, that federal judges in civil cases may sometimes recall jurors they have discharged for further deliberations after discovering that their verdict did not make sense. The case, Dietz v. Bouldin, No. 15-458, arose from a car crash in Bozeman, Mont., in which all sides agreed that the plaintiff was owed at least $10,136. But the jury, apparently assuming that the sum had already been paid, awarded nothing. A few minutes after the jurors left the courtroom, the judge ordered them to come back for more deliberations, and they eventually awarded $15,000. Justice Sotomayor, writing for the majority, said that recalling the jurors had been permissible, though she cautioned that judges should be wary of long delays, ask whether jurors had spoken to outsiders, and not use the procedure if the verdict had given rise to “gasps, crying, cheering” and the like. In dissent, Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Kennedy, said there should be a categorical rule against ever recalling discharged jurors. “After discharge,” Justice Thomas wrote, “the court has no power to impose restrictions on jurors, and jurors are no longer under oath to obey them.” “Jurors may access their cellphones and get public information about the case,” he said. “They may talk to counsel or the parties. They may overhear comments in the hallway as they leave the courtroom. And they may reflect on the case — away from the pressure of the jury room — in a way that could induce them to change their minds. The resulting prejudice can be hard to detect.”",

    "source": "2 Wall Street Employees Charged With Insider Trading <eos> Ever since Michael Douglas declared that \"greed is good\" in the 1987 movie \"Wall Street,\" the character he played, Gordon Gekko, has been the face of insider trading on Wall Street. But it was $2 million in profits made by a 63-year-old retired seamstress in Croatia that tipped off the Securities and Exchange Commission about an ambitious and unusually creative insider trading ring, investigators say. That lead culminated in the arrests yesterday of two junior-level employees at Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. The seamstress, Sonja Anticevic, made more than $2 million -- a seventeenfold return -- on a two-day investment in options on Reebok International after the company announced last August it would be acquired by Adidas-Salomon and the stock surged 30 percent. Regulators say it was her nephew, David Pajcin, a 29-year-old former Goldman Sachs bond research analyst, who made the trades. They said he was working with Stanislav Shpigelman, 23, an analyst in Merrill Lynch's mergers and acquisitions department, and Eugene Plotkin, a 26-year-old Harvard graduate who was an associate in the Goldman Sachs bond research department until he was suspended yesterday. The three engaged in a scheme that Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney in Manhattan, described as \"one of the most extensive insider trading cases in this district in decades.\" Bail for Mr. Shpigelman and Mr. Plotkin was set at $3 million each; both remained in custody late yesterday. Mr. Pajcin was released on bail in November. Insider trading has long been a scourge of Wall Street. But, as described by prosecutors, the efforts by Mr. Plotkin, Mr. Pajcin and Mr. Shpigelman were notable for their brashness and far-reaching nature. One scheme was old-fashioned: Mr. Plotkin and Mr. Pajcin, who met as young bond researchers at Goldman, recruited Mr. Shpigelman to provide them with information about deals Merrill Lynch was working on. The three men also placed online ads and later recruited two employees who worked at a private printing plant in Hartford, Wis., where Business Week magazine is printed, according to investigators. According to the charges against two employees there, Juan Renteria, 20, of Milwaukee and Nickolaus Shuster, 24, now of Lexington, Tenn., stole advance copies of the magazine and gave Mr. Plotkin and Mr. Pajcin the names of stocks mentioned in the \"Inside Wall Street\" column, information which, if favorable, often sends the prices of those stocks up. Mr. Renteria was arrested yesterday; Mr. Shuster had been charged earlier. The defendants netted $6.4 million by trading on information about deals including Adidas-Salomon's acquisition of Reebok International and Proctor & Gamble's purchase of Gillette, the complaints say. The Business Week scheme was less profitable; the defendants made $345,000, the S.E.C said. Mark Schonfeld, director of the S.E.C.'s Northeast regional office, said the defendants contemplated other innovative ways to obtain insider information, including using exotic dancers to glean information from investment bankers. A dancer, Monika Vujovic, 23, of New York, allowed the defendants to set up an account for her in which illegal trades were made, according to the S.E.C. complaint, which charges her. Her lawyer, Mel A. Sachs, said he was confident that the accusations against his client would be favorably resolved in court. Mr. Plotkin and Mr. Pajcin met when the two worked together at Goldman Sachs in 2000. Mr. Pajcin left the firm five months after he started. In 2004, the two started to plot ways to obtain inside information, the complaint says. \"He's an intelligent person with a depth of character that makes you wonder about these charges,\" a lawyer for Mr. Plotkin, Martin L. Schmukler, said. Mr. Plotkin met Mr. Shpigelman, when Mr. Shpigelman was trying to get a job on Wall Street. In July 2004, Mr. Shpigelman became an analyst in Merrill's mergers and acquisitions department. Mr. Shpigelman seemed aware that information about deals was secret, according to an e-mail message cited in the S.E.C. complaint. In response to a question about whether a deal he had mentioned was public, he wrote, \"Yes, the offer is public. I would not be telling you, especially via e-mail, unless I wanted to chill with Martha in Connecticut for a little while,\" referring to Martha Stewart, who was convicted of obstruction of justice in an insider trading investigation. A lawyer for Mr. Shpigelman, Katherine L. Pringle, did not return calls for comment. Youth may have fueled the plotters' fearlessness. The three originally traded in their own accounts but later opened accounts in other people's names, simultaneously setting up a network of people around the world with whom they shared inside information in return for 50 percent of the profit. The S.E.C. named 13 of those people in its civil complaint, including Mikhail Plotkin, Mr. Plotkin's father. Even after the S.E.C. filed a complaint against Mr. Pajcin in August 2005, Mr. Plotkin continued to trade on illegal information from the Business Week printing plant. Both Mr. Pajcin and Mr. Plotkin also destroyed their computers and cellphones, but continued to talk about how to evade law enforcement efforts, according to the S.E.C. complaint. When, after fleeing to the Dominican Republic and Cuba, Mr. Pajcin returned to the United States to give a deposition, perhaps in an attempt to get his bank accounts unfrozen, he lied about his participation in both schemes, the S.E.C. complaint says. He was arrested soon afterward and charged with illegal insider trading. Mr. Pajcin's lawyer, Paul G. Lieber, did not return a call for comment. The case was first uncovered by the S.E.C. last year. Immediately after Adidas-Salomon announced it had a deal to acquire Reebok, sending Reebok's stock up 30 percent, the market surveillance department in Washington detected an unusual volume of trading in Reebok call options, which allow an investor to lock in a price to buy the stock. Within 24 hours, investigators traced the trading to Croatia and Ms. Anticevic. \"Ms. Anticevic, it seemed, was either the most successful investor in the history of Wall Street or part of something more nefarious,\" Mr. Schonfeld of the S.E.C. said. Jonathan Kaye, a lawyer for Ms. Anticevic, denied that any insider trading took place. \"This was done with research done from her nephew,\" he said. The investigation led to Ms. Anticevic's nephew, Mr. Pajcin, revealing the expansive efforts by Mr. Pajcin and Mr. Plotkin to find information and trade on it. Mr. Pajcin is cooperating with regulators. \"These allegations, if true, represent a serious breach of trust and violation of Merrill Lynch's fundamental principles,\" said a Merrill Lynch spokesman, Mark Herr. \"We do not tolerate or condone insider trading.\" A Goldman Sachs spokesman said the firm would continue to cooperate with the investigation. Neither firm is a target of investigators.",

    "source": "Karachi Heat Wave Death Toll Tops 650 During Ramadan Fast <eos> KARACHI, Pakistan — Karachi’s poor learned long ago to cope with the many adversities that afflict Pakistan’s most crowded and chaotic city, including flooding, street violence and political crises. But since a suffocating heat wave descended on Karachi three days ago, killing at least 650 people, they have found no respite and no escape. “It’s so hot,” said a security guard, Shamim ur-Rehman, 34, as he sat on a cot, looking beleaguered. “There is no fan, there is nothing. I can’t sleep at night or during the day.” Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif declared an emergency on Tuesday as the death toll from the heat wave soared, with overwhelmed hospitals struggling to treat a surge of casualties and morgues filling to capacity. The army set up emergency treatment centers in the streets and the provincial government closed schools and city offices. The Edhi Foundation , which runs an ambulance service and Karachi’s largest morgue, said it had collected over 600 bodies in recent days. “The first to die were the people on the streets — heroin addicts, beggars, the homeless,” said Anwar Kazmi, a spokesman for the service. “Then it was the elderly, particularly those who didn’t have anyone to take care of them.” In many ways, the emergency is the product of a perfect storm of meteorological, political and religious factors in Karachi. Chronic shortages of water and electricity have exacerbated the impact of the heat wave, which has brought temperatures up to 45 degrees Celsius, or 113 degrees Fahrenheit, in a crowded city of 20 million people that is normally ventilated by a sea breeze. The health dangers are further exacerbated by the demands of the annual Ramadan fast, when most Muslims abstain from eating or drinking water during daylight hours. For most people, that means about 15 hours with no source of hydration — a factor that has particularly affected manual laborers and street vendors, who work outside under the sun. Dr. Seemin Jamali, head of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center emergency wing, said 272 people had died there from heat-related conditions, including dehydration. The smaller Abbasi Shaheed Hospital said 56 bodies had been brought in since Monday night. Officials said a majority of the victims were men over the age of 50, especially day laborers from lower-income groups. Although Karachi residents are used to dealing with other emergencies — stockpiling groceries, for example, during bouts of street violence — they seemed at a loss for how to manage the extended heat wave. The electricity shortages are the product of decades-long mismanagement of Pakistan’s national grid, and are often worse at dusk when many people are cooking in preparation for the end of the fast. Image En route to a hospital on Tuesday in Karachi, where extreme heat has killed hundreds. Credit Shakil Adil/Associated Press Not only do the power cuts make air-conditioning units and ceiling fans useless — they also reduce the water supply by shutting down pumps. Ice is in short supply and being sold for a premium in many neighborhoods. As the death toll rose over the weekend, many residents opted to stay indoors or to congregate at centrally air-conditioned malls. But that was not a choice for laborers, who make as little as $10 a day and try to keep themselves cool by wrapping wet towels around their heads to stave off the sun. Political anger over the crisis focused on the government of Mr. Sharif, who had pledged to reduce the energy crisis when he came to power two years ago. Syed Qaim Ali Shah, the chief minister of Sindh Province, which includes Karachi, blamed the federal government for failing to get better results from K-Electric, the private company that runs the city’s electricity supply. Mr. Sharif’s officials dismissed that criticism and tried to turn the blame back on Mr. Shah. Addressing Parliament in the capital, Islamabad, Khawaja Asif, the national minister for water and power, insisted he had no direct control over K-Electric. On the streets, people blamed politicians of all stripes. Over the past year, Mr. Sharif’s government has frequently appeared impotent during moments of crisis. By contrast, the powerful military, led by Gen. Raheel Sharif, has become an increasingly assertive force in public life. Amid the political finger-pointing, some news media commentators called on politicians to voluntarily cut off their own electricity and experience the hardship endured by ordinary people. Some journalists fell victim to the heat, too, like a cameraman who fainted during an official news conference in Karachi on Tuesday afternoon.

Credit Akhtar Soomro/Reuters Most residents concentrated on escaping the suffocating heat. Television coverage showed residents fleeing their flats to seek shelter in the open streets. “We try and sit in the shade,” said Mohammad Yusuf, 32, a laborer who works on a moving crew with a pickup truck. “We went all the way near the port today and sat under a tree for three hours.” At Jinnah Hospital, Dr. Jamali said members of her staff had treated more than 5,000 patients from Saturday to Monday. The heat, not the fasting, was the principal factor in the deaths, she said. Although many continued to fast, others quietly allowed that they were unable to cope with the demands of their faith. Subah Sadiq, a fruit vendor and father of seven, said it was impossible to stand in the street all day without drinking. “This is the only way to survive,” he said. Even for those not fasting, staying hydrated is a challenge: Under Pakistani law, in public places, eating and drinking are illegal during Ramadan, although some clerics said their followers could break the fast if their health was in danger. Mr. Rehman, the building watchman, was refusing to give up. “As long as I have some life in me, and strong intentions, I will fast,” he said. One small glimmer of good news came from the weather service. Although hot weather is forecast to continue through this week, officials said, a small amount of rainfall was predicted for Karachi and surrounding cities for late Tuesday night.",

    "source": "Rebels Chase Congo Troops, as Fighting Kills U.N. Peacekeeper <eos> NAIROBI, Kenya — Hundreds of soldiers from the army of the Democratic Republic of Congo fled across the border into Uganda on Friday, in an embarrassing retreat from rebel forces. A United Nations peacekeeper was killed in the fighting, the latest instability to hit the war-wracked eastern Congo. Ugandan troops immediately stripped the approximately 600 Congolese soldiers of their guns and ammunition and the Ugandan government was trying to figure out what to do with them. “They have been disarmed, and they are with us,” said Capt. Peter Mugisa of the Ugandan Army. “We will see how to handle that matter.” The unusual cross-border retreat was a blow to Congo’s troops, who have been bested several times in the past few weeks by a new rebel group called the March 23 Movement or M23. United Nations investigators and others have accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels , but Rwanda has vehemently denied this. Some diplomats in Nairobi said the connections were murky, and though Rwanda has supported Congolese rebels before, the evidence this time may not be so clear-cut. The M23 group emerged this spring when Congo’s government decided to act on a longstanding arrest warrant for Gen. Bosco Ntaganda, a former rebel leader who had briefly been part of the Congolese Army and who stands accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court. The prospect of arrest set off a mutiny by General Ntaganda’s followers within the army, and since then, the M23 has seized a string of small towns. On Thursday and Friday, Congo’s Army clashed with the rebels around the town of Bunagana, on the Congo-Uganda border. By dawn on Friday, the rebels won and the soldiers from Congo retreated into Uganda along with several thousand refugees. During the exchange of fire, one Indian peacekeeper working for the United Nations in Bunagana was killed. Analysts say the M23 is not especially interested in trying to overthrow Congo’s government, but want to carve out a sphere of influence in eastern Congo, which is teeming with minerals, and use their territorial gains as bargaining chips. Similar rebellions have plagued eastern Congo for more than a decade. The American military has been working more closely with some Congo Army units in recent years trying to make them more professional and battle-tough, but the latest episode is a sign of the lack of training within the ranks. On Friday, two Congolese Army spokesmen declined to discuss recent events. One of them said that he was under strict orders not to speak to foreign journalists.",

    "source": "Traditional Exchanges Duel With Newcomers Over Trade Transparency <eos> While most people trading stocks at home imagine their orders zipping from their brokers onto one of the nation’s stock exchanges, almost none of the trades go anywhere near those public markets. In reality, most trades placed through online brokers like TD Ameritrade and Scottrade are sold to Wall Street firms, which accumulate and trade against tens of millions of these shares a day, rather than send them to a regulated exchange like Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange . The Wall Street firms then quickly flip them and turn an easy profit because they have more resources and market knowledge than mom-and-pop investors. The trading, which takes place away from the gaze of regulators and the public in what are known as the dark markets, has taken off in recent years and steadily eaten into the portion of all stock trading that takes place on the public exchanges. Now, though, the exchanges are fighting back by looking to create dark markets of their own. NYSE Euronext , the company that owns the exchange, is asking regulators to approve a new platform that would attract orders from ordinary investors and then divert them away from the normal exchange with the aim of getting the investor a better price. Nasdaq and the exchange company Direct Edge said they have similar plans in the works. The proposal looks like a technical tweak to help ordinary investors. But it has become the front line in a battle over what the nation’s stock markets should look like after nearly a decade of fragmentation has resulted in over a third of all stock trades occurring in the dark, up from 15 percent in 2008, according to Rosenblatt Securities, a brokerage firm. In the past, the exchanges have pushed regulators to force the dark markets to become better lit, but James Allen, the head of capital markets policy for the CFA Institute, said that with the new proposals the exchanges are acknowledging “that if you can’t beat them, join them.” In doing so, they are ready to take a turn away from the idea of stock exchanges as places where all investors come together in the open and on equal footing. “It could forever change what an exchange is and how it serves different factions of investors,” said Christopher Nagy, the founder of KOR Trading, a firm that advises exchanges and brokers. “This proposal essentially says maybe not all people are equal.” The regulators have until July 7 to decide on the New York Stock Exchange proposal, and it is far from certain that it will win approval. But industry insiders say that even if it is rejected, the plans are forcing regulators to decide how they will deal with the vast transformation of the nation’s stock markets in the last few years. Since a crucial regulatory change was made in 2007, the nation has gone from having two major stock exchanges to having 13 public exchanges, as well as dozens of trading platforms where stocks are traded away from the public eye. Regulators have not stood in the way of these changes, but they have expressed their discomfort with the complex current market structure, and their uncertainty about how to deal with it. Duncan L. Niederauer, the chief executive of NYSE Euronext, said in a Congressional hearing last Wednesday that the operators of off-exchange trading platforms are under less stringent oversight than the exchanges. He said that regulators should either tighten the rules on dark trading platforms or let the exchanges look more like those platforms. The competition among platforms is credited with bringing down the cost of trading for investors of all types. But the fragmentation of the markets is also blamed for making the market infrastructure more prone to break down, as it did in the flash crash of May 2010, when stock prices plunged nearly 10 percent in 15 minutes. It happened again when the Nasdaq exchange botched the initial public offering of Facebook in May. The rise of the dark markets has also fed concerns about whether the prices of stocks can be manipulated more easily. The practice of diverting retail shares away from public markets and into financial firms is called “internalization.” Bernard L. Madoff is credited with inventing the practice in the early 1990s through his legitimate trading firm, which was on a different floor from his Ponzi investment scheme. Mr. Madoff realized that his firm had better indications of which way stocks were moving than did the retail investors. If his traders could see that shares in a particular company were about to tick up, they could quickly buy shares from a retail trader offering the shares at a slightly lower price and then turn around and immediately sell them for the higher price. The profits made it worth it to pay retail brokers to get the orders. The practice took off after a series of regulatory changes over the last decade made it easier to trade off exchanges and more expensive to trade on exchanges. Today, four firms — Knight Capital Group, UBS, Citigroup and Citadel — have made a business out of paying for retail trades and trading against them. These firms generally pay retail brokers 15 cents for every 100 shares they are sent to trade against, industry experts say. The internalizers were caught in the Facebook initial public offering. They paid to trade against all retail investors clamoring for Facebook shares, but when the Nasdaq exchange broke down just as trading opened, they were left holding the shares. Knight Capital has said it lost around $35 million in the incident. Some critics say that internalization is a problem because the payments the brokers receive are not passed along to the customers. The internalizers also create an incentive for retail brokers to send orders to the place where they can get the biggest payment, rather than the trading platform providing the best price. The retail brokers contend that the internalizers allow them to get the quickest and best execution for their customers. Exchanges have struggled to compete with internalizers because they are not allowed to trade at any price other than the publicly listed price, which is what ordinary investors see when they look at stock prices online. Internalizing firms and other players in dark markets can offer to provide a better price, even if it is just a fraction of a penny. The internalizers will execute the trade only if their market intelligence tells them that the market is about to move in their favor, allowing them to quickly flip the trade. If the internalizers don’t want to trade against the order themselves they usually circulate it to other brokers and dark pools. Only the hardest retail orders to handle — what the exchanges refer to as “toxic order flow” — make it to the exchanges. The NYSE Euronext plan would offer to segment retail orders into a sequestered area where registered firms could offer to trade at a price slightly better than the listed price. The orders to buy and sell would not be visible to the public. Nasdaq has not unveiled its plan but people with direct knowledge said it would look somewhat similar and involve a mini-auction any time a retail order came in. Some internalizing firms have expressed opposition to the plans of the exchanges. But the proposals have also come under fire from market watchers who worry about the direction the industry is taking. Mr. Allen of the CFA Institute, which represents investors, said he understands that the exchanges need to be able to compete, but he does not want to see them accelerate the movement of markets into the dark. “We want whatever comes out of this to be more transparent rather than less transparent,” he said.",

    "source": "Syracuse Holds On to Early Lead and Beats Georgetown <eos> SYRACUSE — With eight minutes remaining in Saturday’s men’s basketball game between Syracuse and Georgetown, the manager of the Carrier Dome came tapping on the shoulders of all the reporters on press row. “If Syracuse wins there’s a very good chance the students are going to rush the court,” he said. “So be ready for that.” With two minutes left, the reporters packed up their laptops. And with less than one to go, the herd of students in orange and blue took over the tables, grinning at the court in front of them. As paint-covered bodies hurdled through the bleachers, the message was clear: All is well in Syracuse again. A loss Wednesday night to last-place South Florida seemed the lowest of lows — improbable if not impossible to bounce back from. But the Orange (17-9 over all, 7-6 Big East) learned quickly that beating No. 8 Georgetown (20-4, 10-3) could alleviate all that pain. Even as the Hoyas sliced a second-half deficit to 5 from 19, Syracuse held on strong for a 77-70 victory in front of 31,327, the largest on-campus crowd this season. The Orange came out fighting, playing body-to-body defense against some of the most physical players in the conference. Syracuse held Georgetown to a season-low 22 first-half points and was fueled by a balanced offense similar to what the Orange displayed in a victory at Villanova on Feb. 2. The Orange led by 38-22 at halftime, having forced 12 Georgetown turnovers. Even when offensive problems hit during the latter half, Syracuse’s intensity never subsided. When the Hoyas cut the lead to 5, the Orange stormed back courtesy of a 3-pointer by the freshman forward Donte Greene. The sophomore guard Paul Harris led Syracuse with 22 points, sinking 7 of 8 free throws down the stretch. Greene added 18 and Jonny Flynn had 17. Jonathan Wallace led Georgetown with 26 points. MEMPHIS AIMS FOR PERFECTION Unless you have been living under a rock in the shape of a basketball, you know top-ranked Memphis is the lone unbeaten men’s team left in N.C.A.A. Division I. Through Friday’s games, there were still five teams that had yet to lose a conference game this season: Memphis in Conference USA, Duke in the Atlantic Coast Conference, Cornell in the Ivy League, Davidson in the Southern Conference and Oral Roberts in the Summit League. Memphis is looking for its second straight 16-0 season in Conference USA. The last team to have back-to-back unbeaten conference seasons was Princeton in the Ivy League in 1996-97 and 1997-98. Winthrop of the Big South was the only other college to go unbeaten in conference play last season. There have been at least two teams to run the conference table every season since 2001-2, when only Kansas of the Big 12 did it. The last time there were not any was 2000-1. On the negative side, there were five teams through Friday’s games that had yet to win a conference game: North Florida in the Atlantic Sun, Northwestern in the Big Ten, Rice in Conference USA, Colorado State in the Mountain West and Oregon State in the Pacific-10. No team went winless in league play last season, although six managed only one conference victory. (AP) ROOM TO GROW U.C.L.A.’s Kevin Love knows he is not fooling anyone with his listed height of 6 feet 10 inches. Love, the 271-pound freshman sensation, insists he has always claimed to be 6-9. But with his shoes off, he has been measured at 6-8 ½. With shoes on, he is 6-9 ½. “The whole height thing is really overrated,” he said. “When it comes down to it, can you play or can you not play? I think I play like I’m 7 feet.” Now 19, Love said doctors told him he would continue growing until he is 21. “Sometime, I could really be 6-10,” he said. (AP)",

    "source": "Malone Had Plan for a Role as Icahn Moved on Time Warner <eos> It turns out that John C. Malone was interested in capitalizing on Carl C. Icahn's planned proxy fight at Time Warner, as well. Mr. Malone, the media investor, applied to regulators to have a nonvoting 4 percent stake in Time Warner owned by his Liberty Media Corporation converted into voting shares a year ahead of schedule. In a news release, the company's incoming chief executive, Gregory B. Maffei, said the company was looking to \"participate actively in key shareholder votes and actions.\" But Mr. Malone had hoped to get voting control of his shares while the proxy challenge was still on. \"We did the filing before Icahn went away,\" said John Orr, a spokesman for Liberty. He would not say whether Liberty had any further proposals for Time Warner. The filing landed after last week's settlement between an investor group led by Mr. Icahn and Time Warner. In exchange for various concessions, including an increased share buyback and the appointment of two new independent directors, Mr. Icahn called off the planned proxy fight. Mr. Maffei said that the company was pleased with the steps taken by Time Warner, but looked forward to \"additional actions.\" A Time Warner spokesman said the deadline had now passed for shareholders to nominate board members for the company's annual meeting in May, as Mr. Icahn had threatened to do in pursuit of a plan to break up the company. Liberty said it had applied to the Federal Trade Commission for the right to convert the shares ahead of a prohibition barring them from voting status until February 2007. The restriction was put in place a decade ago as part of the approval for the acquisition of Turner Broadcasting Systems -- in which Mr. Malone was a large investor -- by Time Warner. At the time, Liberty was a subsidiary of Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable television operator. Because Time Warner also operates a large cable television business, approval of the deal was contingent on Mr. Malone's having no say over Time Warner's affairs for 10 years. Liberty could have made the same request of the trade commission at any point after the successor to TCI was sold to the Comcast Corporation in 2003 and Mr. Malone ceased to play a role in the company. One person close to Time Warner suggested that Mr. Malone might be seeking leverage over the company for a future transaction with Liberty, although a Time Warner spokesman said none had been proposed. The only direct commercial interest between the companies is a joint venture that owns the Court TV television network. Liberty, which has a range of media interests and investments, is pursuing a strategy of becoming more of an operating company. Mr. Malone's tactics with Time Warner are reminiscent of the approach he took toward the News Corporation, another large media company that Liberty invested in. Liberty had been a nonvoting shareholder in that company, but Mr. Malone swapped his shares for an 18 percent voting stake in November 2004, causing a rift with his sometimes partner Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation chairman, who controls 29.5 percent of the company's votes. That prompted Mr. Murdoch to put in place a poison pill takeover defense to keep Mr. Malone from raising his stake. That pill is being challenged by other shareholders in Delaware Chancery Court. At a 4 percent voting stake, Liberty would be among the largest individual shareholders of the widely held Time Warner. Mr. Icahn and three hedge funds allied with him hold 3.3 percent. Separately, Fitch Ratings downgraded Time Warner's bonds one notch, from BBB+ to BBB, because of the additional debt the company is expected to take on from its newly planned $20 billion share buyback and its acquistion of Adelphia Communications. \"Our actions really reflect the more aggressive financial tendencies of Time Warner and what we think is the heightened risk of further revisions to their capital allocation strategy,\" said Brendan Buckley, an analyst with Fitch.",

    "source": "After a Loss, Siblings Try to Reconnect <eos> Silence has settled where animated banter and familial laughter were once the norm. The dynamic between Jasmine Morales, 25, and the two siblings who live with her has been thrown off kilter. In September 2012, the three of them lost their mother, Iris Roman, who developed sepsis after having surgery to remove kidney stones. Ms. Morales said she was in the process of consulting with a lawyer about a lawsuit. The more pressing order of business for Ms. Morales, her half-sister Desiree Roman, 22, and her half-brother Johantzen Valdez, 18, has been mustering the strength to weather the past year and a half. Their loss further hampers lives that were already marred by poverty and mental illness. At age 13, Desiree Roman received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. She takes medication, but said it had nonetheless been difficult to balance her health and her grief. “One minute I’m all happy and jolly, the next minute I’m creeping people out,” she said. “I try to be brave, but it doesn’t work.” Her dual conditions have left her unable to work, she said. Ms. Roman had been collecting monthly Social Security disability payments, but those were stopped recently after doctors decided that she was no longer disabled; she said she was trying to get them back. Neither of the other siblings in the household work, either. Mr. Valdez is in his senior year of high school, with hopes of going to college and studying business. Ms. Morales said she had been looking for a job for months. She left Hostos Community College, where she had been pursuing a degree in early childhood education, to commit herself to the search. “The only people who want me or have contacted me are people who want money for training,” she said. The family does not have the money to pay such costs. The family receives $499 in food stamps and $194 in cash each month. The monthly rent of $312 for their Bronx apartment is covered by public assistance. Their mother, with her own mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder, had not worked, but had encouraged her children’s sense of responsibility. “She didn’t raise us to rely on others,” Mr. Valdez said. “She kind of raised us to push forth and be yourself, by yourself.” Circumstances have made it hard for the siblings to follow that advice. All three siblings receive psychological counseling from East Side House Settlement, a nonprofit organization with programs serving children and families. All three admit that their once-strong bond has been worn away by sorrow. “Since my mom passed, we’ve been separated from each other,” Mr. Valdez said. They all agree that they prefer the solitude of separate rooms to communal gatherings, which remind them that something important is missing. However, brother and sisters do manage to come together on occasion, particularly on holidays and the anniversary of their mother’s death. “I want to feel more like a family and not roommates,” Ms. Roman said. On a recent visit to the home, an East Side House caseworker noticed that the apartment was lacking in furniture, and that what was there was broken. The Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, provided the siblings with $1,700 from the fund for new beds and living room furniture. There are two older siblings whom the three see regularly, as well as other family members they are not close with. Ms. Morales, Ms. Roman and Mr. Valdez each concede that it often seems as if it is three of them against the new world. “I fear us not being successful and relying on public assistance,” Mr. Valdez said. “I fear staying where we are and not becoming better.”",

    "source": "A Tablet for Children That Comes With Its Own Penguins <eos> GLENDALE, Calif. — DreamWorks Animation first captivated children in movie theaters. Then it branched into TV, piping cartoons based on hits like “Madagascar” and “How to Train Your Dragon” into homes through outlets like Nickelodeon and Netflix. Now DreamWorks has partnered with a technology company, Fuhu, on an even more immediate way to reach itty-bitty eyeballs, a highly coveted audience: a tablet computer for children that the studio will be able to program much like a cable channel. “We could push out a new character moment every day of the year,” said Jim Mainard, head of digital strategy and new business development for DreamWorks. DreamWorks and Fuhu, which makes the popular Nabi line of children’s tablets, plan to introduce the product, called the DreamTab, at the International Consumer Electronics Show, which starts Tuesday in Las Vegas. The tablets will be sold with a range of DreamWorks-branded accessories, including headphones, protective bumpers and carrying cases. An eight-inch version of the DreamTab will arrive in stores in the spring. Pricing is still being determined but it will be under $300, a Fuhu spokesman said. A 12-inch version is also planned. The partnership is a convergence of two business trends. With children as young as 2 or 3 now routinely using their parents’ iPads or smartphones — if the toddlers don’t already have their own — technology companies are racing to introduce gadgets made for smaller and smaller hands. Fuhu itself sold more than two million Nabis in 2013, and its tablets, which are primarily designed for children 6 to 11, now collectively deliver more than 20 million video streams a week. Entertainment companies have been surprised at how speedily children have taken to tablets, sometimes forgoing TV sets altogether. As a result, DreamWorks, Disney and their competitors are searching for ways to make it easier for users to find their characters on portable devices. Fuhu’s strategic goal with the DreamTab is differentiation — coming up with a way to persuade parents to buy its product over a competing one. DreamWorks is hoping to find a new way into the home, deepening its reputation as an innovative content creator and funneling more viewers to its programs and movies and selling more merchandise. “By teaming with DreamWorks to create a device that will have original content — original content that is automatically and frequently updated — we are not following consumers, we are getting ahead of them,” said Jim Mitchell, Fuhu’s chief executive. There are all sorts of branded tablets, of course. Fuhu in October introduced a special-edition Disney Nabi and Nickelodeon Nabi. But neither of those offered original and exclusive programming like the DreamTab will. Unlike some other tablets, the DreamTab will not lock children into a DreamWorks-only world. The studio’s video content and games are the most prominent, but users can also stream shows from Nickelodeon, Disney and Cartoon Network. Nancy Bernstein, a movie producer who is in charge of creating what she calls “character moments” for the DreamTab, insists that the effort is not simply an advertising opportunity for the studio. Turn on the tablet, for instance, and penguins from the “Madagascar” franchise might greet you with a silly dance. Depending on how parents have set the timing controls, “Shrek” characters might appear in a skit to announce that it is time to power down. “All of this animation was custom-created,” Ms. Bernstein said in a demonstration at DreamWorks’s headquarters here. Some parents might disagree with her definition of advertising. Will dancing penguins make DreamTab users more interested in seeing “The Penguins of Madagascar” when it arrives in theaters next year? The studio, led by Jeffrey Katzenberg, would be naïve not to hope the answer is yes. The DreamTab will also have technology that allows it to communicate wirelessly with DreamWorks-made toys. For instance, a “How to Train Your Dragon” action figure might be used to unlock games and educational experiences on the tablet. (The studio’s “How to Train Your Dragon 2” arrives in June.) The companies will try to woo parents by including educational elements. In addition to original animation, DreamWorks will supply what it calls “educational artistic experiences”; some of the studio’s top animators will appear in videos to teach users how to draw characters like Po the panda or Toothless the dragon. To allow children to draw on the screens, each DreamTab will come with the same stylus technology that DreamWorks artists use to make movies. “We want to transform the way kids play, learn and grow through technology,” said Mr. Mitchell of Fuhu, which is based in El Segundo, Calif. The DreamTab’s technology is quite hefty. The devices will enable children to send instant messages and emails to their parents’ smartphones, for instance. Mr. Mitchell emphasized that his company had gone to “incredible lengths” to make the DreamTab compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act , a federal law that restricts the ways that companies collect information on children under 13. The DreamTab is not a toy. Switched into parent mode, it provides roughly the same computing power as an iPad, the companies said. “If you give a kid less, they will spot it immediately as less, and they won’t like it,” said Mr. Mainard of DreamWorks. “We wanted to give more.”",

    "source": "News Corp. Has a Tablet for Schools <eos> For nearly two years, Joel I. Klein helped Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation weather a phone-hacking scandal at the company’s British tabloids with the promise that he would eventually be able to return to the role the company hired him for: to spearhead News Corporation’s new venture into the public school market. That day has finally come. On Wednesday at the SXSWedu conference in Austin, Tex., Mr. Klein, the former chancellor of New York City schools and the current chief executive of Amplify, News Corporation’s fledgling education division, will take the stage for a surprising announcement. Amplify will not sell just its curriculum on existing tablets, but will also offer the Amplify Tablet, its own 10-inch Android tablet for K-12 schoolchildren. In addition to tablets and curriculum, Amplify will also provide schools with infrastructure to store students’ data. “When I left I was convinced of two things,” Mr. Klein said of his tenure as chancellor of New York schools. “If we didn’t see a dramatic technological change, we were not going to be able to move this country forward,” and “second of all, that the private sector had to get much, much more involved.” An early look at the Amplify tablet revealed a sleek touch screen with material floating against a simple background. If a child’s attention wanders, a stern “eyes on teacher” prompt pops up. A quiz uses emoticons of smiley and sad faces so teachers can instantly gauge which students understand the lesson and which need help. “We wanted to use the language of the Web,” said Stephen Smyth, president of Amplify Access, the division that produces the tablet, which is manufactured by Asus. At first, the tablet will be targeted at middle-school children. It uses what educators call a “blended learning” model that mixes technology with old-fashioned teaching. Amplify designed the tablet so that schools can provide each student with one to take home each night. Outside the classroom, children can use it to play games, like one in which Tom Sawyer battles the Brontë sisters. “There’s a huge opportunity if you can get kids excited about educational games,” Mr. Klein said. “You can change the learning curve.” In November, Amplify began testing its tablet in hundreds of public schools nationwide, and in December it explained the venture to investors. The introduction on Wednesday began a full-court press by Amplify’s sales force. A preloaded tablet, training and customer care (largely from former teachers) starts at $299, along with a two-year subscription for $99 a year. A higher-end Amplify Tablet Plus, for students who do not have wireless access at home, comes with a 4G data plan and costs $349. Amplify estimates that many school districts could use grants from the Education Department’s Race to the Top program, which brings technology and personalized learning to schools. “We understand technology and we understand education,” Mr. Klein said. “A lot of people who understand technology don’t understand education.” In the eight years Mr. Klein served as chancellor of New York schools, he pushed educators to adopt new technology, often drawing accolades and controversy along the way. He remains a prominent voice in education reform, and Amplify carries with it both his friendships and clashes with educators. “Joel was always talking about how to eliminate teachers and make it about a child in front of a computer screen,” said Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers. Image Joel Klein, a former New York City schools chancellor, leads a unit of News Corporation that makes this tablet for education. Credit Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times (“Did textbooks lead to larger classrooms and fewer teachers? No,” Mr. Klein says.) Now that he is in the private sector, some of Mr. Klein’s advocacy work presents a conflict, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Last year Mr. Klein wrote, with Condoleezza Rice, a Council on Foreign Relations report that called the state of United States schools a “grave national security threat.” He contributed $25,000 to a coalition that supported specific candidates for the Los Angeles Board of Education elections held on Tuesday. (A News Corporation subsidiary also contributed to candidates.) “You can’t at the same time go out and present yourself as a civic citizen talking about how public schools right now are horrible and then say, ‘Oh, I have a product that is going to make it better,’ ” Ms. Weingarten said. (She added that she saw “real potential” in devices designed specifically for schoolchildren.) Justin Hamilton, a spokesman for Amplify, said, “Joel has long been a big supporter of education reform efforts” and “will continue to support candidates.” In the private sector, Mr. Klein, who also serves as an executive vice president of News Corporation, faces the challenge of being a part of Mr. Murdoch’s media conglomerate. The company still faces civil lawsuits related to phone hacking. Mr. Klein joined News Corporation in January 2011. In 2010, the company paid $360 million for a 90 percent stake in Wireless Generation, a Brooklyn-based company specializing in data and assessment tools for teachers. The crisis in Britain soon seeped into its new education business. In 2011, the New York State comptroller, citing “the significant ongoing investigations and continuing revelations with respect to News Corporation,” rejected a $27 million contract with Wireless Generation. “I’m very concerned about them tracking children or using their data because they’ve proven not to be very trustworthy on that,” Mr. Mulgrew said. Mr. Klein says challenges exist when any “high-visibility company” tries to work in the K-12 realm. “The company dealt with the phone-hacking thing with enormous praise from Lord Leveson,” he said, referring to an inquiry into British press ethics led by Brian Leveson. The Amplify Tablet enters a market crowded with competitors trying to tap into K-12 classrooms, which spend around $3 billion a year on traditional textbooks, according to the Association of American Publishers. Comcast’s NBCUniversal has a service called NBC Learn that uses material from NBC News. Apple has sold thousands of iPads to schools and analysts expect K-12 to become a larger piece of its business. Barnes & Noble and Amazon have both positioned their e-reader devices as options for schools. “In many ways Amplify is a start-up in this space,” said Jonathan D. Harber, chief executive of Pearson’s K-12 technology group. Pearson offers troves of digital curriculum but does not make its own tablet. This summer, when News Corporation splits into two separate publicly traded companies, Amplify will join the publishing division, which includes newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and HarperCollins, which will lend Amplify some of its content. Because of its investment in building the new business, the division will have an estimated $180 million in operational losses this year. Mr. Klein says he expects the Amplify tablets to eventually contribute 40 percent of the division’s revenue. Amplify’s curriculum, including video games as elaborate as anything played on an Xbox, is expected to contribute another 40 percent. “The ultimate goal of this is to turn students into readers,” said Damien Yambo, a producer on the Tom Sawyer game and a former public-school teacher in Detroit. The games, he added, must also compete with Angry Birds.",

    "source": "Case Built in New York Against a Jamaican Kingpin <eos> In October 2007, federal drug enforcement agents were questioning a man who had been arrested in the Bronx on gun and drug charges when he began to talk about someone he depicted as “one of the most powerful men in all of Jamaica,” records show. The man, Lloyd Reid, said he was referring to Christopher Coke , the notorious gang leader whose resistance to extradition to New York has led to violence and deaths this week in Jamaica as the authorities have hunted for him. In seeking Mr. Coke’s extradition, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, has charged that for more than a decade he has controlled an international drug ring from his neighborhood stronghold of Tivoli Gardens in Kingston. Prosecutors say Mr. Coke’s operatives in New York send him part of their drug proceeds and buy guns that they ship to him. In Jamaica, he distributes the firearms, bolstering his authority and influence, a federal indictment charges. The prosecutor’s office has not made public its extradition papers against Mr. Coke, but court records in New York show that investigators have been building a case against him through court-approved wiretaps and the questioning of people like Mr. Reid. The records offer a snapshot of how investigators believe Mr. Coke’s influence extends to the streets of New York, and suggest how the drug dealing here may have helped fortify what the indictment calls Mr. Coke’s garrison community in Jamaica, “a barricaded neighborhood guarded by a group of armed gunmen.” Prosecutors have said that Mr. Reid, who was convicted last year of conspiracy to distribute marijuana and is serving a five-year prison sentence, was an enforcer for Mr. Coke in New York. In talks with agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Mr. Reid said he had a close relationship with Mr. Coke because his brother had once served as Mr. Coke’s “right-hand man” in Jamaica before he was murdered, records show. But there was another reason, Mr. Reid told agents. He and Mr. Coke became close because they spent time together in the Bronx, where Mr. Coke once lived, according to testimony by Eric Baldus, one of the drug enforcement agents who interviewed Mr. Reid. That Mr. Coke lived in the United States is not widely known; officials say he was convicted in 1988 in North Carolina of possession of stolen property and deported the following year. Mr. Reid said he was often called upon to resolve disagreements among Mr. Coke’s operatives because people knew of his relationship with Mr. Coke, the notes show. And when problems needed resolution by a higher authority, he indicated, he relayed information to Mr. Coke. “Coke is the one who has the power to stop or settle all disputes,” Mr. Reid stated, the notes show. Mr. Reid’s lawyer, Jeremy Schneider, disputes the government’s characterization of his client. Mr. Schneider noted that Mr. Reid was convicted in a conspiracy that involved less than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana. He was also convicted of robbery conspiracy but acquitted of using a firearm in a drug trafficking crime. “He was found guilty of being a low-level marijuana dealer,” Mr. Schneider said. “He was clearly not a high-level operative representing Coke in the United States.” He added that there was “a previous familial relationship” between Mr. Coke and his client’s family. Prosecutors say that while guns and money were sent to Jamaica as part of Mr. Coke’s operation, he and his organization, called the Shower Posse, also sent something back — they provided protection for their operatives in the United States. The relationship between the operatives and “supporters in Jamaica was critical to the ability to traffic in marijuana here,” Jocelyn Strauber, a federal prosecutor, said in a pretrial proceeding in Mr. Reid’s case. Prosecutors have said in court papers that some of their evidence comes from court-authorized surveillance of what they call Mr. Coke’s co-conspirators. A transcript of one call, which was introduced at Mr. Reid’s trial last year in Federal District Court in Manhattan, shows him discussing Mr. Coke with a close associate. Mr. Reid quotes Mr. Coke as saying, “You represent me in America,” the document shows. Mr. Reid also quotes Mr. Coke as saying: “Don’t you see our thing is a worldwide thing? Nobody will mess with us.” Mr. Coke, 41, has been charged with conspiring to distribute marijuana and cocaine and to illegally traffic in firearms. If he is extradited and convicted, he could face a life sentence.",

    "source": "Novartis Ordered to Pay $250 Million in Gender Bias Suit <eos> The drug maker Novartis must pay $250 million in punitive damages for discriminating against thousands of female sales representatives over pay, promotion and pregnancy , a federal jury ruled on Wednesday. The decision was announced federal court in Manhattan by a jury of five women and four men who ruled Monday that the company’s United States division, the Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, engaged in a pattern of discrimination against women. The $250 million in punitive damages is 2.6 percent of the company’s $9.5 billion 2009 revenue. The women had sought from $190 million to $285 million. In the first part of its ruling, the jury awarded $3.3 million in compensatory damages to 12 of the women who testified. Novartis, which for the last 10 years has been declared one of the 100 best companies by Working Mother magazine, showed a pattern of discrimination against women employees from 2002 through 2007, the jury found after a five-week trial and four days of deliberation. The award to the 12 opens the door for 5,588 others who can also apply for compensatory damages. The damages will likely be determined on an individual basis by a court-appointed special master, said Katherine Kimpel, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. Judge Colleen McMahon of United States District Court will determine a lump sum for back pay, lost benefits and adjusted wages that will be distributed to plaintiffs, lawyers said. They said they were seeking $37 million to cover back pay. Novartis said after the verdict was returned on Monday that it would appeal. Carol Evans, president of Working Mother Media, said in a statement Wednesday that the lawsuit had not barred Novartis from repeatedly winning its 100 best companies award because the magazine had a different role than the court system. “We are disappointed that Novartis has engaged in discriminatory practices against women and mothers,” Ms. Evans added. “We applaud the court system for effectively finding redress for this discrimination.” She said the magazine’s award was based on programs that Novartis had in place to support working mothers, like flextime, telecommuting and paid maternity leave. “We hope that Novartis will not appeal the ruling against them and instead turn their efforts to making sure that the company has no further incidences of discrimination,” Ms. Evans said.",

    "source": "A 600-Year-Old Oak Tree Finally Succumbs <eos> BASKING RIDGE, N.J. — The locals say that George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette — the Frenchman who bankrolled the American patriots with cold, hard cash — picnicked in the shade it provided. Rank-and-file soldiers are said to have rested under it, gathering strength before going on to beat the redcoats. It is a huge oak tree, now estimated to be 600 years old. Arborists such as Rob Gillies consider it one of the oldest in North America. It is a local landmark, right there in the cemetery of the Basking Ridge Presbyterian Church . On Thursday, Mr. Gillies sliced into it with a chain saw. Not the trunk, rotund and rotted inside and long since shored up with cement, like a cavity in a bad tooth. Mr. Gillies, who is 52 and has long experience in teasing extra life out of old trees, took aim at the upper reaches. From his perch in the bucket of a cherry picker, he gave the tree a haircut, trimming away trouble spots — thick limbs that hung and could snap if tossed by winter winds or weighed down by snow. They could crash onto the street or slam into the church sanctuary, a relative youngster at only 177 years old, or an adjacent wing that is in its early 60s. Or the ancient headstones in the cemetery, the oldest of which is 280. “It’s hard to even talk about this,” Mr. Gillies said. “I really wanted to save the tree.” But a dead tree cannot be saved, and dead it is, Mr. Gillies said. It was declared unsavable last month after the latest round of soil tests and consultations with other experts. Image Rob Gillies, in the bucket of a cherry picker, pruning the 600-year-old oak tree. “It’s hard to even talk about this,” Mr. Gillies said. “I really wanted to save the tree.” Credit Bryan Anselm for The New York Times Still, it is not gone yet. The church is planning a communitywide celebration of the tree’s life on Nov. 6. And while church officials say it will come down in 2017, by coincidence the congregation’s 300th anniversary year, they have not decided what to do with the wood that will pile up. The suggestions are pouring in. The tree is a passionate subject in this little town about 40 miles from Times Square. The tree is a part of the identity of what the minister, the Rev. Dennis W. Jones, calls “a Norman Rockwell-esque town.” He himself wore a likeness of it on his sleeve when he was a police officer here, before divinity school and a career change. The church has photographs of what look like revival meetings, with the congregation seated under the tree. Mr. Jones said children climbed it after Sunday school when they were not supposed to, and couples had their wedding photos taken under it. He said he was surprised, after a television news report on the tree last month, to hear from people who had grown up here and moved away — but still cared about the tree. So did people driving by on Thursday. Many rolled down their car windows and asked if it was finally being felled. No, they were told, although some drove off without hearing the full explanation. “We want to clear the airspace above the sidewalk and the street” before winter, said Jon Klippel, the chairman of the church’s planning council. “We have some limbs that wandered a great distance.” Indeed they have. The tree is wider than it is tall — it stretches more than 150 feet from side to side, while it was only about 100 feet tall before Mr. Gillies went to work. Image Jon Klippel, left, the chairman of the church’s planning council, and the Rev. Dennis W. Jones, the church’s minister, in front of the tree. Credit Bryan Anselm for The New York Times Its very size is testimony to its age. “It’s certainly been around longer than anyone that we can tell in our recorded history (except maybe the Lenni-Lenape Indians),” the local historical society declared on its website . If the 600-year-old age estimates are correct, its youth coincided with Britain’s defeat of the French in the Battle of Agincourt and Gutenberg’s invention of movable type. And, of course, all of the voyages by explorers such as Christopher Columbus. Somehow — and this is one of the mysteries — the tree was not squeezed out before settlers arrived. Other faster-growing trees could have risen above it, blocking the sunlight before the first settlers arrived and the surrounding township was granted a royal charter in the mid-18th century. Somehow — and this is another mystery — it was left alone in cold winters if firewood ran short. By 1924, nine years after Joyce Kilmer wrote the famous poem “ Trees ,” it was 75 feet tall and still growing. It was measured, tended and loved over the decades. Then came the summer of 2016. The old oak was done in, not by an April that was the cruelest month, but by a nasty August. “On Aug. 2, we saw some dark brown leaves,” Mr. Klippel said. “Day by day, there were more. Between Aug. 2 and Aug. 14, it all went brown, and it wasn’t the usual variable range of autumnal colors coming on early.” The church called in Mr. Gillies, who climbed the tree — with permission, and not when the children from Sunday school were around. Image Keith Keiling, left, and Cesar Guillen carrying a limb from the tree as it was being pruned. The work on Oct. 13 was meant to clear thick limbs that could snap if tossed by winter winds or weighed down by snow. Credit Bryan Anselm for The New York Times The conclusion? “The tree was so old, it wasn’t able to withstand the intensity of the heat we had,” Mr. Klippel said. “We had these stretches of heat, and then a deluge.” Mr. Gillies said the tree responded to the initial “heat stress” by closing off the pores in the rings deep inside, behind the bark. “These shut down, so it doesn’t transpire,” he said. “Then it was inundated” by almost 12 hours of heavy rain. “The roots were soaking because it couldn’t process the water,” he said. Mr. Jones said that some people wanted to keep the tree propped up for longer than next spring. “But it would be a dead tree, not a symbol of a living church,” he said. Mr. Gillies said he was well aware that he was tackling a “delicate job.” Mr. Klippel said the church was grateful he felt that way. “These guys are used to the typical tree pruning, not having to disassemble the tree,” Mr. Klippel said. “They’re used to buzz, buzz, drop, drop. Some of these graves are 250, 275 years old, and so are the tombstones.” “This isn’t like in someone’s backyard,” he said, “where you can cut them off and say, ‘Look out below.’”",

    "source": "Israeli Soldier Is Killed in Attack by Palestinian <eos> JERUSALEM — The wave of deadly attacks that has roiled Israel this month hit the southern desert city of Beersheba on Sunday, where a Palestinian armed with a pistol and a knife grabbed another weapon from a soldier, fatally shot him and wounded at least nine other people, including several police officers, according to the police. In the confusion as the attack unfolded, a migrant who was apparently mistaken for a second assailant was shot and seriously wounded by an Israeli security guard, then beaten by a mob. He later died of his wounds, according to Israeli news reports. Witnesses who said they knew the man identified him as an Eritrean asylum seeker. The Palestinian assailant was killed at the scene by police officers. After more than two weeks of almost daily attacks, mostly by young Palestinians armed with knives, there had been hope in Israel that Sunday would pass peacefully. But around 7:30 p.m., reports emerged of the shooting at the central bus station in Beersheba. Based on initial reports, some Israeli commentators considered this attack more sophisticated and requiring more planning than many of the past ones this month, most of which have been carried out in Jerusalem or the West Bank by Palestinians with no known links to militant organizations. The identity of the assailant in Beersheba was not immediately known, and no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. But officials from Hamas, the Islamic militant group that dominates Gaza, praised it. Hussam Badran, a spokesman for the group, said in a statement on its official website, “We bless this unique operation that comes as a natural response to the coldblooded executions carried out by the occupation army and its settlers,” referring to Israel. “The intifada is ongoing and escalating to achieve its objectives to deter the occupier and get rid of it once and for all,” he added. The Palestinians have accused Israeli security forces of using excessive force because at least 18 suspects have been killed at the scene of the nearly 30 attacks on Israelis this month. Eight Israelis have been killed in those attacks. In clashes with Israeli security forces this month, more than 20 Palestinians have also been fatally shot. In one attack more than a week ago in the southern town of Kiryat Gat, a young Palestinian from the West Bank snatched an assault rifle from a soldier on a bus and fled into a nearby apartment block, holing up there. The police arrived and fatally shot him; he was unable to fire the weapon he stole because he had taken it without a magazine. On Saturday there were five knife attacks against Israelis, mostly members of the security forces, in the West Bank city of Hebron, in Jerusalem and at a checkpoint between Jerusalem and the West Bank city of Ramallah, according to the authorities. The Israelis escaped with minor injuries or unharmed. The assailants, including a young woman, were all fatally shot. Despite a security clampdown, Israel is struggling to prevent the attacks. The mayor of Beersheba, Ruvik Danilovich, told Army Radio on Sunday, “Fifty thousand people go through the central bus station on a daily basis, and the police have been doing their best to inspect people, but they cannot hermetically seal off this area against perpetrators.”",

    "source": "Forecast Comes True: No Playoffs for the Mets <eos> Minutes after being formally eliminated from playoff contention on Wednesday afternoon, the Mets did their best to escape the present and dwell on the past. They turned to an old reliable, the first-base coach Mookie Wilson, who unveiled a painting he and Bill Buckner commissioned of one of baseball’s most famous moments — the dribbler that Wilson hit between Buckner’s legs in the 1986 World Series, which the Mets captured against Boston in seven games. The painting will be displayed at Citi Field. That the two are cooperating in a for-profit venture 25 years after a World Series that left Wilson gleeful and Buckner in agony is intriguing in itself and — with the exception of Jose Reyes’s quest to win a batting title — as interesting as anything going on with the current Mets as they slowly cross off their remaining games. Their elimination, which had been preordained for the last month, came when Atlanta beat Florida, 4-1, on Wednesday. Just to reinforce the point, the Mets lost, 2-0, to the Washington Nationals in a listless game Wednesday night. It was their fifth straight defeat. For the Mets, it will be the fifth consecutive season without a playoff appearance, although few predicted they would make it to October when the season began. “Obviously, we’re very disappointed,” said Manager Terry Collins, who, for most of the season, has managed to keep the Mets around .500. He did so despite numerous injuries, strategic decisions to unload Francisco Rodriguez and Carlos Beltran and disappointing seasons from veterans like Jason Bay, David Wright and Mike Pelfrey, who was Wednesday’s losing pitcher. “I left spring training with a very good baseball team,” Collins said. “We couldn’t keep it together. That’s the nature of the beast.” The backdrop for this season has been an unusual one because of the financial issues consuming the team’s owners, who, among other things, are being sued for $1 billion by the trustee for the victims of Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme . On the field, though, the Mets defied expectations after a 4-11 start. They received a lift from Reyes’s remarkable season at the plate and from the surprise contributions of players like Daniel Murphy, Justin Turner, Lucas Duda and Dillon Gee. As recently as a week ago, the Mets were one victory from a .500 record again after R. A. Dickey beat the Marlins, 1-0. Since then, the Mets have lost seven of eight, and Collins has appeared increasingly frustrated, sensing that his players have started to wilt. For one thing, the Mets have not been putting together as many quality plate appearances, seeming to give away at-bats by swinging early in the count. On Wednesday, the Mets managed only two hits off the Nationals’ 23-year-old pitching prospect Brad Peacock, who threw five scoreless innings to earn his first big league win. “It’s definitely easier to get up for games when you know you’re playing for something,” Gee acknowledged. “Right now, it’s harder to bear down and have the effort to be there. Mentally, I think it’s a mental barrier. You think you’re done.” Nevertheless, several Mets, after learning they were eliminated, said they hoped to make a push to get the team back to .500 or better. The players also said they would try to relish the role of spoiler in their coming series against the Braves and the St. Louis Cardinals, who are still fighting over the wild card. “There’s going to be some silver linings,” Collins said. “I’m very, very proud of the way these guys played. They could have folded this up two months ago. “It was just one after another,” he added about all the injuries and trades that subtracted important players for weeks, or months, or for good. With a .331 average after going 1 for 5 in Wednesday’s game, Reyes had a small lead over Milwaukee’s Ryan Braun (.329) in the batting race. If Reyes can hold on, he will become the first Met to be the N.L.’s batting champion. That, in turn, would only enhance his value as he proceeds into free agency, with the Mets’ chances to re-sign him not at all clear. But the Mets have the coming months to wrestle with that issue. For now, they have two weeks left in a season that has lost its verve. That has left them looking to the past, as a star from yesteryear did on Wednesday, in search of the happier moments as another long off-season looms.",

    "source": "Bernie Sanders, in New York, Presses Fight Against ‘Status Quo’ <eos> Locked in a fierce fight with Hillary Clinton to win the New York primary, Senator Bernie Sanders took his plea for a political revolution to the heart of Greenwich Village on Wednesday and heaped particular scorn on Wall Street to the delight of several thousand jubilant supporters. Speaking on a cloudless night in Washington Square Park, the famed arch dramatically lit behind him, Mr. Sanders said he drew inspiration from the trade unions, gay rights activists and others fighting to “change the status quo.” He repeatedly denounced “corporate greed and the rigged economy,” taking aim at the big banks just to the south, and said that defending the interests of regular Americans was the abiding cause of his presidential campaign. “It is about creating a government that works for all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributors,” Mr. Sanders said, one of several negative comments or insinuations that he lobbed in Mrs. Clinton’s direction. “This campaign is sending a message to corporate America: You cannot have it all.” Image In buildings along the park, New York University students and workers pressed against windows to watch Senator Bernie Sanders and the vast crowd below on the chilly night. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times With Sanders admirers waving placards reading “Democracy v Oligarchy, Humanity v Greed” and ‘‘Not Me — Us,” the rally had the feel of some of the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011 and 2012, with the predominantly young crowd cheering Mr. Sanders every time he railed against major companies and executives and promised to impose higher taxes on Wall Street. People waited for hours in lines that stretched several blocks to get into the park, and they seemed spellbound at times as Mr. Sanders held forth against the wealthy and the powerful — in particular, Mrs. Clinton. “You can tell a lot about a candidate and the campaigns run by how they raise the money they need to run those campaigns,” Mr. Sanders said, drawing a contrast between his historic success with low-dollar online donations and Mrs. Clinton’s dependence on four-figure donations and “super PACs.” And when he mentioned the $675,000 in speaking fees she received from Goldman Sachs, the crowd roared with boos. Sanders campaign aides said that about 27,000 people attended the rally, a striking number; Barack Obama also filled the park during a rally in 2007, but his campaign said only about 20,000 people had registered. But no matter the exact count, the rally was an event that went viral on social media and drew people who flew to New York specifically for the event. In buildings along the park, New York University students and workers pressed against windows to watch the senator and the vast crowd below on the chilly night. “Bernie is promising the change we need when we need it,” said Terence Gardner, 25, a freelance film editor who lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Mr. Gardner cited climate change as the policy issue that worried him the most, and said he had great faith that Mr. Sanders would make environmental protection a top priority. Image Sanders campaign aides said that about 27,000 people attended Wednesday night’s rally in Washington Square Park. Credit Benjamin Norman for The New York Times “Climate change affects everything in my life, from where I’m going to live to whether I wanted to have kids,” said Mr. Gardner, who added that he did not know many details about Mrs. Clinton’s policy agenda. Before Mr. Sanders took the stage, several celebrity supporters addressed one of his biggest challenges in New York: He has been a far more popular vote-getter than Mrs. Clinton with independents, yet only registered Democrats are allowed to cast ballots in the primary. They urged the crowd to do everything they could to persuade more Democrats to support Mr. Sanders and help turn out the vote on Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton, who will debate the senator on Thursday, has held a comfortable lead over him in recent opinion polls. But Sanders supporters at the rally said they thought the intensity of support for the senator could lead to an upset victory on Tuesday, similar to his win in Michigan last month. “Change will not happen by choosing a candidate who is entirely entrenched in the dysfunction of the past,” said the actor Tim Robbins, who recalled protesting in the park against the Vietnam War as a young man. Mr. Sanders told the crowd that “it’s going to be a tough primary for us” because independents could not vote and young people, among others, could not register at polling places on Tuesday. But he said he was still hopeful. Image The rally had the feel of some of the Occupy Wall Street protests, with the predominantly young crowd cheering Mr. Sanders every time he railed against major companies. Credit Christian Hansen for The New York Times “If we have a large voter turnout on Tuesday, we’re going to win this thing,” Mr. Sanders said. The large crowd, and the senator’s promises to change politics, had much in common with the 2007 rally for Mr. Obama in the park. Like Mr. Sanders, Mr. Obama was running an aggressive campaign against Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Obama’s visit to Washington Square Park was seen as a shot across her bow. Mr. Obama criticized Mrs. Clinton over Social Security reform, but mostly needled her, such as noting that she had refused to commit to root for the New York Yankees over the Chicago Cubs if the teams ever faced off in the World Series. At Wednesday’s rally, Mr. Sanders was more aggressive against Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Obama had been, assailing her for supporting some free trade agreements in the past and voting to authorize the war in Iraq. He portrayed her judgment as faulty and her pledges to change America as unreliable, based on her ties with bank and corporate executives and major donors. “What this campaign is profoundly about is that real change never occurs from the top on down — it’s from the bottom up,” Mr. Sanders said. Some people said they came out because they were still making up their mind between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton. Lauri Owens, an undecided voter from Forest Hills, Queens, said she shared Mr. Sanders’s concern that corporations had far too much influence, but was not sure if Mr. Sanders would be able to change anything as president. “I’d like to see someone who thinks about us again,” she said. “Regular people.”",

    "source": "Quiet Bats and a Flub Send the Mets to Another Loss <eos> A week and a half ago, the Mets were the hottest team in baseball, having won 11 straight games. Citi Field was shedding its longstanding reputation for being desolate for much of April, attracting boisterous fans who, having been roused from their hibernation, were championing the ballpark as the home of the best pitching staff in the major leagues. But after a four-game series with the Nationals in which the Mets lost three times, including a second consecutive 1-0 loss at home on Sunday, the road to the National League East pennant still appears likely to go through Washington. Although the defeat did not knock the Mets out of first place — they are three and a half games ahead of Atlanta and Miami and four ahead of Washington — they have lost five of their last six games. They have also dropped 17 of their last 19 home games against the Nationals, dating to 2013. “Anytime you don’t win in your division, it’s missed opportunities,” left fielder Michael Cuddyer said. “But at the same time, it’s not like those guys are cakewalks over there. That’s a good team, good pitching.” The Mets’ pitchers remain their best asset, and Sunday’s starter, Dillon Gee, gave the team a chance to win even as his accuracy was off. The Mets’ offense, however, was unable to solve Nationals starter Doug Fister, who allowed five hits in his six and a third innings, and the Mets finished the game 0 for 7 with runners in scoring position, with Lucas Duda and Cuddyer striking out swinging to strand runners on second and third in the eighth inning. Gee fell to 0-2, walking five and allowing six hits. He left the game after loading the bases with no outs in the sixth, but Alex Torres struck out the next three batters to keep the score at 1-0. “I feel like almost from the first inning today, it was kind of like, this is going to be a battle,” Gee said, adding that he did not feel as good as he had during his last start, when he allowed one run in seven and two-thirds innings against the Marlins. The Mets’ recent struggles to drive in runs have been compounded by the continuation of a problem that arose in spring training: substandard middle- infield defense, particularly at shortstop. Ruben Tejada was given a second straight start at shortstop on Sunday to allow the usual starter, Wilmer Flores, to “get his mind straight,” Mets Manager Terry Collins said before the game. Tejada, while less of a threat offensively than Flores, is considered more sure-handed in the field. But a costly early miscue had Gee working from behind all afternoon. Image Mets starter Dillon Gee after he was removed with the bases loaded in the sixth inning of Sunday's game against the Nationals. Credit Kathy Willens/Associated Press After Denard Span led off the game with a walk, Yunel Escobar hit a grounder to Mets second baseman Dilson Herrera, who made a clean throw to Tejada for the forceout. Tejada, though, did not cleanly transfer the ball from his glove, and his delayed throw to first base could not complete the double play. Escobar later scored on a broken-bat single by Ryan Zimmerman. Tejada said after the game that the ball stuck in his hand momentarily and he could not find a grip. Sunday’s lineup change will not be permanent, Collins indicated. But with Flores having committed seven errors in his first 21 games of the season, including one in each of his last three starts, Collins felt Flores would benefit from some time off. (The Mets do not play Monday.) “I’m not just really thinking about anything,” Flores said. “I was just watching the game and trying to clear my mind.” Cuddyer, who made a leaping grab at the left-field wall to rob Zimmerman of a home run in the fourth, said the day off would be beneficial for the entire team. “Everybody can get recharged, refreshed,” Cuddyer said, adding that players would also have a good opportunity to realize the Mets were “still on top of the division right now.” “There’s no reason to press,” he said. Lately, though, in an effort to jump-start their offense, the Mets have been swinging at balls out of the strike zone, including pitches in the dirt with two strikes in the count. This series against Washington included little evidence that the team could consistently score on the Nationals’ pitchers, who outpitched their Mets counterparts. The Mets tallied two runs on Thursday against Stephen Strasburg but could not score again. On Friday, they were clinging to a 1-0 lead in the late innings; Nationals left fielder Jayson Werth then misplayed a fly ball in the eighth that led to three runs and an eventual 4-0 Mets victory . “This isn’t just one or two guys,” Collins said. “We’ve got to put some better swings on the ball throughout the lineup.” The Mets opened the season by taking two of three at Washington, which was missing three important position players: Werth, Danny Espinosa and Span. The Nationals’ pitchers still gave up only four earned runs in that series (10 total runs). The Mets are trying not to let their recent disappointments linger even though the path to a division crown may not be as easy as it appeared a couple of weeks ago. “You’re not going to beat them every single time you play them,” Cuddyer said. “That’s the nature of the business. The other side of it is, we only lost, 1-0, the last two days. So we were right there in the game. One big hit here, one big hit there, we win those games.”",

    "source": "After Making History, Jeter Makes the Yankees Winners <eos> With one out in the third inning Saturday, space was at a premium on the rail of the Yankees ’ dugout. Players and staff members crowded shoulder to shoulder, jostling for what they hoped would be the best view of history. Manager Joe Girardi was at one end, arms draped over the railing in his familiar pose; second baseman Robinson Cano was at the other end, a towel across his shoulder and one leg raised on the steps. Jorge Posada was smack in the middle. Posada is Derek Jeter ’s best friend on the Yankees, a teammate since 1992, when they were playing Class A ball in Greensboro, N.C. Posada, the longtime Yankees catcher and current designated hitter, had seen so many of Jeter’s 2,999 major league hits over the years that he was not going to miss this one. When Jeter swung, his shiny black bat meeting a full-count breaking ball from Tampa Bay Rays starter David Price, Posada shot his arms up. He knew, even before the ball had landed in the left-field bleachers, what had happened: Jeter had reached the coveted 3,000-hit mark, the first Yankee to do so, in the most thrilling of fashions. The Yankees poured onto the field, jumping joyously at home plate as Jeter rounded the bases. With his second hit of the day, in his second at-bat, Jeter — No. 2 — reached the milestone at 2 p.m. Posada pushed to the front of the mass of players, his smile wide as he wrapped Jeter in a fierce embrace. Mariano Rivera, the third remaining Yankee from the dynasty teams of the 1990s, was right behind Posada, and a receiving line of teammates was at the heart of an on-field celebration that lasted about four minutes. Even the relievers ran in from the bullpen. “I told him I was proud of him,” Posada said. “It was relief,” Jeter said of his emotions. “I was excited but, to be honest with you, I was just pretty relieved.” The ovation from the Yankee Stadium crowd of 48,103 lingered, long and loud. Price walked off the mound to get a drink of water, and he waited by the Rays ’ dugout, where several players — led by the former Yankee Johnny Damon — stood and cheered for Jeter, too. Jeter turned to each corner of the stadium as he accepted the congratulations, also acknowledging Price and the Rays. He then raised a fist toward the luxury suite where his family and friends, including his father and his girlfriend, the actress Minka Kelly , were seated. Kelly appeared to be blinking back tears. When the cheers continued even longer, Jeter returned to the field for a curtain call but admitted he felt sheepish, wanting the game to continue. Finally, after Price had thrown a few warm-up pitches, it did. But Jeter was not done. He doubled in the fifth inning, singled in the sixth and drove in the go-ahead run with another single in the eighth, matching a career high by going 5 for 5 as the Yankees beat the Rays, 5-4 . “It would have been really, really awkward to be out there doing interviews and waving to the crowd if we would have lost,” Jeter said. “If we didn’t win, it definitely would have put a damper on things.” On a different day, Jeter — ever the team player — might have tried to point to that single in the eighth as the biggest hit, but on this day even he conceded that completing his quest loomed larger. He reached 2,994 hits on June 13, then was sidelined for three weeks with a calf injury. He returned July 4, got three hits during a series in Cleveland, and then climbed to within two of the mark with a double on Thursday against the Rays. When Friday’s game was rained out — decreasing his chance to get the 3,000th hit at home because the Yankees have a series in Toronto right after the All-Star break — Jeter was frustrated. “I’ve been lying to you guys for a long time, saying I wasn’t nervous and there’s no pressure,” he said to reporters. “There was a lot of pressure to do it here.” After his first at-bat, though, he was able to relax a bit. Jeter was patient early in the count in that first at-bat, but on a 3-2 pitch, Price “could have thrown it in the dugout and I was going to swing,” Jeter said. Fortunately for the Yankees, Price threw a fastball that Jeter smacked to left field for hit No. 2,999. The crowd roared and Price, a left-hander, hung his head. Two innings later, he tried a different tack against Jeter, throwing a curveball on 3-2. Jeter, memorably, hit that one, too. “I’d rather not be the answer to that particular trivia question,” Price said of his place in history. “But I am.” The celebration continued throughout the game, as the Yankees played video tributes to Jeter between innings. Jeter then provided an almost perfect coda to the day with his eighth-inning single, although Rivera, who saved the game in the ninth, joked that he thought Jeter was going to hit a triple, which would have given him the cycle. Still, “it was a storybook ending,” said the rapper Jay-Z, who was among the crowd in the tunnel outside the Yankees’ clubhouse after the game. “He’s just a winner,” Jay-Z said. “That’s how it happens.” Also in the throng was Joe Torre, the former Yankees manager who is an executive for Major League Baseball. Torre sat in the stands for the game, then met with Jeter afterward and put him on the phone with Commissioner Bud Selig, who wanted to offer congratulations. “Derek is just amazing,” Torre said. Perhaps no one has seen that as often as Posada and Rivera. The old friends met reporters wearing T-shirts commemorating Jeter’s milestone, and the pride they took in his accomplishment was evident. “He deserves it,” Rivera said. “And I hope he has another thousand or two more.”",

    "source": "Two Accounts on Jet Crash Seem to Vary <eos> WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 - Fifteen minutes before a charter jet crashed on takeoff in Colorado, killing three people including a son of the NBC Sports executive Dick Ebersol, the two pilots discussed the plane's wings and decided there was no ice on them, according to a transcript of the cockpit voice recording. But Mr. Ebersol, who along with another son survived the crash, told investigators in an interview two months afterward that \"chunks of slush\" slid from the roof and windows of the plane before takeoff, according to other documents, which, like the transcript, were among some 150 pages of reports on the accident released Thursday by the National Transportation Safety Board. The safety board has not yet established a probable cause of the accident, which occurred in Montrose, Colo., on Nov. 28, 2004, when the plane, a twin-engine Canadair Challenger, skidded off the runway, broke apart and caught fire. But a month after the interview with Mr. Ebersol, the board issued an alert warning pilots that particles of frost or ice \"the size of a grain of table salt and distributed as sparsely as one per square centimeter\" could reduce a wing's lift enough to prevent takeoff. The plane, bound from California to South Bend, Ind., had landed in Montrose, Colo., to drop off Mr. Ebersol's wife, the actress Susan Saint James, and another passenger. It was on the ground in light snow for about 45 minutes, Mr. Ebersol estimated, and was not de-iced. Mr. Ebersol's son Teddy was killed in the ensuing accident, as were the captain, Alberto Polanco, 50, and the flight attendant, Warren Richardson III, 36. According to the voice recorder transcript, before takeoff the captain asked, \"How do you see the wings?\" Seven seconds later, the first officer answered, \"Good,\" and the captain said, \"Looks clear to me.\"",

    "source": "In a Contract Season, Jacobs Remains Confident <eos> EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — When the Giants had finished stampeding through the vaunted Baltimore Ravens defense last month, Brandon Jacobs strutted toward the locker room and shouted a message to no one in particular. “Big money out there,” he said. “Free agency.” When contract negotiations broke down during training camp, Jacobs set out to become an attractive find for a team seeking a top running back, and that meant banishing the impression that he was not a durable player who could withstand punishment an entire season. “Well, my main goal this year is to play 16 games,” Jacobs said in Albany last July. “If I play 16 games, everything is going to fall right into place for me.” Jacobs is the leading rusher on the N.F.L.’s best rushing team, pounding his way to 1,002 yards and 12 touchdowns. But he sat out his second straight practice Thursday with a sore left knee and his status for Sunday night’s clash with the Cowboys is in doubt. If Jacobs does not play, Derrick Ward and Ahmad Bradshaw, who returned to full practice Thursday after a neck injury, will carry the load. Jacobs was first injured against Seattle on Oct. 5, was dinged against the Ravens and sat out the next week against the Cardinals. In the past two games he rushed for 123 yards on 31 carries. “Everything comes down to the doctors,” Jacobs said Wednesday. “But like I said, just the competitive nature in me, I want to be out there to play.” Jacobs, 26, is in the final year of his rookie contract and earning $927,000. He repeated last summer that that figure has never weighed on his mind, suggesting that his performance on the field would do all the advertising he needed. But he had rushed for over 1,000 yards last season, as well, and that failed to prod the Giants enough to offer him a new deal. Teams looking at Jacobs this spring will have to decide whether his durability is still a concern and if they can handle the showman inside him. Last Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles, Jacobs broke off a 23-yard run that did not result in a touchdown but still warranted, in his opinion, a little look-at-me skip. It was innocuous enough then, but when he tried a highlight-reel hurdle against the Eagles in their previous meeting, two defenders sandwiched him and caused a fumble. Giants General Manager Jerry Reese declined to comment on Jacobs’s impending unrestricted free agency in an e-mail message Thursday because the Giants never publicly discuss contract negotiations. “I’m fine with playing with what I’m making this year,” Jacobs said in July. “I don’t have a problem at all with playing with my salary and hitting the market.” EXTRA POINTS Wide receiver Domenik Hixon (ankle/foot) missed a second consecutive day of practice. ... Defensive end Justin Tuck (lower leg) participated for only part of the session. Neither has yet been ruled out of playing on Sunday.",

    "source": "China Sets Tough Line in Climate Talks <eos> BEIJING — Senior Chinese officials said on Tuesday that next week’s climate talks in Cancún, Mexico, would succeed only if the West agreed to transfer technology to developing countries like China and to take the lead in cutting emissions. The comments by one of China’s senior officials in charge of climate issues, Xie Zhenhua of the powerful National Development and Reform Commission, were mirrored by two other senior Chinese climate officials who earlier this week published a report saying China was willing to make concessions — if developed nations put money into a $30 billion fund aimed at helping poor nations cope with global warming . Western countries pledged to set up such a fund but details have yet to be worked out. Mr. Xie said it would be the key to securing a deal to the 1997 Kyoto treaty, which is due to expire in 2012. The positions reflect a long-standing view by developing countries, led by China, that they are largely not responsible for climate change — which they say was caused by decades of western pollution — and thus should not play a leading role in reversing it. Stated forcefully by China’s chief climate officials, the comments reemphasized the challenge facing negotiators in Cancun as they try to reconcile the positions of the two camps. “Developed countries need to take the lead in massively cutting their green house gas emission in order to give further development space to developing countries,” Mr. Xie said. “Developing countries in particular should be concerned about achieving tangible results with regard to funding and technology transfer issues.” The United States, by contrast, wants developing countries to curb emissions and agree to international verification. Mr. Xie called on developed countries to cut emissions by up to 40 percent and emphasized that China has already made huge strides in cutting pollution, even though its 30-year program of economic reforms have vaulted it to the forefront of industrialized nations. “No single country or single block of countries has achieved that in history,” Mr. Xie said. “This is our big contribution to the international community.” Despite China’s growth, Mr. Xie said it remains a developing country and couldn’t be treated like the United States or European countries with respect to climate change. “We will never accept anything beyond our condition as a developing country,” he said. Mr. Xie noted that China had made pollution cuts such a priority that some local governments had made last-ditch efforts to meet pollution-reduction targets. This year some factories closed as officials tried to meet targets for reducing China’s “energy intensity” — the amount of power consumer per unit of economic output.",

    "source": "Men at Kansas City Release Center Worry as Prison Plans to Move In <eos> KANSAS CITY, Mo. — When the Missouri Department of Corrections announced in February that it planned to open a minimum-security prison near this city’s downtown, the response from civic leaders was one that might seem surprising: joy. But it is actually what the prison is replacing that has them pleased. For more than three-and-a-half decades, the West Bottoms, an old warehouse neighborhood on the edge of downtown, has been home to a center that holds hundreds of men on probation or parole who have been released from prison but do not have a suitable place to live. The men are generally free to leave during the day to work, find a job or get treatment. Yet some residents and business leaders have complained that many of the men simply roam the streets, cluster on corners and cause trouble. A prison would ease that problem, they say, because the men housed there would be inmates who would not be released into the neighborhood during the day. “The image of having a prison in the neighborhood is not good, and sometimes the people who go to visit the prisoners are not the best element in the neighborhood,” said Bill Haw Sr., a developer and businessman in the West Bottoms . “It’s not utopia yet. But it’s an amazingly positive development compared to the work-release environment.” Still, a looming question is what will happen to the 135 men now housed in the site, the Kansas City Community Release Center, which corrections officials hope to have converted to a prison by September. The move has left many of the men trying to figure out where they will live when the center closes. Several said that they had been told that if they did not come up with acceptable living arrangements on their own, they might be placed in a homeless shelter. “If they’re going to send these guys to shelters, if that’s the idea, that’s that much worse,” said R. Crosby Kemper III, the director of the Kansas City Public Library, which has become a gathering place for men from the center and other transient people in the area. “The shelters are not monitoring them during the day, which the community release center was supposed to be doing. The shelter’s not making them sign in and out.” But David Owen, a spokesman for the Corrections Department, wrote in an email that no residents would be sent to homeless shelters. Image The Kansas City Community Release Center in the West Bottoms, an old warehouse neighborhood on the edge of downtown. Credit Nick Schnelle for The New York Times “The department has been working with community partners that have possible alternative housing for offenders who cannot get approved home plans,” Mr. Owen wrote. “Some offenders may be placed in a contracted residential facility” or at other corrections facilities, he added. Corrections officials said they were converting the release center, which has a capacity of 410, to a prison because of the state’s increasing inmate population — up 1.5 percent since 2005 and currently 205 inmates over its limit. The site was originally intended to be a low-level prison, officials said, but was converted to a release center when inmate numbers were not as high. The release center in Kansas City is one of two in the state. The other is in St. Louis. In general, the centers take in people on parole or probation who do not have a feasible housing option. Typically, the Kansas City center takes former prisoners from the west side of the state, and St. Louis takes those from the east side. Business leaders in St. Louis have expressed concern that their city’s center, with a capacity of 550, would have to take on more people because of the closing in Kansas City. A spokeswoman for Francis G. Slay, the mayor of St. Louis, said the corrections commissioner had told city officials that the St. Louis release center, which houses 397 men, would not have to shoulder a greater share of the state’s parolees and probationers. In Kansas City, several residents of the center said they were pleased to be moving on because staff members were rude and disrespectful. They also described the support services as lax. One time after he returned from his construction job at 10:30 p.m., Jamie Killian said, a staff member put him on overnight cleanup duty even though he had to go to work the next morning. Mr. Killian, who has been here since April off a 10-year sentence on multiple drug charges, said he expected to leave soon because his plan to live in an apartment in suburban Kansas City had been approved. “We’re in a good mood all day long until we start walking down that bridge,” he said, pointing toward a bend that leads to the release center. The corrections officers, he added, “talk to you like you’re a piece of. …” He finished the sentence with an expletive, but then thought better of it, saying, “like we’re dirt.” The prospect of getting sent to a homeless shelter actually seemed more appealing than remaining in the center, some said. “There’s no guaranteeing that you’re getting out each day,” Jeffrey Cox, 47, said of the center where he has been housed for about two months after spending four years in prison for drunken driving. Image Tyre Winfrey, 23, waiting for the bus to attend orientation at his new job. Mr. Winfrey has been in the release center for about two months, and said that he was unsure of where he would go when the center is replaced by the prison. Credit Nick Schnelle for The New York Times “Even at the shelter, I’m not going to wake up worrying about whether they’re going to let me out the door,” he said. “Inside this place here, if they feel you’ve done something wrong, if you’ve had a disciplinary or you’ve not completed one of their programs or something, they lock you in solitary or in the hole. It’s a prison outside of prison is what it is.” Corrections officials did not respond to a request for comment about the treatment. On a recent cloudy morning shortly after 9, Mr. Cox, lanky with a bony, red face, trudged out of the center to start what has been his daily ritual over the last month. Toting a plastic shopping bag with several essentials including his wallet and an umbrella, he was headed to the downtown library to check the weather on the Internet. He would then search for job openings, he said, and figure out which buses he needed to take to get to the sites. Mr. Kemper, the library director, said he understood concerns that the congregation of people from the center in and around the library might disturb other patrons. But, he added, the library had a “genuine civic obligation” to help them. The library has adult literacy programs, high school equivalency diploma classes and computer training that residents of the center participate in, he said. “We’re there to serve everybody,” he said. “Some people are more difficult to serve than others and, obviously, the community release center people, coming out of prison, are going to be among the toughest patrons that we’ve got. In some ways that makes them even more important.” The release center, with a tan facade and royal-blue roof, sits tucked beneath a highway in a sunken old warehouse district near the intersection of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers. It is about a 10-minute walk from the downtown. As a prison, it will house inmates nearing release. “It gives us a great opportunity to start working with the people on their transition into the community before they are released,” said Kathy Ficcadenti, the program manager for Catholic Charities of Kansas City-St. Joseph. The organization has been working with corrections officials to get the remaining residents of the release center into housing that could include community-based halfway houses, Ms. Ficcadenti said. Those could provide a better alternative to the release center, she said, because the men would be spread out throughout the community, making it easier for them to find jobs. Tyre Winfrey, who is from California and has been in the release center for about two months, said that he had no ties in Missouri and that officials had declined his petition to live back in his home state. “They tell us to get a job and ask some of these ministries to help us get places to live,” said Mr. Winfrey, who served nearly two years for burglary and theft. “I’m concerned about it. Where do I get to go?”",

    "source": "A Passion Play Endures in Florida <eos> WAUCHULA, Fla. — With less than two hours until showtime, a man sits amid the backstage chaos and studies his image in a propped-up mirror. The eyes are grayish blue, the goatee trim, the long dark hair flecked with gray. Not there yet. He scoops another dab of makeup to continue the annual transformation of Mike Graham, now 58, into Jesus Christ, forever 33. An assistant hustles over with a sky-blue robe that an anxious Mr. Graham wriggles over his bare torso and summer shorts. “Too little on me,” he says apologetically, working his way out of it. Someone else asks him to assess a young girl’s angel costume. “I’d like her to be glittered,” he says, before asking whether the child has been warned how to behave around the camels. Then the man who plays Jesus for a living turns back to his imperfect reflection. For more than two decades, Mr. Graham, a preacher, has directed and assumed the lead role in a gritty Passion play, “The Story of Jesus,” that unfolds 10 nights a year in the modest Cattleman’s Arena, in rural Hardee County. Across its dirt-floor stage come chariots and sword fights, miracles and betrayals, exotic animals and a cast of hundreds. Over time, Mr. Graham’s play has survived many trials, some natural, some economic and some, he suspects, the work of the devil. In 2004, the production weathered both the competition of the Mel Gibson movie “ The Passion of the Christ ” and the wrath of a hurricane that nearly swept Wauchula away but spared the play’s many costumes and long-suffering donkey. Other challenges, he says, have included his divorce years ago, which alienated many followers; a decline in attendance, due in part to competition from the Holy Land Experience theme park in Orlando ; and other, curiously timed setbacks — a car accident, a sudden illness — that nearly prevented him from picking up his cross. Finally, Mr. Graham knows the folly of trying to slow time, although he has tried. For one thing, he has enlisted a 27-year-old bridge inspector to play Jesus in certain taxing scenes. “He handles the Trial, the Ascension, the Resurrection,” Mr. Graham explains. “I do all the miracles, basically. The adult life of Jesus, the Last Supper, the garden of Gethsemane scene, and the Crucifixion.” Mr. Graham cuts his hair just once a year, and works out every morning in his home gym so that he is able to carry a heavy cross dozens of yards across the stage. Still, he has no desire to follow the great Josef Meier , who played Jesus in performances in South Dakota and in Lake Wales, just north of here, well into his 80s. A miracle in itself. For now, Mr. Graham must set aside these concerns, and focus. The first Passion play of the season is just 90 minutes away. Props, Paint and Petting Zoo Under the late-afternoon sun, white cast members take turns getting spray-painted a color called Sebring brown, a shade that Mr. Graham thinks approaches a Middle Eastern skin tone. A man in a “Sprayin’ & Prayin’ ” T-shirt dilutes the chocolate muck in plastic buckets, while another man, with a praying-hands tattoo on his left leg, paints a succession of outstretched arms, splayed legs and wincing faces. This ritual is one of many that have evolved over the last quarter-century, ever since Mr. Graham, as a guitar-wielding youth pastor from southern Illinois , staged a crucifixion scene at a church banquet with a few teenagers and a couple of props. Some of those here tonight have never been in a Passion play; others have never known a spring without one. They are united now by glistening coats of Sebring brown. Alongside the arena, clusters of ticketholders gather for some nonalcoholic tailgating, while a Roman centurion trots past on a horse. In a tent nearby, volunteers set out various souvenirs for sale, including cardboard license plates that say: The Story of Jesus — I Was There! — Wauchula, Florida . A kind of off-limits petting zoo has sprung up beyond the arena’s back entrance, with pens containing ducks, sheep, horses, two oxen, a donkey and three camels, just arrived from Ocala. Their owner, Butch Rivers, 70, a former stunt rider who now uses a cane — “You pay for it,” he says of certain passions — is excited to see the play again. “The first time I saw this play it put chills on me,” Mr. Rivers says. An hour until showtime, and the Cattleman’s Arena awaits its first-century bustle. The dirt has been raked and sprayed with water, to keep the dust down. All soda cans and other remnants of the future have been removed. The still-life setting is as serene as the blue-dyed river dug into the dirt, stage right. But just a few yards away, in an exhibit hall serving as backstage, a large industrial fan stirs the nervous air. Actors hunt through a long rack of costumes that runs beneath a portrait gallery of beauty queens, the “Cattlemen’s Sweethearts” of the near and distant past. Children wolf down treats and Gatorade before assuming the roles of angels and demons. Girding thespians reach for their fake spears and swords. Behind the Scenes Here is Joann Grantham, 56, volunteer prop master, who has done everything from scour discount stores for plastic fruit to retouch the throne of the child king. She has also helped to decide whether you’re a shop owner, an apostle or a member of the Sanhedrin. (Mr. Graham, by the way, is aware of the history of anti-Semitic Passion plays, and takes pains not to traffic in stereotypes.) In the past, Ms. Grantham has often played a “false witness” who spits on Jesus. But she chose to remain behind the scenes this year, after undergoing chemotherapy and radiation for breast cancer . When she goes to Wal-Mart , she says, she wears a hat to cover her bald head, but tonight she feels at home, hatless and happy. Here, too, is Michelle Puma , 54, volunteer makeup artist, who has set up shop in the 4-H Club’s concession booth. Everything is in its place: the long-haired wigs set on Styrofoam heads; the various jars of fake blood; the blue boxes of Jesus beards; the Ace Hardware bucket containing various props, including a crown of thorns. One of Ms. Puma’s challenges is to make young people look older, which is the opposite of Mr. Graham’s task, as he peers critically into a mirror leaning against a menu board. “My hair’s just crazy tonight,” he says. Mr. Graham’s words seem rooted more in worry than vanity. Because he deeply believes that this play is how God wants him to spread the Word, his mind races with all the things that could distract from that message, and have: camels arriving a week late, a teenager texting on stage, a stray chicken flying out of Lazarus’s tomb. How about the time a couple of camera-carrying tourists wandered into the John the Baptist crowd scene? He is also thinking of a shortfall. The production costs about $250,000 a year, which includes the modest salaries for Mr. Graham and his wife, Diane, who will play Mary Magdalene tonight, and various rentals, from the arena to the camels ($1,000 a night). And, of course, here he is again, trying to be 33. But Mr. Graham has a plan: to replace “The Story of Jesus,” at least next year, with a new production, “The Story of Noah,” featuring himself in the lead role of the biblical patriarch, who was said to have lived several hundred years. Maybe someday, if he raises enough money, he will be able to build an outdoor theater of his own. Fifteen minutes to showtime. Mr. Graham, now in full Jesus attire, climbs on top of a table, near a sign promoting beef (“Real Food for Real People”), and uses a microphone to deliver some last-minute reminders. No cellphones. No gum. No glasses. No watches. And if you’re a teenage girl who is wondering, “Can I hang out with the Sanhedrin?” — the answer is no! Mr. Graham leads everyone in a short prayer and a rallying hymn, then releases his energized flock with: “Let’s go! Do it!” A Happy Ending Showtime, and on a dirt stage in a darkened arena, the Story unfolds again. An innkeeper, played by a Sebring-brown student of Harley-Davidson mechanics, leads a couple to shelter. The baby Jesus, played by an infant named Angelina, is raised triumphantly into the air, while four white-robed angels, teenage girls strapped into harnesses, glide by pulley across the ceiling. Hear the wails of mothers whose baby boys have been slaughtered by Herod’s soldiers. See the colorful scrum of early commerce. Breathe the dust kicked up by the scurry of sheep and the plodding of oxen. Marvel as Jesus raises a child from the dead, halts the stoning of an adulteress and, thanks to a concealed harness and a fog machine, walks on water. During the brief intermission, take in the orange-blossom air of the Florida night. Buy a “Story of Jesus” fan for $2. Enjoy some nachos, or a bowl of mini doughnuts slathered with whipped cream. Return, then, to brace for the bloody, violent passion. The scourging, the spitting, the echo of nails hammered into hands and feet. The death. But everyone in the aluminum bleachers knows: This is not how the play ends. Soon the resurrected Jesus returns to the stage in glory. His crown of gold glittering, his sword raised high, he races back and forth on a galloping steed, perfect in its whiteness. The applause and cheers of 1,400 ring through a rodeo arena in central Florida. When it is over, Mr. Graham, exhausted, 58, ready to do it again tomorrow, takes the microphone to thank the audience and ask for parting donations. And if anyone wants to be baptized, there are robes, towels and a manmade river dyed a deep blue.",

    "source": "J.F. terHorst, Ford Press Secretary, Dies at 87 <eos> J. F. terHorst, a reporter who in August 1974 was appointed White House press secretary by an old friend, President Gerald R. Ford , but who resigned less than a month later when Ford granted former President Richard M. Nixon an unconditional pardon in connection with the Watergate scandal, died Wednesday in Asheville, N.C. He was 87. The cause was congestive heart failure, said his son, Peter. Mr. terHorst’s resignation was — and still is — considered a rare act of conscience by a high-ranking public official, and the circumstances in which it occurred were extraordinary. He was a veteran newsman, the Washington bureau chief of The Detroit News and a respected member of the White House press corps when he was named press secretary by Ford. He had known Ford since he covered his first Congressional race in 1948 for The Grand Rapids Press, and at the time he was writing his biography. For four weeks reporters credited Mr. terHorst (pronounced terHORST) — and the new president and his staff — with restoring openness and honesty to the White House after having dealt with a Nixon administration that they had often felt was deliberately misleading them. The Watergate affair — the break-in at the offices of the Democratic opposition by a White House team of burglars and the Nixon administration’s attempts to cover up that crime — had its roots in this culture of suspicion and secretiveness that was fostered by the Nixon White House, and it was still being investigated by an independent prosecutor when Ford took office. Indeed, a number of top administration officials, including Attorney General John N. Mitchell; the White House chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman; and Nixon’s top domestic policy adviser, John D. Ehrlichman; went to prison for Watergate-related crimes. In early September, however, Ford announced that he was pardoning Nixon, saying that to pursue criminal charges against the former president would be detrimental to the interests of the country. Mr. terHorst felt not only that the decision was wrong — the president should not be held to a different standard of justice than people of a lesser station, he said — but also that he had been kept in the dark about it, which he said had undermined his credibility. “I cannot in good conscience support your decision to pardon former President Nixon even before he has been charged with the commission of any crime,” Mr. terHorst wrote to Ford in his resignation letter on Sept. 8, 1974. “As your spokesman, I do not know how I could credibly defend that action in the absence of a like decision to grant absolute pardon to the young men who evaded Vietnam military service as a matter of conscience and the absence of pardons for former aides and associates of Mr. Nixon who have been charged with crimes — and imprisoned — stemming from the same Watergate situation.” Jerald Franklin terHorst was born in Grand Rapids, Mich., on July 11, 1922, the son of Dutch immigrants. He did not speak English until he was 5. He dropped out of high school at 15 to work on his uncle’s farm but was eventually persuaded to resume his education by the high school principal. He went on to earn an agriculture scholarship to Michigan State University, where he worked on the school newspaper. Before finishing college, he joined the Marines and served in the Pacific at the end of World War II, then completed his college career at the University of Michigan. After graduating he took a job as a reporter for The Grand Rapids Press. His wife, the former Louise Roth, whom he had met at Michigan State and married in 1945, took a job at the rival paper, The Grand Rapids Herald. He subsequently worked for The Detroit News, first in its Lansing bureau, then in the city room and finally the Washington bureau. The paper granted him a leave of absence to take his White House job, and after his resignation he returned to the paper as a columnist. His book about Ford, “Gerald Ford and the Future of the Presidency,” was published at the end of 1974, with an epilogue about Mr. terHorst’s resignation. Ron Nessen, a correspondent for NBC News, succeeded him as White House press secretary. In 1981, Mr. terHorst left journalism to work for the Ford Motor Company as Washington public affairs director. Louise Roth terHorst died last year. In addition to his son, who lives in Asheville, Mr. terHorst is survived by three daughters, Karen Morris, of Decatur, Ga.; Margaret Robinson, of Alexandria, Va.; and Martha Lubin, of St. Petersburg, Fla.; and eight grandchildren. Shortly after his resignation, Mr. terHorst was asked by The New York Times to elaborate on his reasons. “If justice is to be even-handed and administered to the rich and the poor, the weak and the powerful alike,” he replied, “then mercy, I thought, when administered by a president who sets the tone for the country, also should be an act of similar kind.”",

    "source": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Are Winning Votes, but Not Hearts <eos> The victories were lopsided. The celebrations were effusive. The delegates were piling up by the hundreds. But Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton’s resounding triumphs on Tuesday masked a profound, historic and unusual reality: Most Americans still don’t like him. Or her. Both major parties must now confront the depth of skepticism, resistance and distaste for their front-runners, a sentiment that would profoundly shape a potential general election showdown between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. Even as they watched the two candidates amass large margins on Tuesday, historians and strategists struggled to recall a time when more than half the country has held such stubbornly low opinions of the leading figures in the Democratic and Republican Parties. “There is no analogous election in the modern era where the two top candidates for the nomination are as divisive and weak,” said Steve Schmidt, a top campaign adviser to George W. Bush in 2004 and John McCain in 2008. “There is no precedent for it.” Mrs. Clinton’s commanding wins in the swing states of Ohio, North Carolina and Florida seemed to hobble the once robust challenge of Senator Bernie Sanders. And Mr. Trump’s dominance in Florida, North Carolina and Illinois knocked out Senator Marco Rubio and propelled Mr. Trump even closer to the Republican nomination. This would be the moment, under normal circumstances, when the de facto nominees, emerging victorious from the intramural skirmishes of their parties’ nominating contests, would invite an eager national electorate to take their measure. And in their victory speeches, both tried their best, issuing broad appeals for Americans to unite behind them. But Mr. Trump has unnerved many Americans with his inflammatory oratory and radical-sounding proposals. And Mrs. Clinton, while viewed as a more seasoned and serious political figure, has struggled in her campaign to win the trust of the American electorate. And it is all but impossible for the country to take a fresh look at them. Image The Trump Ballroom at Mar-a-Lago before Donald J. Trump held an election night news conference in Palm Beach, Fla., on Tuesday. The candidate has unnerved many Americans with his inflammatory oratory and radical-sounding proposals. Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times America has lived with Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, in a remarkably intimate fashion, for decades, processing their controversies, achievements and setbacks, from impeachment to marital breakdowns, Senate victories to flashy skyscraper openings. Voters’ impressions of them, with few exceptions, are largely formed and fixed. According to Gallup, 53 percent of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Mrs. Clinton and 63 percent have such a view of Mr. Trump. “You are talking about two universally known figures here,” said David Axelrod, the former Democratic strategist and former adviser in the Obama White House. “The strong feeling that each generates is unusual.” The negative perceptions will be difficult to overcome. Fewer than half of Republican voters across five states on Tuesday said Mr. Trump was honest and trustworthy. Even in the states where he won, a majority of voters do not view him as truthful. And while majorities of Democratic voters viewed Mrs. Clinton as honest and trustworthy, she finished second to Mr. Sanders among those who said honesty mattered most in their decision. Video A look at the speeches from the presidential hopefuls after a day of crucial primaries. Credit Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times That reality is forcing the Trump and Clinton campaigns to prepare for all-out warfare against each other, an improbably brutal dynamic for a pair of New Yorkers whose paths have crossed, repeatedly, for years — even on the way down the wedding aisle. (Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, attended Mr. Trump’s third wedding, in 2005.) They are devising appeals that are as much arguments that their all-but-certain opponent would be disastrous for the nation as they are messages trumpeting their own virtues or character. Aides to both predict that a Clinton-Trump contest would be an ugly and unrelenting slugfest, as she pounces on his business practices and personal integrity, portraying him as unscrupulous robber baron, and he lacerates her over ethical lapses and sudden riches, painting her as a conniving abuser of power certain to be indicted in a federal investigation. There is, both sides concede, plenty of material to mine, stretching back to 1980s Arkansas (for her) and 1970s New York (for him). Five States Go to Polls 12 Photos View Slide Show › Image Jim Wilson/The New York Times Voters are strikingly familiar with the candidates’ biographical vulnerabilities and political liabilities, interviews show, and they express disapproval in vivid, sweeping terms. Kent Moore, 51, a Democrat from Charlotte, N.C., does not simply dislike Mrs. Clinton. He doubts her basic values.“She has no moral center,” Mr. Moore said. He ticks off past sins: She favored free trade agreements that have killed American jobs, he said, and she supported the misbegotten 2003 war in Iraq. How, he wondered, could she beat Mr. Trump with a record like that? Even those who vote for Mrs. Clinton harbor reservations. Renee White, 31, a Democrat in Youngstown, Ohio, is not entirely convinced that Mrs. Clinton, her choice in Tuesday’s primary, cares about people like her, she said. “A lot of people,” she said, “just don’t trust her at all.” The views of Mr. Trump from Republicans are almost equally uncharitable and unwavering. “Too crude and rude,” is how Nikki Heath, 59, a graphic artist from the Columbus, Ohio, area put it. She supports the state’s low-key, genial governor, John Kasich. She has written off Mr. Trump and his antics as “an embarrassment.” The distaste is so strong that voters speak of a radical transformation (or personality transplant) required for them to consider backing Mr. Trump. “He’s going to have to be completely different,” said Steve Rogers, an engineer in Ohio who will try to hold his nose and back him if he becomes the nominee. Those dim assessments are not isolated, which is why the commanding tallies that Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton have collected are pushing both parties into uncharted waters. Should they clinch the nomination, it would represent the first time in at least a quarter-century that majorities of Americans held negative views of both the Democratic and Republican candidates at the same time. The highest unfavorability rating for any nominee or front-runner was 57 percent, for the elder George Bush, in October 1992, as he emerged from a difficult first term in the White House. But his Democratic rival, Mr. Clinton, was widely liked: Just 38 percent viewed him unfavorably, according to Gallup. The unpopularity of Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton is prompting Republicans and Democrats to weigh unusual considerations at the ballot box. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who sought the Republican nomination for president in 1980 and served as an independent governor of Connecticut in the 1990s, said he held Mrs. Clinton in low regard. But he holds Mr. Trump in even greater contempt. “I don’t like her,” Mr. Weicker said, “but I am sure going to vote for her over Trump.”",

    "source": "Texas Candidate Says She Ended Pregnancies <eos> AUSTIN, Tex. — Wendy Davis, the Democratic candidate for governor, reveals in a new campaign memoir that she terminated two pregnancies for medical reasons in the 1990s, including one in which the fetus had developed a severe brain abnormality. Ms. Davis writes in “Forgetting to be Afraid” that she had an abortion in 1996 after an examination revealed that the brain of the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides. She also describes ending an earlier ectopic pregnancy, in which an embryo implants outside the uterus. Ms. Davis disclosed the terminated pregnancies for the first time since her nearly 13-hour filibuster last year over a tough new Texas abortion law. Both pregnancies happened before Ms. Davis, a state senator from Fort Worth, began her political career and after she was a mother to two young girls. She writes that the ectopic pregnancy happened in 1994 during her first trimester. Terminating the pregnancy was considered medically necessary. Such pregnancies generally are not considered viable, meaning the fetus cannot survive, and the mother’s life could be in danger. But Ms. Davis wrote that in Texas, it is “technically considered an abortion, and doctors have to report it as such.” Ms. Davis said she and her former husband, Jeff, wound up expecting another child in 1996 after they decided to stop birth-control measures. During her second trimester, Ms. Davis said she took a blood test that could determine chromosomal or neural defects, which doctors first told her did not warrant concern. After a later exam revealed the brain defect, Ms. Davis said she sought opinions from several doctors, who told her the baby would be deaf, blind and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery. “I could feel her little body tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do,” Ms. Davis writes. “She was suffering.” She wrote that an “indescribable blackness followed” the pregnancy and that the loss left her forever changed. Ms. Davis catapulted to national Democratic stardom after her filibuster temporarily delayed passage of sweeping new abortion restrictions. She is now running for governor against the Republican attorney general, Greg Abbott, who is a heavy favorite to replace Gov. Rick Perry, also a Republican, next year. A spokesman for Ms. Davis, Zac Petkanas, called the book “a bold and brave memoir that is less about politics than it is a stunningly frank personal story.” Matt Hirsch, a spokesman for Mr. Abbott, did not return messages seeking comment. Anti-abortion groups, including those that have attacked Ms. Davis’s candidacy, expressed sympathy for the tough choice she confronted with the second terminated pregnancy. “That’s an incredibly difficult position for anyone to find themselves in,” said Melissa Conway, a spokeswoman for Texans Right to Life. “While our heart goes out for the decision she had to make, again, still the value of life is precious,” The president of Planned Parenthood, Cecile Richards, daughter of former Gov. Ann Richards of Texas, said she was grateful that Ms. Davis shared her story, though “no woman should have to justify her decision.” Ms. Davis’s filibuster in June 2013 set off a chaotic scene in the Texas Capitol that extended past midnight. Thousands of people watched it live online, with President Obama at one point posting on Twitter, “Something special is happening in Austin tonight.” In the book, Ms. Davis recalls reading testimony during the filibuster about a woman who had had an abortion after learning her daughter would be born with a terminal illness. She said the story hit a little too close to home, and “could have been my story.” The bill Ms. Davis was fighting to block required doctors who perform abortion to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, and mandated that clinics upgrade facilities to hospital-level operating standards. A federal judge in Austin last month blocked a portion of the law that would have left Texas with only seven abortion facilities statewide.",

    "source": "Richard J. Durrell, First Publisher of People Magazine, Dies at 82 <eos> Richard J. Durrell, the founding publisher of People magazine, died on Friday at his home in Fairfield, Conn. He was 82. The cause was lung cancer, his son, Brad Durrell, said. Mr. Durrell’s long career at the magazine publishing giant Time Inc. began in 1950 when he answered a newspaper ad for a circulation newsstand representative in Minneapolis. He later worked in advertising for both Time and Life magazines before being named publisher of People. A blend, then unique, of pictures, celebrity features and human-interest articles, People hit the streets in March 1974 with the actress Mia Farrow, who was starring in the movie “The Great Gatsby,” gracing its first cover. While it was initially a bit of a bomb among critics, the magazine was an instant hit among readers. “We were all newsstand sales then — no subscriptions at all — and we promised we were going to sell a million copies of this magazine on the newsstand,” recalled Richard B. Stolley, People’s first managing editor. “That was unheard-of at the time. We had no idea what we were talking about. It was wonderful how naïve we were.” While the first few issues missed the million-sales mark, the magazine did hit its target in July that year. An issue with the actor Telly Savalas on the cover was the first to surpass one million in sales after Mr. Durrell created a distribution group inside Time to get enough copies of the magazine on newsstands each week, Mr. Stolley said. Persuading advertisers to place ads was another challenge, because People was such a departure from the other more male-oriented magazines published by Time Inc., including Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated. Slowly but surely, important advertisers at the time like Polaroid and Revlon were signed. Within 18 months of its introduction, People was turning a profit. “For Durrell and the business side of the publication, that was a great accomplishment,” Mr. Stolley said. Mr. Durrell, who retired in 1983, was a baseball’s throw away from an entirely different career. After graduating from high school in Minneapolis in 1942, he enlisted and served three years with the Marines and spent time in occupied Japan. Upon his return to the States, he was offered professional baseball contracts with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs. He chose, instead, to attend the University of Minnesota, from which he graduated in 1948. He married Jacquelyn C. Dow in 1949. She is a former first selectman of Fairfield. In addition to his wife and son Brad, of Morris, Conn., Mr. Durrell is survived by another son, Alex, of Fairfield; three daughters, Piper Durrell, of Blacksburg, Va.; Robyn Geissler, of Mill Valley, Calif.; and Kerry Durrell, of San Diego; a sister, Lois Anne Anderson, of Sun Valley, Idaho; and seven grandchildren.",

    "source": "Hong Kong Lawmaker Pays Price for Breaking Ranks With Beijing <eos> HONG KONG — A Hong Kong lawmaker who broke ranks with his pro-Beijing allies by calling last week for the resignation of the city’s top official faces expulsion from a prestigious Chinese government advisory panel as punishment for his disloyalty, his brother said Tuesday. The lawmaker, James Tien, the leader of the Liberal Party, is set to be expelled from the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference for not supporting its resolutions, which include backing Hong Kong’s government, Mr. Tien’s brother, Michael, said in a telephone interview. The body’s standing committee will meet Wednesday to vote on the issue, said Michael Tien, also a Hong Kong lawmaker. “The oath made when being appointed is that they would vow to uphold all the resolutions made by the standing committee of the C.P.P.C.C.,” said Michael Tien, a delegate to China ’s legislature, the National People’s Congress. “So they considered him as not honoring his oath.” The swift response is a signal that Beijing backs Leung Chun-ying, Hong Kong’s chief executive, even as public support for him dwindles during student-led pro-democracy protests. Mr. Leung’s handling of the demonstrations, which have occupied busy avenues of the city, has been heavily criticized by democracy advocates, many of whom are calling for his resignation. James Tien echoed that sentiment on Friday, saying in a radio interview that Mr. Leung’s leadership had been poor. It was the first time a prominent member of the pro-business establishment had called for Mr. Leung to quit. Michael Tien said that there were “corridors of discontent” in Beijing over Mr. Leung’s performance, but that officials thought it was important to support him because if he were removed, it would be a contravention of the “one country, two systems” model promised to Hong Kong when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997 after more than 150 years as a British colony. Image James Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, had called for Hong Kong’s leader to resign. Credit Bobby Yip/Reuters “They are supporting C. Y. because they are supporting the system and structure,” Michael Tien said, referring to Mr. Leung. A report in Sing Tao Daily, a local newspaper, also said the body’s standing committee would meet Wednesday to vote on the expulsion. The body, which advises the National People’s Congress, comprises over 2,000 delegates drawn from a broad range of society, including many billionaire executives but also Buddhist monks, professional athletes, scientists, soldiers and professors. Under China’s Leninist system, they must share one trait: loyalty to the central government led by the Communist Party. Members serve five-year terms and can be reappointed. Hong Kong runs most of its internal affairs but still sends delegates to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and the National People’s Congress. Hong Kong’s delegation represents the elite of the government’s supporters. Michael Tien said that members of the body were free to voice their opposition to policies before a decision was made, but that afterward, they had to support the choice. “Whether you think this is right or wrong, this is the oath that you made,” he said. James Tien, 67, has a reputation as a maverick. In 2003, he withdrew the Liberal Party’s support of a government-backed security bill, ensuring its defeat. Michael Tien said his brother might be able to keep his status as a member of the so-called pro-establishment camp in Hong Kong and not be viewed as a member of the opposition. James Tien did not return a phone call and an email seeking comment. Mr. Leung, 60, stirred a new controversy last week when he told The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times that allowing lower-income people equal representation in elections would lead to a “numbers game” that would skew “politics and policies” in favor of lower-income groups. Those remarks have been pilloried by the pro-democracy demonstrators. On Tuesday, Mr. Leung said he regretted that his remarks had caused misunderstanding, The South China Morning Post reported.",

    "source": "Sufi Sect of Islam Draws ‘Spiritual Vagabonds’ in New York <eos> On a leafy block of West 72nd Street, a Muslim Sufi order meets each Thursday evening, squeezing into Abdul Latif’s three-bedroom apartment. You don’t have to know Mr. Latif, born John Healy, to attend. Raised in the Yorkville neighborhood on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, he greeted his guests in Arabic with a thick New York accent, inviting them to sit on the floor. A group of about 10 beloveds, as they call one another, then stood and locked hands, forming a circle. Mr. Latif, 57, weaved around the ring, leading the chants in unison, including the 99 sacred names of God and prayers of adoration. The participants — mostly American-born converts to Islam — squeezed their eyes shut; some gently swayed, letting themselves be carried away by the rhythmic mantras. The pace of the chants quickened, one man stamped his feet, another wept silently, and after 30 minutes the beloveds were captivated and perspiring. Sufis call this practice zikr and see it as a way of connecting with God and elevating themselves through communal meditation. Worshipers frequently lose themselves in a spinning frenzy, as with the well-known whirling dervishes. Sufism, a mystical branch of Islam , has been cloaked in secrecy for most of its existence, having been forced underground by Ottoman rulers in the 13th century. Nowadays, however, many of these spiritual communities, like the beloveds in Mr. Latif’s apartment, are in plain view around the city if you know where to look. Some can even be found through a simple Google search. The Murid order, for instance, meets in West Harlem and follows the teachings of its Senegalese founder, Ahmadu Bamba. The Tijaniyya group congregates on Fridays in a brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. The Naqshbandis meet on Saturday nights in a 19th-century church on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan. Ahmad Khan Rahami, the New Jersey man whom the authorities blame for the Sept. 17 bombing in Manhattan, which prosecutors have said injured 31 people, is believed to have been inspired by radical Islam . American Muslims’ condemnations of the attack were immediate, but some were accompanied by concern that it could provoke anti-Muslim hysteria. Image Abdul Latif leading chanting by the Sufi group that meets in his apartment on the Upper West Side. Credit Nicole Craine for The New York Times The Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, a civil liberties organization, issued a statement that said, “Our nation is most secure when we remain united and reject the fear-mongering and guilt by association often utilized following such attacks.” Annmarie Agosta, who grew up in an Italian-American family in Brooklyn and became a Sufi in 2009 after exploring Paganism, Wicca and Buddhism, seemed to agree with this statement. “I feel a deep responsibility to stand for the true message of Islam, which is peace, tolerance, and compassion,” Ms. Agosta said. “This is the message of Sufism.” As a lesbian advocate for gay rights and a member of a congregation in TriBeCa, she led a service to honor those killed in the Orlando, Fla., massacre this summer. Many Americans anxious about domestic terrorism, however, are not interested in the nuances of various branches of Islam. And paradoxically, Sufis are often shunned by conservative Islam — the sect is dismissed as a diluted version of the faith, prioritizing the esoteric over the orthodox. “Sufism has never been embraced by mainstream Islam,” said Daisy Khan, founder of the Women’s Islamic Initiative in Spirituality and Equality and one-half of the couple who in 2010 sought to open a community center in Lower Manhattan, mislabeled the “ground zero mosque.” For Ms. Khan, the ethereal buzz of Sufism is its great appeal, a faith that is “beyond the realm of this world,” dealing with the “supernatural, the magical and love.” “Despite bad press,” she said, “people are still becoming Muslim and Sufi.” It is an interesting time to choose to become a Sufi. Before he became a beloved among Mr. Latif’s group on the Upper West Side, Bjorn Bolinder had come to New York from Minnesota with dreams of performing on Broadway. His father was a Baptist minister, and his childhood consisted of regular church services and Sunday school. “I didn’t feel connected to the divine there,” he said. “I had no experience of joy or aliveness.” He began seeking religion for himself in his mid-20s and came across Sufism through self-help spirituality books and a healing therapist. Mr. Bolinder, now 39, described an early spiritual moment as a downpour of light so bright that he had to open his eyes to double-check that the room lighting had not changed. “I suddenly realized that maybe this is God, not whatever I learned in church,” he said. “I felt like a completely different person. It was just so beautiful.” Image Chanting at the weekly gathering of a Sufi group led by Abdul Latif. Credit Nicole Craine for The New York Times Over the next few years, between auditions for acting roles, Mr. Bolinder continued his spiritual exploration, fasting, learning prayers and attending conventions. Most of Mr. Latif’s Upper West Side group regularly attended a Sufi retreat in Pope Valley, Calif., where the beloveds would meet with their grand sheikh, Sidi Muhammad Al-Jamal, a Palestinian cleric who died in November at 80. This is where Mr. Bolinder and other members took their “Sufi promise,” a pledge of allegiance to their teacher and God in a formal ceremony, in return receiving their Sufi names. Mr. Bolinder’s is Abdullah. Tall and blond, Mr. Bolinder doesn’t dress in a way that identifies him as a Sufi or a Muslim, although he occasionally thumbs his prayer beads on the subway. But having a Sufi name makes him part of a spiritual community. Five years after his “coming out as a Sufi,” he said, his parents are supportive, and his father has even taken a Sufi course on Jesus, who appears as a prophet in the Quran. “I feel sad for Muslims who don’t acknowledge Sufism as part of the breadth of the divine,” Mr. Bolinder said. “We are all one. They’re missing out.” Sufism cuts across all sects of the faith. “You can be a Shia or a Sunni or any type of Muslim and still be a Sufi,” said James W. Morris, professor of Islamic thought and history at Boston College. Often caricatured as kumbaya hippies, Sufis seek divine love and connection, but their practices encompass strict worldly rules and commitments: long services, dawn and night prayers, rigorous meditation and frequent fasting — in addition to the common Islamic practices of five daily prayers, the hajj pilgrimage and abstention from alcohol. Sufis cluster into tarikas, or spiritual orders, that are headed by a grand sheikh who may live in Cairo, but are led day to day by a local sheikh who could live in Queens. While few reliable estimates exist of the number of Sufis in America, Islam over all is rapidly growing. The Pew Research Center estimates that by 2050, Muslims will become the second-largest religious group in the United States , after Christians, totaling over eight million people. Discussing that growth, Khalid Latif, chaplain of the Islamic Center at New York University, said that in the city, “there’s an absence of spirituality and stillness,” and that even in times of heightened anxiety in the West about Muslims, the center saw a steady stream of the curious. He said that for many Americans, Sufism was an appealing first step. Image Sheikha Fariha al-Jerrah, center in 2005, who became a Sufi in the 1970s and now leads the Nur Jerrahi order. Credit James Estrin/The New York Times Tourists and shoppers in TriBeCa could easily miss the discreet blue plaque on a three-story building on West Broadway between a tavern and a brasserie. It reads, “Dergah Nur Ashki Jerrahi Sufi Order.” Inside is where New Yorkers are most likely to encounter whirling dervishes. Visitors, once they have removed their shoes, enter a prayer hall with a high ceiling and ornate green and gold Arabic calligraphy spelling out the Prophet Muhammad’s name decorating the walls. Books and prayer rugs are strewed about, and a table is laden with sweet Turkish tea and dates. A woman’s voice drifts across the hall, performing the public call to prayer — a role traditionally reserved for men. What makes the order most unusual is that its local sheikh is a woman: the former Philippa de Menil, 69, part of Texas oil aristocracy . She became a Sufi in the 1970s, and, now known as Sheikha Fariha al-Jerrahi, has led the Nur Jerrahi order since its founder’s death in 1995. Wearing a flowing white gown, her hair half-wrapped in a blue turban, Sheikha Fariha completes the call to prayer and summons the group’s members to stand side by side, avoiding the more orthodox Islamic practice of positioning men up front. Sheikha Fariha gives few interviews, and she declined to speak to a reporter, but her longtime secretary, Abdul Rahim, answered questions about the congregation. A female sheikh shouldn’t be viewed as unusual, said Mr. Rahim, who was born Thomas Rippe and grew up in Brooklyn. “We don’t put an emphasis on women; we emphasize equality,” he said. “We think of it as a certain kind of maturity.” The order has no dress code and no rules on sexual orientation. Indeed, the order is so liberal that some members don’t even label themselves as Muslims. This kind of unorthodox approach, said Marcia Hermansen, director of the Islamic world studies program at Loyola University Chicago, is both the root of Sufism’s appeal and its weakness. Charismatic leaders like Sheikha Fariha have spurred Sufism’s growth in America, she said, with New York in particular attracting “loosey-goosey liberal Sufism.” And yet for all its liberal trappings, Sufism cannot be detached from Islam. “Sufism isn’t just a label you wear; it’s a state of being,” said John Andrew Morrow, an Islam scholar and author. “You can’t pick and choose parts of Islam, and you can’t mislead sincere people, drawing them into Sufism without telling them this is fundamentally linked to Islam.” Image Mr. Latif holding prayer beads, called Misbahah. Credit Nicole Craine for The New York Times Part of this problem, he said, is the American tradition of “spiritual vagabonds.” “They bounce around from one spiritual tradition to another,” he said, “like going to a buffet.” Like the Shadhili group on the Upper West Side, Jerrahi members participate in long zikr services; theirs last until the wee hours. During a recent session, members formed a sitting circle, perched on low wooden stools and placed their hands on their hearts, swaying as they sang a communal tune. One man lightly tapped out a beat on a Persian drum; another young woman passed around a hymnbook, in English, so that newcomers could sing along. A few late worshipers trickled in and joined the circle, hastily removing their shoes and respectfully bowing in the direction of Sheikha Fariha, who had the bearing of a slightly bossy school principal. During the service, one man discreetly made to leave the room. Her eyes tightly closed, legs crossed and back straight, Sheikha Fariha snapped, “Where are you going?” The man jumped at being noticed and sheepishly replied, “To the restroom.” She dismissed him with a wave of her hand without ever opening her eyes. Sitting on the floor of the main prayer hall was Juliet Rabia Gentile, 36, who has belonged to this order for more than a decade. “I was always interested in Sufi culture: music, dance, art and the works of the Persian poets Rumi and Hafez,” Ms. Gentile said. “It was definitely more of a cultural rather than spiritual interest at first.” Her upbringing in New York City was Christian. “Initially, my family thought I was experimenting and it would probably go away after a couple of years,” she said. “Certain friends were surprised I’d become a Muslim, especially post-9/11.” The group’s female leadership was a lure for Ms. Gentile, who is proud that American Sufism has cultivated an atmosphere of acceptance. “Our sheikha is an unusual product of American religious freedoms,” she said. But she is also aware that Sufis are in a difficult position, both within Islam and within American culture. “Sufis nowadays are under attack and called heretics,” she said. “It’s ironic given all the Islamophobia, there’s been a surge of growth of interest. People just want to understand.” Ms. Gentile doesn’t wear the headscarf outside the Dergah. “I can sense that the vibe here is changing,” she said. “Americans have reached heightened paranoia in the two years since ISIS emerged. People are becoming irrational.” She said her fellow New Yorkers were less likely to be swayed by panic. But she is nonetheless wary. “Fear is a strong drug,” she said.",

    "source": "Turkey to Alter Speech Law <eos> IZMIR, Turkey — When Atilla Yayla, a maverick political science professor, offered a mild criticism of Turkey’s first years as a country, his remarks unleashed a torrent of abuse. “Traitor!” a newspaper headline shouted. His college dismissed him. State prosecutors in this western city, where he spoke, opened a criminal case against him. His crime? Violating an obscure law against insulting the legacy of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , Turkey’s founder. “I need thoughts to counter my ideas,” Mr. Yayla said. “Instead they attacked me.” Turkey’s government has taken on the issue of free speech and is expected as early as Friday to announce a weakening of a law against insulting Turkishness, an amendment that is considered a key measure of the democratic maturity of this Muslim country as it tries to gain acceptance to the European Union . But while that law, called Article 301, is known to many in the West — Orhan Pamuk , the Nobel Prize -winning Turkish novelist, was prosecuted under 301 — it is just one of many laws that limit freedom of expression for intellectuals in Turkey. The law under which Mr. Yayla was prosecuted, for example, dates from 1951 and is not even part of the penal code. While the change in Article 301 is likely to stop the wanton application of that law, the single most common statute used against critics of Turkey’s official line, the government was unable to remove it from the books completely, as liberals here had wanted. The reason goes to the heart of the state of Turkey today: Despite its booming economy, gay pride parades and ambitious European aspirations, a large part of Turkish society is deeply conservative. When it comes to free speech, many Turks support the limitations. As nationalism has been rising in Turkey in response to the broad changes sweeping society, so have the number of court cases against writers, publishers and academics. The European Union, in a report in November, said the number of such people prosecuted almost doubled in 2006 over the year before, and rose further in 2007. In all, about 39 articles limit free expression in Turkey, though only 13 are commonly used, said Zafer Gokdemir, a rights lawyer who has represented defendants in these cases since 1995. The laws are deeply damaging, liberals argue, because they block society’s thinkers from asking the difficult questions needed to overcome a painful past. Turkey was born fighting for its life against European powers that were carving it up at the end of World War I. It was left defensive, with low self-esteem and weak institutions, and a deep-seated insecurity lingers. But unlike Russians who were cynical about the Soviet state, most Turks strongly believe in their system. Nationalist taboos on questioning official history are held in place as much by society as by Turkey’s controlling state. The legal complaints, for that reason, emerge from the most insecure part of society: a nationalist, sometimes violent fringe, whose political backers are the staunchly secular old guard. With vast power, but limited public accountability, that old guard is not unlike senior Soviet apparatchiks. The heart of this class works in the military, an elite institution in Turkey, and in the judiciary. In Turkey’s court system, any private citizen can file a complaint, requiring prosecutors to investigate, and a vast majority of the freedom of expression cases begin that way. An ultranationalist lawyer who started the case against Mr. Pamuk, Kemal Kerincsiz, said in an interview that he had gotten about 50 cases opened since 2005. Mr. Yayla’s speech, in 2006 at a youth conference in Izmir, drew eight complaints, including one from the Izmir Bar Association, according to his lawyer, Nalan Erkem. Mr. Yayla’s argument — that the early years of the republic were less democratic than the period after Turkey became a multiparty system, and that Ataturk’s monopoly on public images would be perplexing to Europeans — “had no basis in science,” said Huseyin Durdu, a Turkish patriot lawyer and a complainant. Asked what would happen if the law were rescinded, Mr. Durdu looked stricken. “People would be insulting each other,” he said, in an immaculate office in downtown Izmir, a small bust of Ataturk on the wall behind him. “It would be conflict and chaos.” Mr. Yayla, for his part, said he was simply trying to provoke a thoughtful discussion on the monopoly of political symbols. “Of course we need to have Ataturk statues, but there are other people in Turkish history, and they deserve statues, too,” he said by telephone. In a surprising twist, Turkey’s class of religious Muslims — deeply despised by the secular old guard primarily because it is considered a serious threat to the old guard’s power — has pushed to weaken the laws. President Abdullah Gul has said that Article 301 has been as damaging to Turkey’s reputation as “Midnight Express,” a 1978 film about an American drug smuggler brutalized in a Turkish prison. The old guard, which professes to stand for Western values but in fact is deeply suspicious of the freedoms they would bring, deftly places obstacles in the path of the religious class by invoking the specter of extremism. Mr. Yayla, who cites John Stuart Mill and John Locke, is harder for the old guard to trip up. Indeed, Mr. Yayla’s speech was so scholarly that the only thing his critics found to charge him with formally was referring to Ataturk as “this man.” (For reference, in the Turkish Constitution, he is described as the “immortal leader and unrivaled hero.”) The prosecutions result in suspended sentences, fines, closings of publishing houses, but rarely jail time. Even so, they have chilled free speech. Public trials go for months and draw leering ultranationalists. Last year one turned lethal when a nationalist teenage gunman killed Hrant Dink, a Turkish-Armenian journalist. Mr. Yayla is now in self-imposed exile in Britain, even though his job in Turkey was reinstated. Before leaving, he moved around with a bodyguard. The convictions that sometimes do carry jail time are often against Kurds. An arsenal of laws relating to the charge of terrorism is aimed at Kurdish writers, publishers and artists. “When you use the word Kurd or Kurdistan, you are conducting terrorist propaganda, no matter what you are saying,” said Ahmet Onal, a Kurdish publisher of 270 books, for which he has stood trial 27 times and served prison terms twice. The issue of Kurds is delicate because Turkey has been warring with a militant fringe of its Kurdish population since the 1980s, and the lines between expression and revolt are blurry. For years the old guard refused to acknowledge its Kurds as a distinct population. Many Turks say European countries should be more understanding of Turkey, a far younger state than many, with bigger problems. European democracy is a “thornless garden,” said Umit Kocasakal, a lawyer. Besides, he says, Europeans have similar laws restricting speech. Articles 90A and 90B in Germany prohibit disparaging the state, its symbols and constitutional institutions, and Article 290 of the Italian penal code prohibits vilifying the republic and its military. But application in Europe is extremely rare. In Italy the only punishment is a fine. The laws in Turkey may be frustratingly tenacious but besides the amendment, the government is fighting back in its own way. It detained more than 30 ultranationalists with shady ties to the old guard on Tuesday in an operation that thrilled liberals. Among those detained was Mr. Kerincsiz, who had opened the cases against Mr. Pamuk and Mr. Dink. Mr. Yayla spends his days reading in Britain. He says it feels good to pore over pages about the possibility of free societies in Muslim countries. Despite Turkish liberals’ fight with the rigid, dying old guard, it is the new religious class that seems certain to determine the future of democracy in Turkey, and Mr. Yayla says he wants to be prepared. “I am an individualist,” he said. “I believe in the value of human beings. I don’t like insulting people. I can usually make my point without it.”",

    "source": "Nautical Sprint Into Danger <eos> It has been 30 years since the Fastnet sailing race turned deadly, just two years since it turned very dangerous. And on Sunday off Cowes on the Isle of Wight, Mike Slade plans to take the helm of ICAP Leopard, his 100-foot maxi with the canting keel, and steer with the peace of mind that comes with being aboard one of the biggest, most weatherproof yachts in the regatta. “I’ve nothing but admiration for those who do this race in small boats in bad conditions,” Slade said. “You wouldn’t catch me doing that for all the tea in China. What can I tell you? I’m not proud.” But Slade, an ebullient 62-year-old property developer with a booming laugh that could cut through the fog of his home city of London, is very proud of what his imposing yacht managed to do in nasty weather during the last Fastnet, in 2007. With other yachts, including maxis, withdrawing from the race in droves because of high winds and big waves in the English Channel and beyond, Slade and his largely professional crew did much more than ride out the storm. Leopard shattered the race’s speed record by nearly nine hours to take line honors in a time of one day, 20 hours and 18 minutes. “I’d be very surprised if we ever beat that,” Slade said. “We were just lucky with the breeze and the angle and strength of the breeze at the time.” The Fastnet, one of the world’s traditional offshore challenges, once guaranteed its victors multiple nights at sea and an endurance test, but Slade’s new-generation yacht transformed the 608-mile, or 980-kilometer, test into a nautical sprint. “We’re getting even small boats now that are able to go very fast,” said Eddie Warden-Owen, veteran sailor and chief executive of the Royal Ocean Racing Club, which organizes the event. “The race has changed and evolved over the years, but for me, it’s still one of the classics. It has a toughness very different from Sydney-Hobart, because you have to go there and back. And you’ve got headlands and strong tidal currents to deal with.” The Fastnet is not quite there and back. It leaves from Cowes, rounds the Fastnet Rock off the southern coast of Ireland and then returns to the port of Plymouth, England. The race was the brainchild of a British sailor with the unsettling name of Weston Martyr. It was first staged in 1925 with seven starters, only four of whom finished the race. Over the decades, it has become the biennial, offshore exclamation point to the inshore festivities of Cowes Week. The Fastnet’s overall winners — meaning winners on corrected time — have included the Frenchman Éric Tabarly in 1967, the Australian Syd Fischer in 1971 and the driven American entrepreneur Ted Turner in 1979. But for all Turner’s celebrity, 1979 will always evoke much darker images, because of the disaster that left 15 competitors dead after an unexpected storm struck the fleet when many of the smaller yachts had already advanced well into the Celtic Sea. The repercussions would rumble through the sport for years, creating new standards for safety and boat design. Such moves surely saved lives but did not avert another disaster at the Sydney-Hobart race in 1998, when six more sailors died in the 80-knot winds and 18-meter, or 60-foot, waves generated by a storm off Australia. The irony is that both races grew in prominence because of the global attention focused on the tragedies. But the Fastnet, where light winds are more the rule, has happily not experienced anything nearly so devastating in 30 years, and its sensitivity to the possibility was underscored in 2007, when, for the first time, the start was postponed a day because of weather concerns. Slade considered it an unwelcome precedent. “Once they’ve said to the outside world that they consider it’s too dangerous to start one day, they are therefore implying it’s not dangerous to start on the next day, and they’ve got to be careful on those kinds of decisions,” he said. “I much prefer race committees to be clearly not obligated to do anything other than start a race and finish a race and leave it to the individual skippers and boats to make the decisions whether it’s safe.” Warden-Owen said the delay was warranted, even if only 60 of the 271 who did start were able to finish. “By delaying it 25 hours it meant they would hit the strong winds and have an opportunity to run for cover,” he said. “If they started 25 hours earlier, they would have met the storm in the Irish Sea. It wouldn’t have been that easy for them to suddenly turn around and run home.” On Wednesday, a memorial service was held for those lost in 1979 at the Holy Trinity Church in Cowes. “All these safety measures are quite right, and the ’79 issues shouldn’t actually happen ever again, but you do get these storms at sea,” Slade said. “The Irish Sea can be a very inhospitable place, and you are talking about Atlantic conditions as you go out to the left rather than going up under Ireland and bouncing down the coasts. So all these things are big in these guys’ minds. The Fastnet race is probably the biggest race and the most dangerous race that the majority of the fleet will ever entertain.” It is a varied fleet indeed, ranging from Slade’s 100-footer to Wieslaw Krupski’s 30-foot Polish entry, Four Winds. Neither the 2007 troubles nor the economic downturn has cut into the size of the entry list this year. Though Cowes Week had to go without a title sponsor, the Fastnet still has Rolex as its title sponsor and has not, according to Warden-Owen, been impacted significantly. Since 2007, the fleet has been limited to 300 yachts, and the Fastnet filled that quota by March of this year, although numerous yachts have since come off the waiting list as entrants failed to meet qualifying standards or withdrew. The crew mix throughout the fleet remains about 90 percent amateur and 10 percent professional, but the professionals include some of yachting’s true elite. Torben Grael, the Brazilian Olympic champion and America’s Cup regular with Luna Rossa, recently skippered Ericsson 4 to victory in the round-the-world Volvo Ocean Race but will be on board Luna Rossa’s STP 65 during the Fastnet. “I think it’s one of those things where it shows you the obvious great respect he has for the Luna Rossa team,” Warden-Owen said. “He’s come away from one of the toughest ocean races he might ever have done, and suddenly they say, ‘Can you come and join us for 600 miles?’ He probably thought it was a nice day race.” Two other America’s Cup veterans from New Zealand, Gavin Brady and Ray Davies, will also take part, with Brady skippering Beau Geste, a new 80-footer from Hong Kong. Davies will call tactics for Slade, whose acquisitive eye is on another Fastnet victory but, above all, on winning Sydney-Hobart for the first time later this year. Big is not only safer but historically fast, and Slade makes no apologies. “Always you get the accusation that we’re any good because we paid for a very expensive boat and because we paid for the technology,” he said. “And I’d be the first to put my hand up. When I get into a small Laser against a bunch of kids down in Cornwall, I’m completely hopeless. I’ve never pretended that I’m a great sailor, but I do enjoy doing what I do, and I do take great pleasure out of doing it well.”",

    "source": "Putin’s Party Wins Regional Elections <eos> MOSCOW — Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin ’s governing party has won handily in regional elections, Russia ’s Central Election Commission said Monday, in his first electoral test since the economy began to turn dire. Mr. Putin’s party, United Russia, won the majority of seats in all nine regions where local parliamentary elections were held Sunday, and nearly swept smaller municipal elections. The Communist Party, which complained of widespread violations, came in a distant second. United Russia officials called the resounding victory evidence that Mr. Putin’s response to the economic crisis, including supporting the ruble and selected bailouts, had spared many Russians the ill effects of a rapidly tumbling economy. “These elections show that the steps taken by the government and the legislature are correct and directed at preventing serious impacts of the global crisis on the economic situation in Russia,” said Boris Gryzlov, the party chairman. But many independent analysts say that elections have become little more than technical exercises since Mr. Putin came to power as president in 2000 and offer only a haphazard indication of voter preference. Television and many other media outlets are largely tilted in favor of United Russia, and, out of four parties in the federal Parliament, only one, the Communist Party, offers real, if pliable, opposition to Mr. Putin’s party. “This was just a small, uninteresting show,” said Anton Orekh, a political commentator on Echo Moskvy radio. Public interest in elections, he said, has become “slightly less than low.” Still, Mr. Putin remains the country’s most popular politician. But some analysts pointed to a slight slip of several percentage points by United Russia in some regions, compared with previous elections, as an indication that increasing unemployment and rising prices have begun to take a toll on the party. The Communist Party made small gains, despite what Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader, called major violations of election laws.",

    "source": "Slight Fall in New Jobless Claims <eos> WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The number of workers submitting new claims for unemployment benefits fell slightly last week, implying only a gradual labor market improvement even as the economic recovery expands. While the data released Thursday did not change views, analysts were disappointed with how slowly claims were declining. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 448,000, the Labor Department said. That was slightly below market expectations that claims would drop to 445,000. “Some companies are still struggling and believe they can meet any increase in demand with a smaller work force,” said Paul Dales, who studies the American market for Capital Economics in Toronto. “The recovery in the labor market is probably going to be more modest than a lot of people are expecting.” The Federal Reserve this week said the labor market was improving, but noted that employers remained reluctant to add to payrolls. As expected, the central bank left overnight benchmark lending rates near zero. Economists are concerned that claims remain above 400,000, a level they say is historically associated with steady job growth. Analysts expect data next week will show the unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in April, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. The four-week moving average of new claims, seen as a more-reliable barometer of labor market trends, rose by 1,500 last week to 462,500, the department said. It was the fourth weekly increase in a row. The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell to 4.65 million in the week ended April 17, a touch above market expectations of 4.62 million.",

    "source": "Egyptian Court Sentences Ousted President Morsi to Death <eos> CAIRO — An Egyptian court on Saturday sentenced to death the deposed president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, along with more than 100 others, for fleeing prison during the 2011 revolt against President Hosni Mubarak. Mr. Morsi’s conviction is the latest sign of the undoing of the uprising that overthrew Mr. Mubarak. Mr. Morsi, who was Egypt’s first freely elected leader, now faces the death penalty for escaping extralegal detention — a form of detention that many Egyptians hoped would be eliminated by the revolution. If carried out, the sentence could make Mr. Morsi a martyr to millions of Islamists in Egypt and around the world. In a statement about the sentencing, Amr Darrag, a Muslim Brotherhood leader who was a cabinet minister under Mr. Morsi, said it was “one of the darkest days of Egyptian history” and a symbol “of the dark shadow of authoritarianism that is now cast back over Egypt.” Judge Shaaban el-Shami issued the ruling in a courtroom in a converted auditorium on the grounds of a police academy on the outskirts of Cairo. Mr. Morsi, wearing a blue prison uniform, stood inside a metal and glass cage built in the courtroom. Some of his co-defendants, including other senior Brotherhood leaders, also appeared in the cage. In a sonorous tone, the judge read a list, spanning three pages, of those sentenced to death. His pronouncement set off cries of “Allahu akbar!” (God is great) from the prisoners. As the session ended, the prisoners waved and chanted “Down with military rule!” Before they can be carried out, the death sentences must be approved by Egypt’s top Sunni Muslim religious authority, the grand mufti, who is scheduled to make a ruling by June 2. The convictions are also subject to appeal through the court system. Hours after the verdict was issued, three Egyptian judges were killed by gunmen on a bus in the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt has been shaken by an upsurge in attacks by insurgents in Sinai since Mr. Morsi was deposed by the military in 2013. It was not immediately clear whether Saturday’s attack was connected to the verdict against Mr. Morsi. The case against Mr. Morsi centers on a prison break that took place at the peak of the revolt against Mr. Mubarak. Mr. Morsi and other Brotherhood officials had been detained, taken from their homes or from street protests, along with many other Egyptians swept up in the turmoil. Mr. Morsi had been held for two days at Wadi Natroun prison, on the highway between Cairo and Alexandria. The escape came on the night of Jan. 28, 2011, after a day of street battles between the police and protesters. In the chaos of the uprising, some of the guards at Wadi Natroun had abandoned their posts. Armed men overcame the prison’s remaining guards, freeing thousands of inmates, including Mr. Morsi and other Islamist leaders. Mr. Morsi announced his escape in a call from a satellite phone to the news channel Al Jazeera. Neither before nor during his tenure as president did he face charges over the episode. Among those sentenced to death on Saturday were about 70 Palestinians, including many tried in absentia. Prosecutors in the case alleged that armed Palestinians had freed inmates from Egyptian prisons after entering the country via tunnels from the neighboring Gaza Strip. Also on Saturday, the judge sentenced 16 people to death in an espionage case in which Mr. Morsi and other Brotherhood leaders were accused of conspiring with foreign armed groups, including Hamas and the Lebanese group Hezbollah, to destabilize Egypt. Mr. Morsi was not among those condemned to death in that case. Among those referred to the mufti in the espionage case was Emad Shahin, an Egyptian political scientist now living in the United States. In the jailbreak case, the Brotherhood’s top spiritual guide, Mohamed Badie, and a former Parliament speaker, Mohamed Saad el-Katatni, were also sentenced to death. Under Egyptian law, Mr. Shahin and the others convicted in absentia are entitled to a retrial if they enter Egypt. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who had cultivated strong ties with Mr. Morsi, denounced the sentence, calling it a return to “ancient Egypt,” and he criticized Western nations for not doing enough to oppose the overthrow of Mr. Morsi. Mr. Morsi was removed from power by the military in July 2013 after protests that concluded a divisive year in office. He was held incommunicado at a secret location before reappearing during the opening of a trial months later. After Mr. Morsi’s removal from power, the state began a vast crackdown on Islamists and other dissenting voices, killing more than a thousand and arresting tens of thousands. Mona el-Ghobashy, a visiting scholar at the Institute for Religion, Culture and Public Life at Columbia University, said Mr. Morsi’s trial was part of the Egyptian authorities’ offensive against the forces of the uprising that toppled Mr. Mubarak. “The self-appointed permanent guardians of the state, judiciary and military are messaging that the revolution’s political results (free elections, civilian president, right to protest) were unnatural, unreal and unsustainable,” Ms. Ghobashy wrote in an email. “They’re saying to Egyptians: This whole business of democracy and choosing your rulers is a fantasy. That’s not the way power works here.” Sahar Aziz, an associate professor at Texas A & M School of Law, said, “In light of the politically charged environment within which the Morsi prosecutions are taking place, the perception by some may be that these trials are more about political retaliation than bona fide criminal activity.” Saturday’s ruling was the second against Mr. Morsi in less than a month. In April, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison on charges of inciting violence and overseeing the illegal detention and torture of protesters while he was in office. That case centered on a deadly street brawl between Brotherhood supporters and opponents in Cairo in 2012. He faces separate trials over charges of leaking documents, fraud and insulting the judiciary.",

    "source": "C.I.A. Leaves Pakistan Base Used for Drone Strikes <eos> ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The Central Intelligence Agency has vacated an air base in western Pakistan that it had been using for drone strikes against militants in the country’s tribal areas, the Pakistani military said on Sunday. Pakistan had ordered the C.I.A. to leave the Shamsi air base in protest over NATO airstrikes that killed at least 25 Pakistani soldiers near the border with Afghanistan on Nov. 26. Pakistan has also blocked all NATO logistical supplies from crossing the border into Afghanistan since the clash. Pentagon and Obama administration officials declined to comment publicly on the departure from the Shamsi air base. But a senior American counterterrorism official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the drone operations at Shamsi were classified, said that vacating the base would not end American counterterrorism operations in Pakistan. “The United States retains robust capabilities to fight Al Qaeda and its militant allies,” the official said. “Our operations will continue.” Pakistani officials have repeatedly accused NATO forces of deliberately attacking the Pakistani soldiers at two military check posts; American officials have said the airstrikes were an unfortunate accident. In response to the attacks, Pakistan gave the C.I.A. 15 days to vacate the Shamsi base, which is about 200 miles southwest of the city of Quetta in Baluchistan Province. Inter Services Public Relations, the media wing of the Pakistani military, said the last flight carrying American personnel and equipment left the base on Sunday. “The base has been taken over by the army,” the agency’s statement said. While United States officials do not comment publicly on drone operations against militants who plan attacks on Afghanistan from havens in the Pakistani tribal areas, operations had been reduced at the Shamsi air base since May, when a Navy Seal commando raid killed Osama bin Laden near Islamabad. The United States also carries out drone strikes from bases in Afghanistan. After the Bin Laden raid, Pakistan insisted that the C.I.A. shut down its operations at the Shamsi base, but it later relented, permitting scaled-down operations. The attacks on the Pakistani check points two weeks ago have stoked nationalist passions in the country, where anti-American sentiment was already running high. Angry demonstrations erupted after the airstrikes, and in an additional sign of protest, the Pakistani government decided not to attend an international conference on the future of Afghanistan held last week in Bonn, Germany. Although American officials have expressed hope that their working relationship with the Pakistanis will not break down, Pakistani officials have insisted on rewriting the rules of bilateral cooperation. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said Sunday in an interview with the BBC that Pakistan might continue to block NATO supply convoys from entering Afghanistan for several more weeks. “There is a credibility gap,” Mr. Gilani told the BBC. “We are working together, and still we don’t trust each other.” To build confidence, Mr. Gilani said, Pakistan is creating what he called “new rules of engagement with the United States.” “Then I think we should trust each other better,” he said.",

    "source": "Iran Grants Bail to Woman From Britain Held 5 Months <eos> TEHRAN — A British-Iranian woman detained in Iran since June, whose case attracted international attention after her family said she had been arrested after trying to attend an all-male volleyball match, was released on bail on Sunday. The British Foreign Office confirmed the release of the woman, Ghoncheh Ghavami, but said the Iranian authorities would not allow her to return to Britain. Ms. Ghavami, 25, was released after paying bail of about $30,000, her mother, Susan Moshtaghian, told the Iranian Students’ News Agency on Sunday. “Based on the verdict handed down by the court, she was sentenced to one year imprisonment and banned for two years to leave the country,” she said. The family is awaiting a decision by the Court of Appeal. Ms. Ghavami, a London law school graduate, had been in Iran only four months, after spending most of her life in Britain, when she was drawn into the world of Tehran’s small and heavily monitored circle of activists. Two arrests, including one in front of a volleyball stadium, preceded her detention on June 30. Image Ghoncheh Ghavami Credit Press Association, via Associated Press Ms. Moshtaghian insisted that her daughter was innocent. “She has been defending herself and is innocent,” she told the news agency. The charges against Ms. Ghavami have been unclear. Some websites say she has been accused of having contacts with opposition groups, but her former lawyer said she had been found guilty of spreading propaganda against Iran’s political system. The British government and human rights groups like Amnesty International had called for her release. Prosecutors said she had been charged for taking part in opposition protests abroad, not for trying to watch the volleyball match. Ms. Ghavami was arrested a week after she attended a protest against the limits imposed on Iranian women, who are, among other things, barred from attending all-male volleyball matches. Iranian law does not recognize dual citizenship, so all those holding an Iranian passport are regarded as Iranian subjects. There is no British Embassy in Tehran. Another person with dual citizenship, the Iranian-American Jason Rezaian, who is a correspondent for The Washington Post, has been detained since July 22.",

    "source": "Pick Up the Phone, Your Search Term Is Calling <eos> GOOGLE is going 20th century. The company, whose empire is based on its ability to connect people and businesses through computers, is now connecting them the old-fashioned way -- over the phone. Starting late last year, the site began showing green phone icons next to selected advertisements that appear with search results. When the icon is clicked, the user is prompted to enter his or her phone number. The phone will then ring, with the business on the other end of the line (dial-up users would have to disconnect from the Internet first). Google is not charging marketers for the service yet, but analysts say it is a sure bet the company will, thereby ushering in the era of \"pay-per-call\" advertising in earnest. \"Google's entry into this market will popularize this whole space,\" said Greg Sterling, an analyst with Kelsey Group, a marketing consultancy. \"And given the sheer volume of advertisers, this could generate considerable revenue for them.\" The pay-per-call advertising market looks as if it may well evolve just as the pay-per-click market did. Google watched and waited while another company, Overture, demonstrated the viability of the business before releasing its own version of the service. Yahoo then bought Overture in 2003 for $1.6 billion, while Google built its own technology. Likewise, the pay-per-call market has largely been developed by a company called Ingenio, which is based in San Francisco, and has been offering advertisers the service since 2004. Google appears to be building its system (with the help of VoIP Inc., a Florida-based company), while Yahoo is testing a version of the service with Ingenio. Just as in pay-per-click advertising, pay-per-call marketers bid for the right to have their ads appear near the top results of search queries, and pay only when someone actually uses them. Consumers either choose the click-to-call option or simply dial the number in the ad. In either case, the number is a dedicated line that middleman companies like Ingenio or eStara, a company based in Reston, Va., have procured for each advertiser. Those companies connect and log the call, charge the advertisers and share the money with the site on which the ad appeared. Mr. Sterling predicted that there would be an eager market for pay-per-call services among small service-oriented businesses. About 70 percent of those businesses do not have Web sites, so pay-per-click advertising makes no sense for them. But even those who do have sites often lack the sophistication or the time to manage a pay-per-click campaign, which can require considerable tweaking to outbid competitors without spending too much. Pay-per-call advertisers must still manage campaigns, but the approach appears so effective that for many it is worth the effort. Judson Brady, the owner of Broad Street Flowers, an Atlanta-based floral service, said he paid Yahoo about $1.25 for each prospect who clicked on his search page advertisement, and 5 percent of those prospects ordered. By contrast, Mr. Brady said he paid Ingenio around $4.15 for each call from a prospect -- most of whom see the ads on AOL, which introduced its pay-per-call service last year. More than a third of the callers place an order. \"We're lucky to break even on the pay-per-clicks, but with pay-per-call we'll make $25 profit per order,\" he said. \"My only complaint is there's not more of it.\" Google would not comment on its pay-per-call test, much less confirm that it is considering a pay-per-call service. Yahoo likewise would not comment on its pay-per-call test. Marc Barach, Ingenio's chief marketing officer, said the company had signed up fewer than 10,000 advertisers in about 750 of the 1,300 business categories it had carved out in a Yellow Pages-type taxonomy. Advertisers have bid up the average price for a call by 50 cents a month since the company started, he said, with the average now at about $10. Advertisers and prospects typically talk for five minutes, Mr. Barach said, \"so we know lengthy conversations are taking place.\" In addition to AOL and, to a much more limited degree, Yahoo, Ingenio's pay-per-call advertisers appear on search results from Infospace's search sites, including DogPile, and on the pages of Web publishers like Depot.com, which uses search technology from Miva, based in Fort Myers, Fla. Verizon's Superpages.com, a Yellow Pages site, also features a pay-per-call system that it built in conjunction with eStara. Robyn Rose, vice president of Internet marketing for Superpages, would not say how many advertisers had signed up for the service. \"But we're one of the largest, if not the largest,\" she said. Superpages.com markets the service through its 3,000 advertising representatives, who call on the company's 1.1 million customers. Those representatives help clients create the ads and aim them toward a particular geographical area in exchange for a $20 monthly fee. Then the advertisers bid for the right to have the ads appear highest when Superpages.com visitors conduct a search. MSN visitors will also see those ads, because the company relies on Verizon to place ads on its local search service. While the big search sites and pay-per-call technology companies are eager to see this market build, some advertisers are sad to see the secret start to get out, said William Leake, chief executive of Leads, Customers, Growth, a marketing consultancy based in Austin, Tex. Mr. Leake said one of his clients, a health care company that spends $70 million annually in direct marketing, had been buying pay-per-call ads since last year, but asked him not to disclose their name. \"They've been Hoovering up leads and they don't want competitors to start piling in and bidding up the prices,\" Mr. Leake said. Advertisers who entered the pay-per-click fray early on were able to glean fairly inexpensive leads. Now that many businesses have begun buying clicks, though, there are fewer bargains to be found. \"The pay-per-call medium opens a new front that allows some small businesses to jump in there and make hay before the crazy elephants jump in and open their checkbooks,\" Mr. Leake said. \"So at least for a limited period of time, they can play the game.\"",

    "source": "Investors, Hungry for Hope, Send Dow Up 410 <eos> A seesaw day on Wall Street ended with a rush of euphoria Thursday as investors raced back into beaten-down banking shares, heartened by signs that the government is taking more drastic steps to tamp down problems plaguing the financial markets. In a rally that came in the final hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrials surged to a 410-point gain, nearly erasing the 449-point loss sustained on Wednesday. But it was by no means a sign that the crisis on Wall Street had turned a corner. Fear and stress still abounded in the credit markets, where investors flocked to the safety of Treasury bills and banks charged each other higher loan rates, a reflection of lingering anxiety about the health of the financial industry. As investors grapple with the once-unthinkable developments that have rocked the world of finance in the last week, lending to consumers and some businesses has tightened, drying up an important lubricant of the economy even as growth continues to contract. “We are still in a flight-to-quality mode,” said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management, a bond investment firm in Burlington , Vt. “When I assess the mood on my trading desk, people are still very concerned that we have not seen the end of this crisis.” The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closed up 4.33 percent, to 1,206.51, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.86 percent, to 11,019.69 The Nasdaq composite jumped 4.78 percent. Analysts attributed the stock market rally not to a fundamental improvement in the financial environment, but rather to reports that the government might be planning to quarantine some of the worst assets held by major banks. Sentiment was also buoyed when regulators announced actions intended to blunt the impact of short sellers, investors who bet that a stock’s price will drop. Some banks and government officials have blamed short sellers for the precipitous drops in shares of big banks over the last few months, including the decline that played a role in the downfall of Lehman Brothers this week. Shares of the last two independent investment banks standing, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs , seesawed a day after suffering steep losses. Investors worried that the banks could face fates similar to those of Lehman and Merrill Lynch , which sold itself Sunday to Bank of America to avert a deepening financial crisis. Morgan Stanley stock ended up 3.7 percent, but Goldman Sachs closed down, one of the few major financial companies to end the day in the red. Goldman shares lost 5.7 percent; earlier they were down as much as 25 percent, reflecting the uncertainty over the bank’s future. Wachovia , the banking giant that is considering a possible merger with Morgan Stanley, jumped nearly 60 percent; Washington Mutual , the troubled savings and loan that has also been working on efforts to save itself, gained 49 percent. For the first time since Lehman collapsed and the American International Group was rescued, President Bush made a brief statement in Washington , saying the government would “act to strengthen and stabilize our financial markets and improve investor confidence.” Earlier, the Federal Reserve said it would extend an effort that allows central banks around the world to lend dollars in foreign economies. The Fed will provide an extra $180 billion under the program to grease the wheels of finance. Despite the surge in stocks, investors remained wary about lending to businesses and to one another. The cost to insure companies’ debt, a measure of investors’ confidence in the firms, remained at historically high levels, analysts said, although the cost declined slightly from Wednesday. Investors displayed a strong preference for safer and more tradable government securities than other short-term, private debt. The cost of several types of corporate and bank borrowing remained high and, in some cases, increased further. A gauge of fear — the Libor rate, which measures how much banks charge one another for overnight loans — remained elevated on Thursday. Treasury notes and bonds sold off in the afternoon but the price of short-term government debt remained elevated. The yield on the three-month Treasury bill, which falls when the price rises, was 0.076 percent, little changed from 0.061 percent on Wednesday. A week ago, the yield was 1.644 percent. The sharp move in the last few days suggests that some investors are willing to receive virtually no return to hold a Treasury bill, thought to be among the safest of all investments. By contrast, interest rates on three-month commercial paper, a competing form of private borrowing used by banks and corporations, jumped to 3.32 percent, from 3.17 percent on Wednesday and 2.86 percent a week earlier, according to Bloomberg data. If the tight conditions in the money market persist, economists and analysts say it could severely limit the availability of credit to businesses and consumers. Federal Reserve data released on Thursday showed that consumer and business borrowing slowed significantly, though it continued to grow, in the second quarter. Commercial paper outstanding fell by 2.87 percent for the seven days that ended Wednesday, according to the Federal Reserve, its biggest one-week decline since the summer of 2007. Back then, investors became concerned about certain kinds of commercial paper that was used to buy securities backed by mortgages and other consumer debts. “This is a breakdown in the system of trading bonds and a breakdown of extending credit,” said James T. Swanson, chief investment officer at MFS Investments, a mutual fund company based in Boston . Mr. Swanson said that so far, the stress had not affected most nonfinancial corporations, many of which have large holdings of cash and do not have a pressing need to borrow money. But he said companies that his analysts talk to have said the credit squeeze could start to hurt if the commercial paper market remains shut down and bank lending remains as tight as it is now. Sectors like energy, pharmaceuticals and technology are more flush with cash and less vulnerable to troubles in the credit markets. But others, like retail stores, restaurants and airlines, could be hurt if tight conditions persist. Kurt von Emster, portfolio manager of the MPM BioEquities Fund, said he had advised companies to draw down on their bridge loans from banks, because of the turmoil in the credit market. “Those will be not only hard to come by, but impossible to come by,” he said about bridge loans. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 1 3/32, at 103 25/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.54 percent, up from 3.41 percent late Wednesday. Following are the results of Thursday’s Treasury auction of 20-day and 76-day cash management bills:",

    "source": "Texas and Washington Clash Over Air Pollution Permits <eos> HOUSTON — For 16 years, a showdown has been brewing between Texas and federal environmental officials over the state’s unique way of regulating industrial air pollution, which many critics complain is lax and has led to some of the dirtiest air in the country. Now, President Obama’s new regional director of the Environmental Protection Agency in Dallas has forced the issue. The new environmental sheriff is Al Armendariz, a 40-year-old chemical engineer from El Paso, and two weeks ago, he took the unprecedented step of barring Texas from issuing an operating permit to a refinery in Corpus Christi. The state’s rules for granting permits have long violated the Clean Air Act , Mr. Armendariz said, and he made it clear that the agency would do the same thing in about 39 other cases, among them several major refineries, unless Texas changed its system. “The State of Texas has to let me know if they can issue permits that are consistent with federal requirements, and if they can’t, then we will,” he said. Since Mr. Armendariz’s announcement, a political donnybrook as broken out. Gov. Rick Perry , who has been in attack mode against all things Washington, warned that jobs would be lost. At a warehouse in Deer Park, just a few blocks from the string of refineries along the Houston shipping canal, a line of blue-collar workers recently stood stiffly behind Mr. Perry, a Republican seeking his third full term, as he accused federal environmental regulators of persecuting Texas. The governor suggested that the Obama administration must have political motives for cracking down on the state. “Washington just isn’t happy unless they have total control of everything,” he said, playing a note that pleases his conservative constituents. “This administration seems to think it’s their way or the highway.” But, the Democratic nominee for governor, the former mayor of Houston, Bill White, has accused Mr. Perry of mismanaging the state environmental agency and of losing control of a vital authority. Environmentalists have also fired at the governor, charging that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has become a toothless lapdog of the industry it regulates. But beyond the finger-pointing and partisan posturing is a dispute between Texas and Washington over air quality that stretches back through the Bush and Clinton administrations. At issue is the state’s practice of “flexible permitting.” The Clean Air Act requires polluters to limit emissions for several key pollutants from each smokestack, or other source inside a plant or refinery. But since 1994, Texas has instead given about 140 plants — among them the largest refineries in the state — a general ceiling for pollution from all sources inside a plant. Mr. Armendariz, in an interview, said the scheme made it extremely difficult for federal regulators to figure out if a plant was polluting or not. If they find one source of pollution at a refinery, for instance, they must balance it against hundreds of others. “It’s an impossible situation,” he said. “These permits are unenforceable.” The system has other advantages for industrial polluters, he said. Many have managed to expand their plants without including the controls required on new sources of pollution by getting the state to raise the cap for the whole complex. There is also hard evidence that these plants produce more toxins for each barrel of oil or chemicals they process than similar refineries and factories in other states, he said. Other critics say a flexible permit means a single stack can be spewing a toxic chemical at illegal levels as long as the overall pollution cap is met. And if that source is close to the edge of a refinery, for instance, it can have devastating effects on people living nearby. Some environmentalists also argue that the overall pollutions limits in the permits are too high, making it easy for the industry to meet them and giving polluters room to exceed limits for certain pollutants on certain days without facing the consequences. “They never exceed the limits,” said Jen Powis, a lawyer with the Lonestar chapter of The Sierra Club. “The T.C.E.Q. really gave them this inflated bubble for the entire site.” No other state uses this system, which is beloved by many business leaders here, and the E.P.A. under three presidents has refused to sanction it. Even President George W. Bush’s regional administrator, who was not known for being tough on the oil industry, challenged the permitting program in 2002, on similar grounds as Mr. Armendariz. State officials, however, point out that under their regimen, Texas has seen steep drops in air pollution, larger than the national average. Ozone levels have dropped 22 percent since 2000, and nitrogen oxide levels are down 46 percent, they say. “The proof is in the pudding,” said Mark R. Vickery, the executive director of the environmental quality commission. “The air has gotten tremendously cleaner.” No one disputes that the situation has improved in recent years, but environmentalists say the gains have come in spite of the state’s loose regulation of industry, not as a result of state pressure. They say lawsuits brought by the federal government and environmental groups account for most of the gains, along with the national trend toward cleaner fuels and more energy-efficient cars. Besides, these critics argue, Texas started out with such high levels of pollution in the 1990s that it was not difficult to cut emissions significantly. “Better does not equal good,” said Matthew Tejada, the executive director of Air Alliance Houston, an environmental group. “We still do not have clean air in Texas.” Elena M. Marks, a former director of health and environmental policy for the City of Houston, said the national emissions figures showed that the amount of carcinogens released into the air for each barrel of oil processed in Houston’s refineries was higher than the average at refineries in other states, even within the same company. Ms. Marks, who now works for Mr. White’s campaign, said Houston became so disenchanted with the state’s monitoring that it bought its own mobile laboratory to test for pollutants. Simply by publicizing the illegal levels of emissions it found, the city shamed oil and chemical companies into halving benzene and butadiene emissions over the last six years, she said. Houston was not the only entity upset with the current system. Saying they needed more regulatory certainty, the Texas Oil and Gas Association sued the E.P.A. in 2008 in an effort to force the Bush administration to make a final decision on the flexible permits. Now, however, Mr. Armendariz has made it clear he intends to force the state’s hand this summer. “The time for delay and for partnership and for compromise is very quickly coming to an end,” he said, “and we have to get the Clean Air Act implemented in the State of Texas.”",

    "source": "U.S. Sergeant Kills 16 Afghan Civilians, 9 of Them Children <eos> PANJWAI, Afghanistan — Stalking from home to home, a United States Army sergeant methodically killed at least 16 civilians, 9 of them children, in a rural stretch of southern Afghanistan early on Sunday, igniting fears of a new wave of anti-American hostility, Afghan and American officials said. Residents of three villages in the Panjwai district of Kandahar Province described a terrifying string of attacks in which the soldier, who had walked more than a mile from his base, tried door after door, eventually breaking in to kill within three separate houses. The man gathered 11 bodies, including those of 4 girls younger than 6, and set fire to them, villagers said. Coming after a period of deepening public outrage, spurred by the Koran burning by American personnel last month and an earlier video showing American Marines urinating on dead militants, the possibility of a violent reaction to the killings added to a feeling of siege here among Western personnel. Officials described growing concern over a cascade of missteps and offenses that has cast doubt on the ability of NATO personnel to carry out their mission and has left troops and trainers increasingly vulnerable to violence by Afghans seeking revenge. President Hamid Karzai condemned the attacks, calling them in a statement an “inhuman and intentional act” and demanding justice. Both President Obama and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta called Mr. Karzai, expressing condolences and promising thorough investigations. “This incident is tragic and shocking, and does not represent the exceptional character of our military and the respect that the United States has for the people of Afghanistan,” Mr. Obama said in a statement. American officials in Kabul were scrambling to understand what had happened, and appealed for calm, at a moment when the United States and Afghanistan are in tense negotiations on the terms of the long-term American presence in the country. The officials said the suspect was an Army staff sergeant who acted alone and then surrendered. “The initial reporting that we have at this time indicates there was one shooter, and we have one man in custody,” said Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, a NATO spokesman. A senior American military official said Sunday evening that the sergeant was attached to a unit based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, a major Army and Air Force installation near Tacoma , Wash., and that he had been part of what is called a village stabilization operation in Afghanistan. In those operations, teams of Green Berets, supported by other soldiers, try to develop close ties with village elders, organize local police units and track down Taliban leaders. The official said the sergeant was not a Green Beret himself. Another senior military official said the sergeant was 38 and married with two children. He had served three tours of duty in Iraq , this official said, and had been deployed to Afghanistan for the first time in December. Yet another military official said he has served in the Army for 11 years. In Panjwai, a reporter for The New York Times who inspected bodies that had been taken to the nearby American military base counted 16 dead, including five children with single gunshot wounds to the head, and saw burns on some of the children’s legs and heads. “All the family members were killed, the dead put in a room, and blankets were put over the corpses and they were burned,” said Anar Gula, an elderly neighbor who rushed to the house after the soldier had left. “We put out the fire.” The villagers also brought some of the burned blankets on motorbikes to display at the base, Camp Belambay, in Kandahar, and show that the bodies had been set alight. Soon, more than 300 people had gathered outside to protest. At least five Afghans were wounded in the attacks, officials said, some of them seriously, indicating the death toll could rise. NATO said several casualties were being treated at a military hospital. One of the survivors from the attacks, Abdul Hadi, 40, said he was at home when a soldier broke down the door. “My father went out to find out what was happening, and he was killed,” he said. “I was trying to go out and find out about the shooting, but someone told me not to move, and I was covered by the women in my family in my room, so that is why I survived.” Mr. Hadi said there was more than one soldier involved in the attacks, and at least five other villagers described seeing a number of soldiers, and also a helicopter and flares at the scene. But that claim was unconfirmed — other Afghan residents described seeing only one gunman — and it was unclear whether extra troops had been sent out to the village after the attack to catch the gunman. In a measure of the mounting mistrust between Afghans and the coalition, however, many Afghans, including lawmakers and other officials, said they believed the attacks had been planned, and were incredulous that one American soldier could have carried out such attacks without help. In his statement, Mr. Karzai said “American forces” had entered the houses in Panjwai, but at another point he said the killings were the act of an individual soldier. Others called for calm. Abdul Hadi Arghandihwal, the minister of economy and the leader of Hezb-e-Islami, a major Afghan political party with Islamist leanings, said there would probably be new protests. But he said the killings should be seen as the act of an individual and not of the United States. “It is not the decision of the Army officer to order somebody to do something like this,” he said. “Probably there are going to be many demonstrations, but it will not change the decisions of our government about our relationship with the United States.” Elsewhere, news of the killings was spreading only slowly. Other than the protest at the base in Kandahar, there were no immediate signs of the fury that fueled rioting across the country after the burning of Korans by American military personnel in February. Both the United States Embassy in Kabul, which immediately urged caution among Americans traveling or living in Afghanistan, and the military coalition rushed to head off any further outrage, deploring the attacks, offering condolences for the families and promising the soldier would be brought to justice. Brig. Gen. Carsten Jacobson, the NATO spokesman, expressed his “deep sadness” and said that while the motive was not yet clear, it looked like an isolated episode. “I am not linking this to the recent incidents over the recent days and weeks,” he said. “It looks very much like an individual act. We have to look into the background behind it.” Adding to the sense of concern, the killings occurred two days after an episode in Kapisa Province, in eastern Afghanistan, in which NATO helicopters apparently hunting Taliban insurgents instead fired on civilians, killing four and wounding three others, Afghan officials said. About 1,200 demonstrators marched in protest in Kapisa on Saturday. The rapid arrest on Sunday could help prevent a repeat of last month’s unrest. The reaction to the Koran-burning case revealed a huge cultural gap between the Americans, who saw it as an unfortunate mistake, and the Afghans, who viewed it as a crime and wanted to see those responsible tried as criminals. The Afghans and Americans agreed on the severity of the killings on Sunday, though, and General Jacobson said the case would be aggressively pursued by American legal authorities. It was less clear how the attacks would affect the talks between Kabul and Washington , known as strategic partnership talks, which will define the American presence and role in the country after the withdrawal of combat troops. The upheaval prompted by the Koran burnings led to a near-breakdown in those talks, but they appeared tentatively back on track after a deal struck Friday for the Afghans to assume control of the main coalition prison in six months. The strategic partnership talks must still address differences over the American campaign of night raids on Afghan houses. The attack on Sunday may complicate that issue, because it bore some similarities to the night raids carried out by coalition forces in Afghanistan. The shootings also carried some echoes of an attack in March 2007 in eastern Afghanistan, when several Marines opened fire with automatic weapons, killing as many as 19 civilians after a suicide car bomb struck the Marines’ convoy, wounding one Marine. Panjwai, a rural district near the city of Kandahar, was traditionally a Taliban stronghold. It was a focus of the United States military offensive in 2010 and was the scene of heavy fighting. Two American soldiers were killed by small-arms fire in Panjwai on March 1, and three died in a roadside bomb attack in February.",

    "source": "Obama Univision Interview Shows Power of Spanish Media <eos> As part of the Democratic get-out-the-vote campaign, President Obama gave an interview to a Spanish-language radio show that was broadcast last Monday — and just for good measure, his wife, Michelle, followed up a few days later. The Obamas’ twin appearances on “Piolín por la Mañana,” heard across the country on Univision Radio, are a testament to the ballooning political power of the Spanish language news media, and in particular to the power of Univision, which owns the biggest Spanish-language television and radio outlets in the United States. Univision says it does not favor any political party. Regardless, analysts say that the company is exerting significant influence both on local elections and on the national debate about immigration — in part by encouraging Hispanics to cast a ballot. In commercials and on its Web site, Univision tells its audience, “Vota, es tu derecho,” or “Vote, it is your right.” Some of the commercials also promote a voter information phone line. Conversely, last month the network rejected an advertisement that urged Hispanics not to vote in the midterm elections. César Conde, president of Univision Networks, said Spanish-language outlets had been focusing on the importance of voting because they had a responsibility to “make sure that our community in the U.S. maximizes its potential.” Federico Subervi, a communications professor at Texas State University and the author of “The Mass Media and Latino Politics,” said that Univision bulked up its election coverage in 2008 — that year, it sponsored two presidential primary debates — and again in 2010. Univision’s chief (but much smaller) competitor, Telemundo, has done the same, with a get-out-the-vote campaign this year called “Tu Voto, Tu Futuro,” or “Your Vote, Your Future.” Underscoring just how seriously it is taking the elections, Univision’s coverage is titled “Destino 2010,” or “Destiny 2010.” On Tuesday, it will run news updates every half-hour starting at 1 p.m. Eastern time, when polls are still open across the country. English-language networks generally do not start election news updates until 8 p.m. Because there are relatively few Spanish-language outlets in the United States, Univision wields a more influential megaphone than its English-language counterparts. Merely by spending more time on its newscasts on campaign issues like immigration that are especially meaningful to its audience, Univision affects the debate on those issues, Mr. Subervi said. Univision has heavily promoted itself as being, as it once said in a news release, on the “forefront of the national debate” about reform, particularly after Arizona passed a stringent new law to police immigrants. In May, the network devoted half a day to live protest coverage, held a prime time debate about the law and brought its Sunday public affairs program “Al Punto” to Phoenix. On Univision, reporters never refer to “illegal aliens,” opting instead for “undocumented immigrants.” It is a matter of sensitivity, news executives say. “We pride ourselves on presenting all points of view on immigration,” said Alina Falcon, the president of Univision News. “That said, we do look out for the interests of our community. We do provide a platform for the exposition of unique problems for our community.” When Mr. Obama came on Univision Radio, the host Eddie Sotelo pretended to let him pick the first topic. The options he said, were “A, immigration reform; B, immigration reform; C, immigration reform; or D, all of the above.” The president chose D, and proceeded to say that Republicans were unwilling to “step up” and help pass a comprehensive reform bill. Mr. Obama called on the Univision listeners to vote, and in the process, gave some fodder to critics. “If Latinos sit out the election instead of saying, ‘We’re going to punish our enemies and we’re going to reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us,’ if they don’t see that kind of upsurge in voting in this election, then I think it’s going to be harder” to pass immigration reform, he said. Conservatives like Representative John A. Boehner, the House Republican leader who hopes to be the next speaker, pounced on the “punish our enemies” line, and on Monday Mr. Obama said in an English-language radio interview that “I probably should have used the word ‘opponents’ instead of ‘enemies.’ ” Immigration is just one part of Univision’s news diet, and lately the network has been noticed for its campaign coverage. It has hosted the chairmen of both political parties on its Sunday morning public affairs program and sponsored news-making debates in the governors’ races in Florida and California. Mr. Conde said a growing number of candidates had come to recognize that the Hispanic electorate “is becoming a swing vote.” Democrats of all stripes have granted Univision’s interview requests, but so too have many Republicans, including Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona and Carly Fiorina, the California Senate candidate. Mr. Subervi noted that Univision had given extensive coverage to a wave of campaign ads casting immigrants in a negative light. One ad, by the Republican Senate candidate in Nevada, Sharron Angle, showed men who appear to be Hispanic carrying guns, huddling against a wall and posing for mug shots. He said ads like Ms. Angle’s are “gaining the attention of Univision, Telemundo and other media, and infuriating Latinos enough to vote against that person.”",

    "source": "Records Seized in Illinois Town Accused of Water Irregularity <eos> CRESTWOOD, Ill. —Federal agents and the Illinois state police raided Village Hall here Wednesday morning, seizing Crestwood’s drinking water records in a search for evidence of environmental crimes, officials said. The raid was prompted by recent accusations that for 21 years Crestwood officials supplemented the village’s water supply, which comes from Lake Michigan, with water from a local well despite a warning in 1986 from state environmental officials that doing so was dangerous and illegal. “The village cooperated with the search, and they are going ahead with city business as usual,” a spokeswoman for the federal Environmental Protection Agency, Anne Rowan, said. The raid was the latest jolt to this working-class village of 11,000 residents since the accusations were first reported by The Chicago Tribune last week. A spokeswoman for the State Environmental Protection Agency said last week that agency officials had cited the village for violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act and knowingly providing false information about the source of the village’s water. The spokeswoman, Maggie Carson, also said that the village’s drinking water was safe, and that despite the elevated levels of some potentially harmful chemicals the public’s health had never been at risk. Ms. Carson said that in 1986 “we did a spot check and had some concerns about the samples” of water from the well. “We asked them to stop using it as a drinking water source,” she said. Over the years, Crestwood officials reported that only water from Lake Michigan was feeding the local supply, Ms. Carson said. But in 2007, she said, another inspection found that 10 percent to 20 percent of the local water still came from the well. In a letter to residents and business owners, Mayor Robert Stranczek said that the well had not been used since it was shut off in September 2007 and that the safety of Crestwood’s drinking water was never compromised. “I can tell you the leaders of this community, including my father who served for four decades as mayor, have always put the safety and security of our residents first,” Mr. Stranczek said in the letter. Not everyone was reassured. A lawsuit against the village has been filed on behalf of residents who contend their health was jeopardized by the well water. On Saturday night, a public meeting attracted an emotional crowd of 200, many of whom questioned whether illnesses like cancer could be linked to the village’s drinking water. Still, some residents say that the uproar is misguided and that there is no scientific evidence linking the well water to health problems. “We’ve lived in Crestwood for 38 years, and we trust that our mayor would not have us drinking water if it was harmful,” said Val Canavan, 67, a retired teacher. “Our family — my husband and I, three children, and 10 grandchildren — are very healthy,” Ms. Canavan added. But another longtime resident, Yolanda Szymusiak, 54, said she now boiled tap water before adding it to the coffee maker, has stocked up on bottled water and shopped for filters for her faucets. “I can’t believe they would try to save some money by slowly poisoning us,” Ms. Szymusiak said. “In Crestwood,” she said, “we get a rebate back every year after we pay the second installment of our property taxes. But I’d rather not get any money back and drink good water.” State environmental agency officials say they planned to review current public notification and information laws to see whether any provisions needed tightening, but some residents said that if Crestwood’s water supply was contaminated, the heightened vigilance had arrived too late. “You always hear that water is the best thing for you,” said Mike Toscas, 22, a college student. “But for people living in Crestwood, it has turned out to be the worst thing. I would have been better off drinking pop all these years.”",

After entering the DPRK as a member of tourists’ group in October he perpetrated acts of infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and slandering its socialist system, quite contrary to the purpose of tour. He also committed such crime as trying to look for spies and terrorists who conducted espionage and subversive activities against the DPRK in the area of Mt. Kuwol during the last Fatherland Liberation War as well as their families and descendants and connect them with the “Kuwol Partisan Comrades-in-Arms Association,” an anti-DPRK plot-breeding organization of south Korea. According to the results of the investigation, he was active as adviser of “Kuwol Unit” of the UN Korea 6th Partisan Regiment part of the Intelligence Bureau of the Command of the U.S. Forces in the Far East since early in 1953. He is a criminal as he masterminded espionage and subversive activities against the DPRK and in this course he was involved in killings of service personnel of the Korean People’s Army and innocent civilians. The investigation clearly proved Newman’s hostile acts against the DPRK and they were backed by evidence. He admitted all his crimes and made an apology for them.",

The embattled company’s shareholders, meanwhile, approved its takeover by Bank of America . The civil lawsuits, which also name Countrywide’s chief executive, Angelo R. Mozilo, as a defendant, accuse the lender of engaging in unfair trade practices that encouraged homeowners to take out risky loans, regardless of whether they could repay them. The lender, based in Calabasas, Calif., became the company most closely associated with the American housing boom, in which mortgages with low teaser rates were seemingly handed out to anyone who asked, as well as the real estate market’s subsequent collapse when mortgage rates rose and shaky borrowers lost their homes to foreclosure. “Countrywide exploited the American dream of homeownership and then sold its mortgages for huge profits on the secondary market,” California’s attorney general, Jerry Brown, said in a statement. The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. It also names the company president, David Sambol, as a defendant. A Countrywide representative was not available to comment. Countrywide shareholders voted in a meeting Wednesday to approve the lender’s takeover by Bank of America, a deal spurred by the company’s mortgage market woes. The stock deal, first announced in January and now valued at about $2.8 billion, is expected to close by July 1. Holders of more than 69 percent of eligible Countrywide shares voted in favor of the deal, Countrywide said.",

    "source": "N.H.L. Moves to Lessen Shootouts’ Importance <eos> The N.H.L. has taken a step away from the importance of shootouts by changing a rule that governs tie breakers in the standings. The Board of Governors approved a revision that would use a team’s total number of victories in regulation and overtime — but exclude shootout wins — to break ties among teams with the same number of points at the conclusion of a season, the league announced Tuesday evening. Teams will continue to get two points in the standings for shootout victories. The N.H.L. had accorded shootout wins equal status with regulation and overtime victories since the league instituted shootouts in the 2005-6 season. But the shootout has been derided as a gimmick by commentators and some coaches, including the Rangers ’ John Tortorella. There is evidence that teams are playing for a regulation tie to get that guaranteed point, leading to more shootouts. The number of shootouts has risen consistently, from 145 in 2005-6 to 184 last season. “When we put the shootout in, we never envisioned the unreasonable, disproportionate percentage of games that would be decided in a shootout,” said Brian Burke, the Maple Leafs’ general manager, who has called the shootout a wart in the rules. If the new tie-breaking rule had been in place in 2008-9, the Florida Panthers would have made the playoffs instead of the Montreal Canadiens. Both teams finished eighth in the Eastern Conference, with 93 points and 41 victories. Montreal received the final berth by having the better head-to-head record. But seven of the Canadiens’ wins came in shootouts, as opposed to only three for the Panthers. RANGERS RE-SIGN STAAL The Rangers have re-signed Marc Staal, their top defenseman, to a five-year, $19.875 million contract. Staal, 23, played 82 games last season, registering a career-high eight goals and 19 assists, a plus-11 mark, and only 44 penalty minutes. Staal was due to become a restricted free agent at the end of the 2010-11 season.",

    "source": "Candidate Jerry Patterson Kicks a Spur Into Texas Politics <eos> AUSTIN, Tex. — Jerry Patterson is an authentic Texas politician, at a time when Texas politicians rarely act like Texas politicians. State elected officials and those trying to unseat them sue and countersue, carefully watch what they say, and are quick to apologize when they fail to do so. And then there is Mr. Patterson, the state land commissioner and a former Marine fighter pilot who is quick-witted, loose-lipped and an opponent of anything resembling political correctness. He has tackled issues and made comments over the years that have riled his political opponents — he upset environmentalists by referring to the plan to add the dunes sagebrush lizard to the endangered species list as “reptile dysfunction” — as well as his fellow Republicans, including those in Gov. Rick Perry’s office. In 2009, Mr. Patterson got into a dispute with a Republican state lawmaker, Representative Wayne Christian , after Hurricane Ike destroyed Mr. Christian’s beachfront home on the Bolivar Peninsula near Galveston a year earlier. So that he and his neighbors could rebuild their houses, Mr. Christian pushed to have the properties exempted from a state law that prohibits building at the water’s edge on a public beach. Mr. Patterson told The Houston Chronicle that the Legislature would have to impeach him if it wanted such an exemption enforced, and he had no qualms about being quoted in one of the biggest newspapers in Texas using a PG-rated expletive in reference to Mr. Christian. After nine years as land commissioner, Mr. Patterson, 65, is running in the 2014 election for lieutenant governor, a job many consider the most influential in Austin because of its control over the Senate’s agenda. He is regarded as the underdog — prominent Republicans have expressed interest or declared themselves candidates, including Susan Combs, the state comptroller, and Todd Staples, the agriculture commissioner — but in many ways, Mr. Patterson has become the underdog of the Texas political culture as a whole. He once broke a hand doing a cartwheel at the office. He issued a joke news release as land commissioner challenging his counterpart in New Mexico to a duel to settle a century-old land dispute between the states. (“I think I’ll just wing him,” Mr. Patterson said in the announcement.) He hates being driven around by staff members. (“We tried to stick a travel aide on him at first, just to keep up with him, and he would constantly ditch the guy,” said Jim Suydam, a spokesman.) And he advises newly elected legislators to stroll the Capitol. “You need to go over to the Capitol and look at all those pictures on the wall,” he said. “All those people were elected and thought they were somebody, and you can walk through here and nobody knows who the hell they are. We’re all just passing through.” At a campaign fund-raiser at an Austin bar, Mr. Patterson could have pressed the crowd for more cash, but instead he spent a good part of the evening showing off the engine of his 1951 Ford pickup truck and sharing the microphone with the country singer Gary P. Nunn on “You Never Even Called Me by My Name,” a beer in his hand and a .22-caliber, five-shot revolver in his boot. Flipping through the campaign finance reports of high-profile Texas Republicans, one finds $2,871 catering expenses, $15,000 consulting fees and $126 floral bills. Mr. Patterson’s reports include a $5.57 meal at a Texaco station. “I think in an era of kind of polished politicians, Jerry just comes across as completely unplugged,” said Ted Delisi, a Republican strategist who was the national field director for Mr. Perry’s presidential campaign. “He’s really not like anybody else. In a state of blunt talk, Jerry stands out as the bluntest of the blunt.” Though his office a few blocks from the Capitol in Austin is something of a man cave — antique firearms, a mounted mule deer he shot in Hudspeth County — Mr. Patterson is not the macho type. He resembles not the 6-foot-4 Lyndon B. Johnson, but maybe his 5-foot-10 bespectacled lawyer. For years, Mr. Patterson has carried the loaded revolver in a holster in his boot and a loaded .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol at the small of his back. Because he leads an agency with few security concerns — the General Land Office, which manages billions of dollars in state land, investments and mineral rights and is home to historic maps and documents — his reasons for arming himself daily are largely symbolic. As a state senator from the Houston area, Mr. Patterson wrote the law that gave Texans the right to carry concealed handguns. “Am I afraid of a staff uprising?” he asked. “No, not exactly. It’s a liberty that if you don’t exercise it, it becomes quaint. I don’t care if it’s the Second Amendment or the First or the Fifth or whatever, you have to test it. Like the Occupy movement. There’s some folks with a screw loose. But I want them doing that, because they’re testing the limits.” Because few Texas political leaders are as frank as Mr. Patterson, he has earned the respect of politicians from both parties, including Hector Uribe, the former Democratic state senator who ran against him in 2010 and whom Mr. Patterson once joked about shooting. When Mr. Perry was preparing to debate the musician and humorist Kinky Friedman, who ran for governor in 2006 (one of his slogans was “How hard could it be?”), Mr. Patterson went to the governor’s aid, relying on his own quick wit to play the role of Mr. Friedman. Mr. Perry, Mr. Uribe and other Democrats and Republicans have split with Mr. Patterson on at least one issue, however. Last year, he sponsored a push by the Sons of Confederate Veterans for a Texas specialty license plate displaying the group’s name and logo, which features the Confederate battle flag. Mr. Perry, while running for president, said he opposed the proposed plate. The state Department of Motor Vehicles’ governing board voted against the plates. “I think it’s a pretty clear sign he doesn’t either care what Texans think or that he is so ideologically and racially insensitive that he doesn’t have the ability to really govern a diverse state like ours,” said Matt Glazer, executive director of Progress Texas, a group that promotes liberal causes and fought against the license plate. Mr. Patterson, whose great-grandfather served in the Confederate Army, said that the motor vehicle board had run from controversy in the name of political correctness, and that he had sponsored the plate to honor his great-grandfather and Texas history, even though others might find that history offensive. “Our history needs representation sometimes from those who want to make it fit into nice little cubes,” he said. The day the board voted on the Confederate plate, it approved one honoring the Buffalo Soldiers, the black United States Army regiments from the late 1800s. Mr. Patterson sponsored that plate, too.",

    "source": "Church Tithing Slips in Harlem Even as Neighborhood Improves <eos> The tourists started lining up two hours before morning worship service on West 116th Street in Harlem. Most were dressed in everyday clothes, contrasting with the dark suits and prim dresses of the largely African-American congregation in the historic sanctuary of Canaan Baptist Church of Christ. The Rev. Roger Harris, an associate pastor, made his way from the back of the line in his pinstripe suit. “Good to see you, glad you came,” he said, offering grins and handshakes on a recent Sunday. The tourists were herded to the balcony until, as in several churches in Harlem, they packed the seats there. Down below, where the congregation has dwindled over the years, there were plenty of empty seats. The tourists often put offerings in the collection basket. But then they are gone. And so despite the draw, churches like Canaan are struggling. And at the heart of the struggle is a contradiction: As Harlem’s fortunes rise, tithing — the traditional source of the churches’ money — is fading away. Harlem’s historical base of African-Americans has been dwindling. Those who remain have regularly tithed, setting apart 10 percent of their incomes for their church, in times good and bad. But now that has changed, too. “Your tithers are your people who really keep your church going as a whole,” said the Rev. Dr. Charles A. Curtis, the senior pastor at Mount Olivet Baptist Church and the chairman of Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement . “With the drop in population,” he said, “you have less people to tithe.” The Rev. Jesse T. Williams Jr., senior pastor at Convent Avenue Baptist Church , said, “Giving is a form of worship, and an expression of thanking God for what God has given us.” At his church, he said, tithes in recent years were down about 12 percent. Canaan, now with 1,000 members, has lost 500 since 2000, which increased the amount of room available for tourists. Without the tourists, Mr. Harris said, the senior pastor would be “preaching to an empty balcony.” Image Canaan Baptist Church of Christ has lost 500 congregants since 2000, reflecting Harlem’s dwindling black population. Credit Ozier Muhammad/The New York Times And tithes are down 20 percent, though other offerings at Canaan have been stable. It is not clear how much of that money comes from tourists. Some churches have experienced drops in tithing of as much as 50 percent, said Deborah C. Wright, the chief executive of Carver Federal Savings Bank, leading them to seek loans from her bank. “Clearly this is a transitional period,” said Canaan’s senior pastor, the Rev. Thomas D. Johnson Sr., who celebrated his seventh year at the church last month. “I believe that Canaan and all of our strong churches in Harlem are determined not to become extinct. This institution must survive, not only for the congregation, but because of who we represent.” The story of Canaan, and its current struggle, is shared by many of Harlem’s churches. It was founded in 1932 in the spirit of what elders call a country church. Many early congregants were migrants from the South, sharecroppers under Jim Crow, steeped in a worship tradition. As more families came, the church grew. The previous pastor, the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, led the church for almost 40 years, until he retired in 2004; he was an architect of the civil rights movement and an aide to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “He was a fighter,” said Mr. Harris, who has a goal of increasing church membership by at least 50 within the next year. In 1970, Mr. Walker once stood on the trunk of a car near the church and, through a bullhorn, preached a sermon about drug-dealing in the neighborhood. “We’ve been living dangerously for a long time,” he told his curbside congregation of 300, and whoever else was within earshot, “and we’re not afraid to name names.” The black church, he often said, was the primary resource for the black community. “It is where black people have the ultimate decision-making power,” he said in a 1979 newspaper interview. “Black folks will pay church dues before they pay their rent.” Image At Convent Avenue Baptist Church, the senior pastor, the Rev. Jesse T. Williams Jr., recently greeted parishioners. Credit James Estrin/The New York Times Under Mr. Walker, whose black-and-white portrait hangs in Canaan’s lobby, membership swelled to the point where ushers had to put chairs in the halls. The Canaan that Mr. Johnson inherited, however, looks remarkably different. So does the neighborhood. Where African-Americans once made up the bulk of Central Harlem’s population, they are now less than half. Economically, million-dollar homes and trendy restaurants glimmer amid stubborn pockets of blight. Even in churches where membership has been steady, some pastors say, tithes have dipped. In recent years, food pantries have run bare, building problems have festered, and funds that help people make their rent, keep their electricity on or get a MetroCard to get to work dry up. Some community initiatives have been stalled. Church members always dig deep when pastors make pleas from the pulpit. But despite church holdings in real estate amid Harlem’s rising property values, church operations are tied to the faithful. “Everybody is affected one way or another,” said Mr. Williams of Convent Avenue Baptist, located on 145th Street. “People who have been here a long time, members who have owned their homes or brownstones 30, 40 years, have come up quite well. The other end of the spectrum being, we have members in the congregation who have lost their residences, lost their jobs.” More and more, pastors say, church members bring their worries over layoffs and rent increases to them, and to the altar. “The misery index in Harlem is still high,” Mr. Johnson, 56, said. “It’s really something to walk through Harlem,” he continued, “and see people obviously struggling, and literally on the other side of the street see people walking toy dogs, and coming out of condos. We’ve got to bring them together. I think that’s the bridge we have to build.” Last Sunday, Canaan celebrated its 81st anniversary. And as part of his legacy, Mr. Johnson has been rethinking its ministry. He has ushered in a church Web site and started a men’s ministry, a women’s ministry, a young adult ministry and a social policy institute. He also revived the evangelism ministry, which over the summer will, in part, target Harlem’s growing diversity. “A multilingual church in a multicultural community, that’s where we live now. That’s the kind of Canaan that we’re starting to build,” Mr. Johnson said. “Harlem is going to continue to evolve,” he added, “but we need to make sure we preserve the symbols. People aren’t coming to look at the new condo that went up. They come for the Apollo, to walk down 125th Street and get a glimpse of what that looked like back in the day, and the churches where pastors like Walker preached.”",

    "source": "Accounts of Violence Spread in Zimbabwe <eos> JOHANNESBURG — Ten days after Zimbabwe voted and by most accounts rejected its long-serving, autocratic president, Robert Mugabe , the mood of the country grew more ominous on Tuesday. The opposition reported widespread attacks on its supporters, black youths drove white farmers off their land and election officials were accused of vote tampering and arrested. As Mr. Mugabe sought to cling to power beyond his 28th year in office, the High Court began to weigh the demand of the opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change, for the immediate release of the presidential election results. They have still not been announced, but the opposition says they will give it victory. With international pressure building on Mr. Mugabe’s government to tell his nation who won, the police, part of his apparatus of power, arrested five election officials accused of tampering with the vote to the detriment of Mr. Mugabe’s tally, the state-run newspaper The Herald reported Tuesday. The opposition party has pleaded for international intervention to resolve Zimbabwe’s political stalemate, and at a news conference in Harare, Tendai Biti, its secretary general, protested what he called “the deafening silence” from the African Union and a regional bloc of nations known as the Southern African Development Community, The Associated Press reported. “I say to our brothers and sisters across the continent, don’t wait for dead bodies in the streets of Harare,” he said. Officials from human rights groups and trade union alliances said the arrests of election officials appeared to be a tactic to intimidate those counting the votes, while the delay seemed devised to buy ZANU-PF, Mr. Mugabe’s governing party, time to figure out how to survive and perhaps to rig the outcome. “The fear is they’re going to try to force these officials to falsify results in key constituencies where the votes might be enough to swing the national election,” said Patrick Craven, a spokesman for the Congress of South African Trade Unions, which joined with the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions on Tuesday to call for the immediate release of the outcome. Zimbabweans say their rising sense of foreboding grows out of ZANU-PF’s past use of violence for political ends. In 2000, after the defeat of a referendum that would have given Mr. Mugabe greater powers, he blamed white farmers. In the years since, he has sanctioned the seizure of thousands of their farms, often by force. He said he did so to right the injustices of the colonial era, which concentrated farmland in the hands of whites, but much of the confiscated land was doled out as patronage to ZANU-PF’s governing elite. In 2005, Mr. Mugabe’s government demolished the homes of hundreds of thousands of poor people in urban neighborhoods that were strongholds of the political opposition. And last year, the police rounded up dozens of opposition figures, including the current presidential candidate of Movement for Democratic Change, Morgan Tsvangirai , beating and arresting them. The opposition said this persecution was happening again in rural areas where there were no witnesses but the victims. Nelson Chamisa, a spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change, said Tuesday that about 200 of its polling agents, campaign workers and supporters had been arrested, beaten or kidnapped since the election. ZANU-PF is organizing and arming youth militias, he said. “People are facing serious retributive attacks,” he said. The government’s information minister, Sikhanyiso Ndlovu, denied the charges, telling The Associated Press: “They are concocting things. It is peaceful.” Trevor Gifford, president of the Commercial Farmers Union of Zimbabwe, said groups of as many as 200 young men, paid by ZANU-PF and chanting party slogans and shouting anti-white epithets, had invaded 60 farms and driven out their inhabitants. “It’s ethnic cleansing happening,” Mr. Gifford said in a telephone interview. “We can very quickly become extinct. People are losing their homes, businesses, lives. It’s really desperate.” The Herald reported Monday that Mr. Mugabe had called on blacks to hold onto the land and never let the whites reclaim it.",

    "source": "Just in Time, Game Between Barcelona and Manchester City Gets a New Dimension <eos> LONDON — The intensity and joy are back with Barcelona. The intensity and belief are back with Manchester City. And there could be few better ways to welcome back the Champions League than when these two meet in Manchester on Tuesday night. If Barça is back on full throttle, that means Lionel Messi is over his injuries and scoring again at a rate that eclipses the greats. The little Argentine chipped in two goals, exquisite of course, in Barcelona’s 6-0 obliteration of Rayo Vallecano on Saturday. Earlier that evening, City eliminated Chelsea from the F.A. Cup, scoring only twice in a performance so strong that Chelsea was not allowed a shot on goal in the 90 minutes. This, said City captain Vincent Kompany, was vengeance for Chelsea winning at the Etihad Stadium in the league two weeks ago. No it wasn’t, City Coach Manuel Pellegrini said; it was the fact that his team did not want to lose twice in its stadium to the same opponent. The best sound of all at the postgame news conferences was the muted acceptance of Chelsea’s coach, José Mourinho. “Simple,” Mourinho said. “City played much better than us, and when the best team wins, I think football is in peace.” It is at peace when this particular man is not bad-mouthing his fellow managers, as Mourinho did so often when his path crossed Pellegrini’s in Spanish and English soccer. The game has another dimension when Barça’s stars are in good health. Two weeks ago, when Messi was tenderly feeling his way back after months of rest for his tired and torn hamstrings, a coach whose team took full advantage of Barcelona’s wounds last season made a significant observation. “When all your players are fit,” Jupp Heynckes told a Barcelona board member, “you still have more talents than us.” Heynckes retired after his Bayern Munich side cleaned out the Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League last season. His acknowledgment that Bayern finished off a weakened Barcelona came two weeks ago, when he met Barcelona’s vice president, Javier Faus. That is how sportsmen — with some exceptions — talk when the microphones are switched off. Heynckes left Munich in great shape, and Pep Guardiola, the former coach at Barcelona, has added talents to Bayern since replacing him. Meanwhile, not only has Messi needed a prolonged timeout, but the captain Carles Puyol, the dynamic inventor Andrés Iniesta and the galvanic left back Jordi Alba have been nursed through strains and nagging pains. It hasn’t always been appreciated, but Tata Martino, the coach in his first season after coming over from Argentina, has juggled maintaining results at the top while rotating and resting senior players. Some fluency was lost. Critics accused Martino of tampering with Barça’s intrinsic “tika-taka” pass-and-move style by trying to persuade players to mix up their approach, to make long diagonal passes from time to time. The coach had one purpose. He sought to arrive at the business end of the European season with a team fit enough and fresh enough to take on the best in Europe. There might, as people have suggested, be another motive. Martino is Argentine. Messi and another Barcelona player, Javier Mascherano, are also Argentine. There is a World Cup coming, and Argentina wants to be a force in that, just as Spain and Brazil and Germany intend to be. Even if it is done subconsciously, players do hold something back through the long season to be ready to take on the World Cup. If anyone is to blame for that, it is FIFA and the clubs for filling out the now year-round calendar with ever more lucrative tournaments. How thrilling, then, it is to see Messi et al. discard their cautious winter coats and turn on their skills again. With his first goal, an audacious flick of the ball over the head of the on-rushing Vallecano keeper on Saturday, Messi tied Alfredo Di Stéfano’s career mark of 227 goals that he scored between 1953 and 1966. One great Argentine player eclipses the record of another. But Messi wasn’t finished. He was involved in more of the goals, scored by Adriano, Alexis Sánchez and lastly by Neymar, the Brazilian returning from an ankle injury with a stunning run from the halfway line before he finished with his right foot. Messi, though, gave one more exhibition of his predatory art, his insatiable appetite for scoring, his joy. His second goal of Saturday night — a low, precise placement from the edge of the 18-yard box, typical for Messi — took him past Di Stéfano’s career total. There are other records on Messi’s radar. He is now level with Raúl González, and Hugo Sánchez’s mark of 234 is within reach. After that is the Athletic Bilbao legend Telmo Zarra, who scored 251 goals from 1940 to 1955. The difference is that those were career tallies, while Messi, who is 26, has plenty of time to add to his 337 total goals in 436 appearances in a Barça shirt. Moreover, in modern soccer not all players get to play 90 minutes every game. Martino did on Saturday what he has done before — he substituted the greatest player in the world to spare his legs and his energy for Tuesday in Manchester. City awaits him in better heart. The 2-0 victory over Chelsea was achieved without the midfield presence of Fernandinho and the scoring threat of Sergio Agüero. Both are injured, and both make a big difference to City. However, David Silva was impishly creative on Saturday, and Pellegrini outfoxed Mourinho with his use of substitutions. The first goal was a delightfully quick and precise low cross shot from Stevan Jovetic, the Montenegrin who has had few opportunities to show his class in Manchester. The second was worked by Silva and scored by Samir Nasri within minutes of Nasri replacing Jovetic. Pellegrini did not crow. His side was in better shape than it was when it met Chelsea 12 days before. A refreshed Barça will be a different dimension altogether.",

    "source": "The Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space Enshrines the East Village Struggle <eos> FOUR days before the opening of the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space on Avenue C, near 10th Street, Bill DiPaola told the volunteer staff about the suggestion box. Though the group was supposed to make all decisions collectively, on this he acted alone. “I put the suggestion box up thinking everybody’s going to be unhappy about everything,” he said of the visitors he expected at the museum’s opening, which was scheduled for Saturday. With a box, he told the staff members, if anyone became abusive, they could say: “That’s awesome. Could you write it down and put it in the box?” He paused for a response, then continued: “Anything to let them leave here without cursing or spitting.” Sheila Jamison, one of the volunteers, eyed him sideways. “Good luck with that,” she said. The museum, conceived by Mr. DiPaola and Laurie Mittelmann, who has studied squats in Denmark and Spain, is a shrine to the recent radical history of the East Village: the 1988 riots in Tompkins Square Park, the standoffs with the police and developers over community gardens, the formation of squats, the civil disobedience actions waged by bicyclists for more bike-friendly streets. Mr. DiPaola, who declined to give his age, lived through many of those battles; Ms. Mittelmann, 24, was, like most of the volunteers, too young. Around the room were photographs of demonstrations and a rack of zines with titles like Profiles of Provocateurs and Under Attack, along with pamphlets of the United States Constitution ($2 each). Blue wooden police barriers decorated the front desk, and a sticker on the telephone read, “THIS PHONE IS TAPPED.” Entrance to the museum will be free, but people can request paid tours of community gardens and squats. It is a homey place, if people in your home use the words “sustainable” and “community” a lot. But for Mr. DiPaola, who is also the director of Time’s Up! , an environmental activist group, the museum involves a battle of ideas. Much of the history has survived only in people’s memories and photographs, each harboring its own version of the truth. How, he wondered, do you turn that into a museum exhibition with a single story line? “What is history?” he asked the group. “There’s corporate history, and there’s our history. Most history museums are history from the past. This isn’t. There’s people who got beat up by police in the park who are going to walk in here. They lost their gardens. They lost their homes. A lot of people didn’t do too well during gentrification.” Around the table, people drank blueberry herbal tea and ate Newman’s Own Organics cookies. “We really like making tea for the meeting because it’s the most communal way of drinking,” Ms. Mittelmann said, sounding a theme for the evening. Later, when someone proposed asking visitors for a suggested donation of $5, Willa Jones, an urban planning intern, thought this was too high. “Three makes it seem like we’re more for the people,” she said. The Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space is an attempt to put this communal spirit and fractious history on display — a successor, of sorts, to the Tenement Museum , which enshrines an earlier piece of neighborhood history. The location, in the long-unused storefront of C-Squat (also See Squat) , is significant. C-Squat, home to numerous punk-rock bands and impromptu gigs, was the loudest and most notorious of the East Village squats. (In 2002, it was one of 11 illegally occupied apartment buildings that the city sold for $1 to a nonprofit organization , which is still in the process of turning the buildings over to the residents.) During Hurricane Sandy, when the East Village lost power, residents of C-Squat grilled food for the neighborhood and gave it out free. In the museum’s lower level, one exhibit is a bicycle-powered generator, which was used to generate electricity during Occupy Wall Street demonstrations in Zuccotti Park. When the power went out after the storm, volunteers put the exhibit on the sidewalk as a neighborhood charging station for cellphones. The history chronicled here, to the extent it has reached the public record, has become mainly one of victories for the activists, visible in the community gardens that adorn every other block in the neighborhood and the squats that are now comfortable residences. But lost are the numerous setbacks and defeats along the way, Mr. DiPaola said — the gardens that were bulldozed for development, the squats whose residents were evicted, the bicycle demonstrations that ended only in mass arrests, not in bicycle lanes. As opening day approached, Mr. DiPaola fretted over tone. He asked that the word “protest” be removed from photo displays. “Protest is a little negative,” he said. “This is a celebration.” At a photograph of El Jardin de la Esperanza on East Seventh Street, where the police forcibly removed protesters and brought in bulldozers in 2000, Mr. DiPaola objected to wording that suggested that a subsequent lawsuit by the state attorney general halted destruction of other gardens. “If you talk to people, they say Eliot Spitzer saved the gardens,” Mr. DiPaola said. “Really, it was the demonstrators who went to court and got a temporary restraining order that saved the gardens. So direct action saves the day, and Spitzer comes in later. “So many of the things I worked on — saving community gardens, getting better infrastructure for bicycling — the history of how it happened seems to get washed out. I have it on film; I was there. So we want to show the true history.” As they do so, though, the museum itself risks becoming history. Start-up costs ran $50,000 to $70,000, much more than expected; rent to C-Squat is $1,681 a month. A campaign to raise $18,500 on the crowd-funding Web site Crowdrise stalled recently at $14,265, and two grant checks for $2,000 were momentarily lost because of problems with mail delivery. “We’re down to our last $200,” Ms. Mittelmann said on Wednesday. They had ideas. Mr. DiPaola said he wanted to sell copies of a T-shirt for a community garden that asked, “What type of worm would you like to have in your neighborhood?” with pictures of an earthworm and a real estate developer talking on a cellphone. The thought of the T-shirt buoyed his spirits. Ms. Mittelmann mentioned a tour they ran last year for a group of European academics studying squatting — the sweet spot of their target market, both said. “We talked about, one time, a protest fashion exhibit,” Ms. Mittelmann said. But as a longtime community activist, Mr. DiPaola seemed reflexively to prefer to talk about adversity. The location was inconvenient for European tourists, he said, the neighbors fractious; visitors might steal T-shirts at the opening party. The heat — finally restored after damage from Hurricane Sandy — was too high. Mr. DiPaola said he was not really sure how the museum would meet its expenses. “People can come into the museum for free,” he said. “Maybe they’ll buy a T-shirt.” He paused and looked around at all the work still to be done. “It’s going to be tough to get people interested in history,” he said.",

    "source": "Mortgage Servicers to Revamp Foreclosure Process <eos> The nation’s top mortgage servicers are expected to sign legal agreements by the end of this week compelling them to change their foreclosure procedures, regulatory officials said Tuesday. The servicers, which violated state and local laws and regulations governing foreclosures, are agreeing to improve their methods in numerous ways. They will be required to have more layers of oversight and proper training of their foreclosure staff. The oversight will extend to third party groups, including the law firms that do much of the actual work of eviction. Under the new rules, every homeowner in default will have a single point of contact with the servicer. The servicers will end their practice of foreclosing while borrowers are pursuing loan modifications that might allow them to stay in their homes. One of the most significant measures in the consent agreement will require servicers to hire an independent consultant to review foreclosures done over the last two years. If owners were improperly foreclosed on or paid excessive fees, they will be compensated. The reforms were described by individuals who spoke on condition of anonymity because the consent agreements were not yet public. The banks either could not be reached or declined to comment. Bringing in a consultant to establish the amount of damages will give individuals who feel they were abused by their servicer some means of redress. While the servicers have acknowledged violating the laws they maintain that very few if any people lost their house who were not in severe default. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, addressed the issue Tuesday at a banking conference in Washington. “Some of the mistakes were egregious, and they’re embarrassing,” he said, according to Bloomberg News. “But we made a mistake, and we’re going to pay for that mistake.” Many of the reforms that the servicers are agreeing to were also being sought by the state attorneys general, who began their own search for reform last fall. For several weeks in January, the regulators and the attorneys general attempted to work with officials from the Justice Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to produce one comprehensive settlement, but the attempt proved unwieldy. The attorneys general met face to face with the servicers for the first time last week at the Justice Department. A spokesman for Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who is leading the effort, said more meetings are planned but declined to be specific. The attorneys general have larger goals than the regulators. They are seeking to make the banks to cut the debt of delinquent owners. The servicers are balking at this. As a result of the changes being imposed by the banking regulators, servicers will have two options: either hire more employees to give the millions of households in default closer attention, or slow the pace of foreclosures. Foreclosure is already a ponderous process, and has grown more so since the controversy over the servicers’ procedures erupted last fall. The average household in foreclosure has been delinquent for more than 500 days. Regulators expect to issue their report on foreclosure practices at the top 14 servicers within the next few weeks. Preliminary consent agreements were sent to the servicers in February. The report, whose conclusions have been foreshadowed by regulators in Congressional testimony, derives from an investigation this winter by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It will not name individual banks but rather describe their aggregate behavior. The investigators reviewed the policies and procedures, structure and staffing of the top servicers, as well as their use of law firms and other third parties. They examined 2,800 foreclosures in various stages. The banks examined were Bank of America, Citibank, GMAC, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and nine others. The examination found critical deficiencies and shortcomings in foreclosure preparation and oversight, resulting in violations of state and local foreclosure laws, regulations and rules. The servicers will probably be assessed fines at a later point.",

The company’s revenue and earnings per share excluding special items exceeded Wall Street expectations. “We continue to take applications market share from SAP,” Oracle’s president, Charles E. Phillips Jr., said in a statement, referring to the German maker of business software that is one of its main rivals. Oracle is the leader in database software, ahead of I.B.M., but it trails SAP in business applications. Net income increased to $840 million, or 16 cents a share, in the period, which ended Aug. 31, from $670 million, or 13 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 26 percent, to $4.53 billion, surpassing the analyst target of $4.36 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Earnings, not counting items including stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related charges, were 22 cents a share, a penny above Wall Street expectations. The results were buoyed by the sales of products that were not in its lineup a year ago. Oracle added them after buying Hyperion Solutions, Stellent, MetaSolv and several other software makers over the last year. Revenue from new software licenses increased 35 percent from the period a year earlier, to $1.1 billion. Three months ago, Oracle told investors that it expected new-license revenue would increase by 20 to 30 percent from a year earlier. Oracle reported its results after the stock market closed. In Nasdaq trading Thursday, its shares rose 20 cents, to $21.04; after hours, they rose 11 cents more, to $21.15.",

    "source": "Ousted Executive Provides a Feminine Face to the McCain Campaign <eos> WASHINGTON — Three years ago, Carleton S. Fiorina was the celebrity C.E.O. who was spectacularly fired by the Hewlett-Packard board. She produced a best-selling memoir, “Tough Choices,” but for the most part spent the years after her ouster in relative self-imposed exile from public life. No longer. Ms. Fiorina, universally known as Carly, is back, this time reincarnated as a telegenic, take-no-prisoners surrogate for Senator John McCain . On MSNBC on Thursday, Ms. Fiorina praised Mr. McCain’s fund-raising prowess with the announcement that he had raised $21.5 million in May. Last month on the ABC program “This Week With George Stephanopoulos,” she pushed Mr. McCain’s proposal for a gasoline-tax holiday and brushed past the fact that she could not name a credible economist who supported it. In the months before that, Ms. Fiorina tirelessly promoted Mr. McCain’s economic proposals in round tables and news media interviews across the country. “When people were picking apart our tax cuts and saying, ‘This will cost a gazillion dollars,’ she’s very good about saying, ‘Come on, guys, let’s get the numbers and push back,’ ” said Mark Salter, one of Mr. McCain’s closest advisers. “She’s a very smart woman.” Ms. Fiorina’s official title is chairwoman of the Republican National Committee’s “Victory ’08” committee dedicated to electing Mr. McCain as president, and she is typically described as an economic adviser to the candidate. To some extent, she is. But Mr. McCain’s campaign advisers say her real role within their testosterone-heavy circle matters more: A high-profile female face for a candidate whose support among women lags substantially behind that of his Democratic rivals. “She has a great feeling for the economy, for technology and probably what women think about these things, and she’s wired in,” said Thomas J. Perkins, a pioneer venture capitalist and a leader on the Hewlett-Packard board in Ms. Fiorina’s ouster. (In the past, Mr. Perkins acknowledged, “we’ve had words and we’ve sort of attacked each other in print.”) In turn, a number of Republicans say Ms. Fiorina is using the McCain campaign to rebuild her image after her explosive tenure at Hewlett-Packard. They also say it is hard to see why a woman widely criticized for mismanaging one of Silicon Valley’s legendary companies is advising and representing a candidate who acknowledged last year that he did not understand the economy as well as he should. “Well, see, the good news about business is, results count,” Ms. Fiorina, 53, responded briskly in a recent interview in her office at Republican National Committee headquarters on Capitol Hill. “And the results have been very clear. The results have been crystal clear. From the day I was fired, every quarter, even before they had a new C.E.O., has been record after record. That doesn’t happen unless the foundation’s been built.” Opinion is still split on whether Ms. Fiorina or her successor as chief executive, Mark V. Hurd, deserve credit for Hewlett’s success after Ms. Fiorina drove through the company’s $25 billion acquisition of Compaq in 2002. By many accounts, Ms. Fiorina was superb at marketing, mixed on strategy, bad at execution — and extraordinarily successful in unifying the board against what Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management calls her “street bully” leadership style. “What a blind spot this is in the McCain campaign to have elevated her stature and centrality in this way,” said Mr. Sonnenfeld, the senior associate dean for executive programs at the management school and one of Ms. Fiorina’s sharpest critics. “You couldn’t pick a worse, non-imprisoned C.E.O. to be your standard-bearer.” But Mr. McCain, as Ms. Fiorina put it, does “clearly not” share the views of her critics. To the contrary, he so proudly calls on Ms. Fiorina in her regular appearances with him on the campaign trail — he calls her an American success story “who began as a part-time secretary” — that he seems to be suggesting that Ms. Fiorina, true or not, might have a role in a McCain cabinet. As a result, Ms. Fiorina has been buzzed about as a potential commerce or Treasury secretary or even as a McCain running mate, although some Republicans close to Mr. McCain swiftly dismiss the idea of her as vice president. But the view within the campaign is that it can only help Mr. McCain’s standing among women to have Ms. Fiorina mentioned as a possibility for high-profile office in a McCain administration, particularly when he is trying to win over the supporters of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. In the meantime, Ms. Fiorina has done little to tamp down speculation that she might run for office herself, including the California governorship in 2010. “I would be disingenuous if I said it has never occurred to me,” Ms. Fiorina said about running in general. “And in part it occurs to me because people keep asking. When I give speeches, people raise their hand — ‘run, run, run.’ ” For now, she said, “I’m focused on getting McCain elected.” Ms. Fiorina has been a regular at the campaign’s Saturday policy sessions at headquarters in Arlington, Va. — she was part of a group, including the candidate, behind Mr. McCain’s sharp pivot from warning against government intervention in the mortgage crisis to calling for government aid to people in danger of losing their homes — but she does not serve as a bridge for the candidate to the business or financial community, in large part because of her tenure at Hewlett-Packard. “It’s difficult to say that she is the unequivocal success figure that resonates with Wall Street,” said A.M. Sacconaghi, an analyst who tracks Hewlett-Packard for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company Ms. Fiorina, whose late father, Joseph T. Sneed 3rd, was a conservative federal appeals court judge and a member of the panel that appointed Kenneth W. Starr as a special prosecutor into the Clintons’ Whitewater dealings, first met Mr. McCain after she testified on Capitol Hill in 2000. Mr. McCain had just abandoned his presidential run against George W. Bush and Ms. Fiorina, who asked to see the senator in his office, left impressed that he was savvy to technological innovation. “He just got it,” she said. Ms. Fiorina, who is married to a former AT&T executive, Frank J. Fiorina, and has two stepdaughters, now divides her time between a condominium in Washington and a home in Silicon Valley. She received a severance package from Hewlett-Packard worth more than $42 million (Mr. McCain denounced excessive executive pay in an economic speech in Pittsburgh last month) and said in the interview that one of the biggest differences between her new life and her old is that “I’m not deciding.” That was clear on a recent morning on the McCain campaign bus, when the candidate summoned Fortune’s onetime “most powerful woman in business” to sing to him and an audience of reporters in the back. The selection was “We’re Strong for Toledo,” which Mr. McCain had heard from Ms. Fiorina at an Ohio fund-raiser the night before. Ms. Fiorina, embarrassed but not at all shy, did as she was told. “Now we know the secret of her success,” Mr. McCain enthused when Ms. Fiorina was done with her serenade.",

    "source": "A Day for Chicken Sandwiches as Proxy in a Cultural Debate <eos> ATLANTA — The chicken sandwich culture wars are on, at least here in the city where Chick-fil-A began in 1946 as a diner feeding factory workers. All day long Wednesday, restaurants were packed largely with conservative Christians who showed up for a Chick-fil-A appreciation day, an event organized by former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas after the company was targeted as being antigay. The founder, S. Truett Cathy, built the company on biblical principles, and he and his family have given millions of dollars to organizations trying to stop same-sex marriage . But recent comments by the company’s president, Dan T. Cathy, about the biblical injunctions against homosexuality set up eating at the chain as a kind of cultural litmus test. For many, it comes down to this: Eating at Chick-fil-A supports heterosexual marriage and religious freedom. Refusing to eat there supports same-sex marriage and equality. Although the company has a deep Southern identity and a cultlike status among some people, it has grown into a national powerhouse. There are more than 1,600 restaurants in 39 states, and sales last year were $4.1 billion. On Wednesday, people aligned with the company’s views piled into restaurants in several states. At some restaurants here, parking was a problem and a lunch that might have taken five minutes to pick up stretched into a half-hour wait. People in long drive-through lines bought food for the people in the cars behind them, who then did the same for the next car. “If you are serious about your relationship with Jesus Christ, you just can’t be for same-sex marriage,” said Corliss Carter, 44, who ate lunch at a Marietta, Ga., restaurant. “Chick-fil-A has always been a family-oriented business. We’re just showing our support for them.” Workers at the restaurant declined to comment, instead handing statements to members of the news media giving a little background on the company and reiterating its intention to treat every person in its restaurants with “honor, dignity and respect,” regardless of race, creed, gender or sexual orientation. For some, the issue was not as much about biblical principles or same-sex marriage as it was about freedom of speech. “This is America, and we’re free to speak our minds,” said Neil Greenlee, 49, of Atlanta. “I feel like Chick-fil-A has been unfairly singled out.” As a gesture of support, he planned to eat Chick-fil-A for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Of course, for every action there is a reaction. The company’s positive perception among consumers has fallen sharply, said Ted Marzilli, managing director of the BrandIndex survey, which keeps a daily index of the popularity of 1,100 consumer brands, including all the major fast-food outlets. People who support same-sex marriage and oppose the company’s position are organizing a kiss-in on Friday at the restaurants. Meanwhile, restaurants from Manhattan to Atlanta have taken to serving their own version of the company’s signature fried chicken sandwich as a Chick-fil-A alternative. Cooks are taking things into their own hands, too. J. Kenji López-Alt on the New York-based Web site Serious Eats reverse-engineered a sandwich and offered a recipe in his column, The Food Lab. That prompted Sarah Laskow, on the site Grist, to comment, “It’s still possible to get your fried chicken sandwich fix and keep your moral principles intact.”",

    "source": "In Reborn Harlem, Liquor Store Draws Complaints <eos> Many neighbors agree that their genteel enclave of brownstones in the heart of Harlem does need a shop where they can pick up, say, a good cabernet for a dinner party. But the liquor store seeking to open on Lenox Avenue near 119th Street is decidedly not what they have in mind. With its roll-down steel gate, its bulletproof plexiglass to guard against robbers and drunken vagrants, and its flamboyant red-and-yellow sign, the store is a throwback to the old crime-ridden, ramshackle Harlem, some neighbors say, not the reborn Harlem they have been advancing during the past decade. “We want to be Park Slope with charming little stores and become a destination for people,” said Ruthann Richert, a 25-year resident who is treasurer of a local group, the Mount Morris Park Community Improvement Association . “A store like that is going to attract the people hanging out, drinking wine, so if you’re looking to buy a $30 bottle of wine, you’re not going to go in there.” Laurent Delly, a Haitian-born engineer and real estate agent who is the association’s vice president, was especially unhappy with the sign. “I wouldn’t use the word ghetto, but I would say it’s garish,” he said. The association has gotten the city’s Department of Buildings to stop construction work at the liquor store, mostly because the owner did not get permission from the Landmarks Preservation Commission to change the appearance of the building, in what is designated the Mount Morris Park Historic District . Berihu Mesfin, the owner of the liquor store, said his landlord had authorized the sign, which he said was similar to that of a beauty parlor that had been in the same space. He also said he had been advised to get plexiglass barriers for security. He said he was willing to make some changes to placate neighbors, but noted that he had already spent $3,500 on signage. “It’s expensive,” he said. “I have to talk to management.” The advent of the liquor store has crystallized the tensions that flow from a neighborhood in metamorphosis. Almost every brownstone that in the 1980s was abandoned or city-owned is now fetching a price of $3 million, with individual condominiums going for $1 million. Residents include the poet Maya Angelou and the documentary filmmaker Albert Maysles. Cafes, cheerful flower and toy shops, and fine restaurants like Settepani , where former President Bill Clinton had a birthday party, are taking over once-forlorn spaces. Crime in the 28th Precinct, which includes the area, has dropped by 70 percent in less than two decades, with 6 murders in 2010, compared with 41 in 1990. The ambience is Bloomsbury-like, calm and demure. But what residents call the second Harlem Renaissance has made the neighborhood less congenial for poorer residents who may want a cheap liquor store, a bodega that accepts food stamps or a place to cash welfare checks. “I don’t see a problem with liquor,” said Rooster Pickering, a 65-year-old unemployed construction worker who was idling with three other men on a stoop next to the liquor store. “The smaller people, they’re trying to push them out.” One woman who lives in a brownstone and who asked not to be identified said she worried that the campaign against the liquor store might take on an “elitist tone.” Yet others argue that they have won the right to push for a more decorous neighborhood, having been pioneers when much of the area was in tatters and plagued by crack cocaine and violence. “I feel I’ve earned my stripes,” said Leah Abraham, an Ethiopian immigrant who opened Settepani with her husband, Nino Settepani, 10 years ago and moved into a Harlem brownstone five years ago. “I was held up at gunpoint twice. I strongly believe I’m doing good in the community. Everybody wants the best.” The struggle sometimes has a racial and class edge because gentrification has attracted an influx of white and black professionals and an outflow of poorer blacks. The historic district stretches over 16 blocks from West 118th Street to 124th Street, roughly taking in the west side of Lenox Avenue almost to Fifth Avenue. Its collection of Gilded Age town houses and Romanesque Revival churches is regarded as among the city’s grandest. (The park itself was renamed Marcus Garvey Park in 1973 after the Jamaica-born black nationalist leader.) When Ms. Richert moved to Harlem in 1987, many of the buildings were boarded up, and she remembers kicking crack vials aside while walking with her two children. All that changed with increasing investments and the steady stream of newcomers glad to pick up handsome brownstones for $250,000. The invigorated Mount Morris Park neighborhood became a draw for sightseeing buses and movie locations. With its wide sidewalks, Lenox Avenue, also known as Malcolm X Boulevard, was once again thought of as “our Champs-Elysée,” Mr. Delly said. Lenox Avenue still has ragged grocery stores, but members of the association view the liquor store as a brash newcomer that must obey the new unwritten rules. “It’s not the business we disagree with, it’s the aesthetics,” Ms. Richert said. Ms. Abraham said the liquor store owner thought he was doing good in opening the store. “I don’t begrudge him that,” she said. “But he didn’t study the neighborhood. You could get away with this 20 years ago. You can’t today.”",

    "source": "N.B.A.’s Nets Pursuing Sponsors in Russia and Beyond <eos> The Nets might be an odd choice to be the N.B.A. ’s ambassador overseas. With 12 wins last season, they are often a forgotten team even in New Jersey, where they fail to sell out their home games and live in the shadow of the cosmopolitan Knicks. Yet the Nets are among the most active teams in courting international companies. Last year, six Chinese companies, including the electronics giant Haier , paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for courtside signs at the Izod Center, where Yi Jianlian played for the Nets. Yi was traded in the off-season, so the Nets are now focused on Russia, the home of their new owner, Mikhail D. Prokhorov , who took over the team in May. The Nets lack a Russian player, but team executives have met with dozens of companies in Russia hoping to convince a few of them that advertising with the team is a good way to reach American and Russian consumers. On Thursday, the Nets announced a five-year sponsorship deal with Stolichnaya, the Russian vodka producer. The agreement, which Prokhorov helped arrange, is worth about $2 million a year and will include sponsored bars at the Barclays Center , the Nets arena being built in Brooklyn. The Nets hope to complete more deals when they visit Moscow on Sunday on their way to China, where they will play two preseason games. In Moscow, the Nets will hold a clinic for 3,000 youngsters, attend a ribbon-cutting at an Adidas store that will feature Nets gear and schmooze with businesspeople at a reception. “We have been talking about the Nets being a global team, and it seems really fitting that, as the first foreign owner of an N.B.A. franchise, their first trip should be to my country,” Prokhorov said in a statement. “It is my hope that the Nets will be the team the country roots for once the season gets under way.” Are the Nets’ efforts to court international companies a sign that they are having trouble attracting sponsors at home? Some sports marketing analysts say that the Nets are smart to piggyback on the N.B.A.’s popularity overseas, where basketball is growing faster than in the United States. “I don’t believe it’s a sign of weakness, but that sports business is global,” said David Carter, who teaches sports business at the University of Southern California. “It’s a chance for the team to build its overall brand, and big brands do well.” The Nets are not the first team to make a push overseas. The Houston Rockets have become a brand name in China because of Yao Ming, their center. Thaddeus B. Brown, the Rockets’ chief executive, said five Chinese companies had courtside signs, and Anheuser-Busch and HP have signs in Mandarin at the team’s arena in Houston. About 65 Rockets games were broadcast in China last season; the league collects revenue from broadcast rights. Revenue from the sale of licensed merchandise is split equally by all 30 teams. The Knicks are getting into the act, too. This month, they played preseason games in Milan and Paris to showcase Danilo Gallinari, their Italian-born forward, and Mike D’Antoni, their coach, who played in Italy. N.B.A. teams have played games overseas for at least two decades. In addition to sending teams to preseason games in China, France, Italy and Spain this year, the Nets will play two regular-season games against the Toronto Raptors in London in March. The league and its teams see the games as a foothold to sell jerseys, sponsorships and television deals in Europe and Asia, and potentially attract other foreign owners. The games also mirror the changing face of the league; 20 percent of the players in the N.B.A. were born overseas. “Our goal is to grow the interest in the game and ultimately in the N.B.A. in markets throughout the world with the recognition that, over time, fans in those countries will want to watch our games on television or various forms of digital media,” said Adam Silver, the deputy commissioner of the N.B.A. Russia, Silver acknowledged, is a relatively untapped market. Although N.B.A. games have been on television in Russia for more than a dozen years, basketball remains a distant third behind soccer and hockey in popularity. There are only a handful of Russian players in the N.B.A., most notably Andrei Kirilenko of the Utah Jazz and Timofey Mozgov of the Knicks. To increase its exposure in Russia, the league opened an office in Moscow this summer and has signed sponsorship deals with Adidas, EA, Nike and others. CSKA Moscow, a team once owned by Prokhorov, will play exhibition games against the Miami Heat, the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Cleveland Cavaliers next week. Prokhorov plans to deepen ties further, not just because he is Russian, but because the Nets plan to move to Brooklyn, which has a large Russian-born population. In all, 250,000 people claim Russian ancestry in New York City, 75,000 of whom say they were born in Russia, according to census figures. The Nets are creating a Russian-language Web site to better reach them, and have replaced a marketing specialist who spoke Mandarin with someone fluent in Russian. Still, signing deals with Russian companies will be more of a chore than finding clients in China, where basketball has made deeper inroads with fans and companies. “If I can get three or four solid deals after my first year, I’d be pleased,” said Brett Yormark, the chief executive of the Nets. REBOUNDS Stephen Graham hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer and the host Nets rallied from a 7-point deficit in the final 15 seconds to defeat the Philadelphia 76ers, 90-89, on Saturday in a preseason game. Anthony Morrow cut the 76ers’ 88-81 lead to 4 points with a 3-pointer with a little less than 13 seconds to play, then the Nets took advantage of poor free-throw shooting by Philadelphia to get the improbable win.

    "source": "Georgia Promises New Look at Freddie Woodruff Killing <eos> STRASBOURG, France — The new government of Georgia is taking a new look at one of the unsolved mysteries left over from the chaotic collapse of the Soviet Union: the shooting death of a C.I.A. officer, Freddie Woodruff, on a dusty road on the outskirts of the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, 20 years ago. “The case has not been properly investigated,” said Justice Minister Tea Tsulukiani, referring to the failure of previous governments to present a plausible explanation for the killing, which took place on Aug. 8, 1993, amid fierce jockeying for influence between Moscow and Washington in the newly independent nation. “We have some serious doubts about what really happened,” she added in an interview during a visit to the Strasbourg-based Council of Europe along with Georgia’s prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili, an enigmatic billionaire who took office after parliamentary elections last October. Michael Pullara, a lawyer based in Houston who has studied the Woodruff murder case closely and lobbied for years for a new investigation, said he was “absolutely delighted” by Georgia’s apparent readiness to re-examine the murky saga. He added that despite the passage of so many years, “a lot of the missing pieces have now been found and it is possible to know the truth.” Georgia attributed Mr. Woodruff’s death to a random shot fired by a drunken Georgian, a former Soviet soldier. The suspect, Anzor Sharmaidze, was swiftly convicted of murder in 1994 and sentenced to 15 years in prison, a term later extended to 18 and a half years. He was quietly released from jail in 2008 after witnesses recanted their testimony and said they had been tortured into implicating him. Ms. Tsulukiani said she had not examined the file closely. But she believes that Mr. Sharmaidze was jailed only because “they badly needed to find someone” to take the blame for a killing that severely embarrassed Georgia’s leader at the time, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, and raised concerns in Washington about his grip on the country. Georgia’s justice system has long been tainted by political meddling, and a primary purpose of Mr. Ivanishvili’s visit to Strasbourg last week was to assure European officials and legislators that his new government was committed to the rule of law. His political opponents, notably Mikheil Saakashvili, the country’s pro-American president, accuse him of using the judiciary to settle political scores. A number of Mr. Saakashvili’s allies have been placed under investigation and, according to Mr. Ivanishvili, there is a “high probability” that the president, who last week started a visit to the United States, will be prosecuted for corruption and other misdeeds, including the use of violence by riot police officers against a Tbilisi protest in 2011. Giga Bokeria, President Saakashvili’s national security adviser, said the prosecution of the president’s supporters gave a “clear picture of at best selective justice, or at worst outright political persecution.” He said “no credible evidence” had been presented against Mr. Saakashvili, who has not been charged with any crime, and described the prime minister’s remarks as “just another attempt to discredit a major political rival.” Image Freddie Woodruff led a C.I.A. post in Georgia after the Soviet Union collapsed. He was killed in a car by a shot to the head. Mr. Pullara said in a telephone interview that getting to the bottom of Mr. Woodruff’s death “is a litmus test of the new government’s commitment to justice.” Though released from jail, Mr. Sharmaidze has not been formally cleared of murder. “His life has been destroyed,” Mr. Pullara said. He described him as a victim of a “cruel compromise for reasons of expediency” — a fall guy who satisfied both Washington’s desire for a culprit and Moscow’s desire that Russia be kept distant from any hint of involvement in the murder. Rivalry between Russia and the United States has weighed heavily on Georgia since the Soviet Union dissolved in December 1991. In the turbulent years that followed, Washington moved quickly to establish a strong presence in the former Soviet republic, including the establishment of a C.I.A. post in the Georgian capital headed by Mr. Woodruff, who was the agency’s director for the Caucasus region. Shortly before his death, he was the host of a visit to Tbilisi by Aldrich Ames, a senior C.I.A. official who was later jailed as a spy for Moscow. Mr. Woodruff was hit in the head by a single bullet while sitting in the back seat of a car driven by Eldar Gogoladze, a veteran Soviet security officer who was working at the time as the head of Mr. Shevardnadze’s security detail. Washington and Moscow continue to spar over Georgia and are both watching closely how Mr. Ivanishvili handles relations between the two former cold war enemies. A wealthy businessman who made most of his money in Russia, Mr. Ivanishvili has sought to warm previously ice-cold relations with Moscow. But in an interview, he said his government intended to maintain Georgia’s pro-Western orientation and would press ahead with efforts to join NATO, despite objections from Moscow. He said the Boston Marathon bombing showed that Russia, the United States and Georgia shared a common foe in Chechen militancy, and he pledged to end what he said was the previous government’s tolerance of Chechen separatist fighters passing through Georgia. “We know that Georgia was used for years as a transit point for fighters,” Mr. Ivanishvili said. “We will stop this by all means. This will not happen now.” He added that an investigation was under way into suspicions that “the previous government was cooperating with the fighters.” Describing Mr. Saakashvili as “a professional liar,” he said officials in Washington and Europe had been “misled” about his own government’s intentions by the charismatic, English-speaking president. “They now see his real face,” said the prime minister. Mr. Bokeria, Mr. Saakashvili’s national security adviser, dismissed the prime minister’s comments as “politically motivated accusations” that had no basis in fact. “There has never been any credible evidence that Georgia under President Saakashvili has allowed any armed groups to cross into Russian territory,” he said. “There are no credible facts to back these assertions because they are completely false.”",

The plan, filed Monday in federal court, calls for 143 people who said they were abused to receive $40.7 million. About $13.75 million will be set aside for 26 people who may settle or sue the archdiocese; $20 million will cover future claims. Insurance companies will pay $51.75 million. The remainder is to come from archdiocesan holdings and loans. Before bankruptcy, the archdiocese had paid more than $50 million to settle 130 claims against priests.",

    "source": "Mixed Reviews on Program for Immigrants with Criminal Records <eos> Senior Obama administration officials created major confusion for state and local authorities by providing inconsistent information about a high-profile federal program to identify illegal immigrants who committed crimes, according to a stinging report published Friday by the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security . The mixed messages about the expansion of the program, known as Secure Communities, from officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement led directly to “opposition, criticism and resistance in some locations,” the inspector general, Charles K. Edwards, found. But in a second report released on Friday, the inspector general’s office found that despite the rocky start and continuing political disputes, Secure Communities has been effective at rapidly identifying more immigrants who committed serious crimes — and in many more places — than efforts in the past, and at a very low cost to states. The program is a centerpiece of the Obama administration’s immigration enforcement policy, intended to increase the number of convicted criminals among about 400,000 immigrants deported each year. The second report found that enforcement officers had a good understanding of priorities set by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for detaining and deporting immigrants identified under the program, making decisions in line with its priorities in 97 percent of 723 cases that auditors reviewed. The back-to-back reports brought both an embarrassing critique of the performance of officials at the immigration agency, known as ICE, as they extended the program across the country, but also an endorsement by the inspector general’s office of its effectiveness in some aspects. Officials have said they plan to spread Secure Communities nationwide by next year. Amid conflicting statements from ICE officials about whether the program was mandatory, governors of several states — including Illinois, Massachusetts and New York — have sought to withdraw from Secure Communities. The program has drawn an outcry from many immigrant organizations, which contend that it has led to the separation of families and the deportation of many immigrants here illegally who did not actually have criminal records. Under Secure Communities, fingerprints of anyone arrested by the police are checked against both F.B.I. criminal databases, a routine procedure, and also against databases of the Department of Homeland Security, which hold records of all foreign-born people in the immigration system. As of last December, the program was operating in 44 states, covering 64 percent of local law enforcement jurisdictions. Under ICE’s priorities, agents are instructed to accelerate deportations of serious offenders, but exercise prosecutorial discretion to suspend deportations of illegal immigrants who do not have criminal convictions. The inspector general “did not find evidence that ICE intentionally misled” local officials or the public about Secure Communities. But the report includes a chronological roster of misstatements and conflicting documents issued by ICE officials — including the director, John Morton — about whether states could opt out of the program. While ICE indicated during 2009 and 2010 that the program was voluntary, officials eventually settled on the position that states could not withdraw. The report finds that the officials failed to set clear policies internally and “missed opportunities” to clarify the situation. In a statement Friday, Nicole Navas, a spokeswoman for ICE, said that the agency had taken “aggressive steps” in the past year to provide clearer guidance about the program. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has acknowledged that her department fumbled communications about Secure Communities. Homeland Security officials said Friday that they were in the final stages of preparing new guidelines to govern the program, as the inspector general urged. Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, the ranking Democrat on the House immigration subcommittee, wrote a letter last year that prompted the inspector general’s review. She said Friday that she was “frankly disappointed” with the reports, saying they failed to answer several of her questions: “Does the program also ensnare victims and others with no criminal history? Is it susceptible to racial profiling?” Immigrant advocates said the inspector general reports showed that the Secure Communities program should be canceled. “In an attempt to justify the program, the reports inadvertently admit that ICE has mutated S-Comm into an overreaching dragnet,” said Sarahi Uribe, of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network , one of the most staunch opponents of the program.",

    "source": "Republican Governor of Florida Says State Won’t Expand Medicaid <eos> WASHINGTON — In another sign of resistance to President Obama’s health care overhaul , Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, said Monday that his state would not expand its Medicaid program. Florida is the largest state to say so firmly that it will take advantage of a new option granted by the Supreme Court decision on the health care law. The 2010 law calls for a sweeping expansion of Medicaid, to add 17 million people to the rolls, accounting for half of all the uninsured people expected to gain coverage nationwide. “Florida will opt out of spending approximately $1.9 billion more taxpayer dollars required to implement a massive entitlement expansion of the Medicaid program,” said Mr. Scott, a former health care executive. More than one-fifth of Florida residents — roughly 4 million of 19 million people — lack health insurance. Mr. Scott also rejected another provision of the new federal law, saying Florida would not set up a health insurance exchange, or a regulated market where people can shop for coverage. The governor acknowledged that for three years, from 2014 to 2016, the federal government would pay all the costs of covering people newly eligible for Medicaid. But, he said, “the burden increasingly shifts to Florida taxpayers in future years.” Mr. Scott said Medicaid was “growing three and a half times as fast as Florida’s general revenue” and was gobbling up money needed for education. Obama administration officials said they were not worried by the rumblings among Republican officials in Florida and other states. Obama aides predicted that all states would eventually expand Medicaid and set up exchanges when they realized the benefits. “The vast majority of states will come in,” Jacob J. Lew, the White House chief of staff, said Sunday on the ABC News program “This Week.” “For those few that are slow to come in, they’re going to have to answer to people why they’re turning this down and why they’re letting people go without coverage.” Congress required states to expand Medicaid to cover nonelderly people with incomes less than or equal to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (up to $25,390 for a family of three). But the Supreme Court said that the change was optional, and that the federal government could not penalize recalcitrant states by withholding money they receive under the existing Medicaid program. Republicans in Congress are encouraging continued state opposition to the federal law, which was upheld last week by the Supreme Court . A group of Republican lawmakers — 12 senators and 61 House members — said Monday that they had sent a letter to governors urging them not to set up insurance exchanges. It now appears that the federal government could be running the exchanges in one-third to half of all states in 2014, far more than lawmakers assumed when they passed the law. Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, a Republican, said Monday that she would not set up an exchange because “states have little meaningful flexibility under the Obama administration’s concept of state-based exchanges.” A Texas official welcomed the Supreme Court decision, saying it provided an opportunity for states to “push back against” the expansion of Medicaid. “Medicaid already consumes a quarter of the state budget in Texas, and enrollment and costs would mushroom under the Affordable Care Act,” said the official, Thomas M. Suehs, the executive commissioner of health and human services. Miriam E. Harmatz, a lawyer at Florida Legal Services , said Mr. Scott’s action was “a terrible decision for our clients, who would have benefited from the expansion of Medicaid, and a shortsighted decision for the economy of the state,” which would have benefited from an infusion of federal Medicaid money into the health care industry. Bruce Rueben, president of the Florida Hospital Association , said he hoped Mr. Scott would reconsider and reverse his decision on Medicaid. Deborah S. Bachrach, a former Medicaid director in New York, said, “Many states will accept the Medicaid expansion, given that the federal government is paying all the costs in the short term and most of the costs in the long term.”",

    "source": "Food Makers and Critics Break Bread <eos> IF you want to get an earful about the sins of the food industry, spend a few hours with Kelly D. Brownell. Mr. Brownell, 54, is the chairman of the psychology department at Yale University. Early in his career, he conducted clinical trials aimed at treating obesity, and issues surrounding the obesity crisis -- nutrition, portion size, the prevalence of junk food, and so on -- have long been his primary focus. Not 10 minutes after I'd met him, Mr. Brownell was showing me the slide show he uses to accompany his standard speech about obesity. \"Can You Identify This Food?\" one slide asked, and listed 56 ingredients, most of them unpronounceable. The next slide showed the answer: a Kellogg's Pop-Tart. He has a slide picturing baby bottles with the logos of 7Up, Pepsi and Dr Pepper. \"This is where it starts,\" he said with visible disgust. \"This is exploitation of children. Joe Camel is off the billboards, but Ronald McDonald is fine.\" He has a series of United States maps that chart the startling increase in the percentage of overweight Americans, state by state, from 1985 to 2003. \"There is plenty of nutrition education done in this country,\" Mr. Brownell said. \"It is done by the food industry. It has convinced us that fruit roll-ups are healthy, and that a cereal that is half its weight in sugar is part of a nutritious diet.\" He added, \"The increasing prevalence of obesity is like a hundred-car freight train going downhill with no brakes. And our country's response has been to stand outside the tracks and ask it to slow down.\" A year ago, in an effort to do something more than simply agitate, Mr. Brownell founded the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale. Part of its mission is to fight \"weight bias\" -- that is, prejudice against overweight and obese people, which is the passion of Leslie Rudd, a California entrepreneur who gave Mr. Brownell $7.5 million to establish the center. But Mr. Brownell also wants to use the center to \"change the world's diet.\" He hopes the center will be a place where people can dream up wholly original -- even radical -- ideas that go beyond the tried and true. Back in 1994, Mr. Brownell showed that he was willing to broach such ideas when he proposed, in The New York Times, that unhealthy food be taxed as a way of helping people change their diets. (The food industry and its allies quickly derided his proposal as the \"Twinkie tax.\") He wants the center to do persuasive, unbiased studies, and to come up with public policy ideas that can truly change the way we eat. And here's something else the Rudd Center is doing. Mr. Brownell has begun a program called safe space, where public health advocates and food industry critics can meet privately with industry representatives, and where they can do something they don't do very often: talk. Not fight, not argue, not debate, but really talk. Listen to what the other side has to say. Search for common ground. Devise approaches and strategies that people on both sides can agree on. Now there's an out-of-the-box idea. WHENEVER a company or an industry finds itself under attack, its instinct is to attack right back. Think about the tobacco industry for much of its history, or General Electric dealing with the Hudson River pollution problem, or timber companies and environmentalists, or Wal-Mart and its critics. Initially, executives tend to view the critics as misguided naifs -- they don't understand the good the company does, or the complexity of the problem. As the criticism increases, these positions not only harden, they darken. The critics become the enemy. Of course, the same thing happens on the other side. Corporations become demonized, and the activists come to see themselves as people at war with an evil industry. Not long ago, for instance, I asked a tobacco control advocate what his ultimate goal was. To my surprise, the first words out of his mouth were not \"to get fewer people to smoke\"; they were \"to destroy the tobacco industry.\" Many rituals of American society only worsen the problem. Companies that concede they did something wrong will inevitably be buried in litigation. Just ask Merck, which thought it would be applauded for withdrawing Vioxx, but instead faces thousands of lawsuits. And then there's the media, which revels in conflict. \"When I'm on 'Nightline' with the head of the grocery lobby, it is going to be about debate and conflict,\" Mr. Brownell said. Nobody, of course, is talking about destroying the food industry. \"We need the food industry to feed us,\" said David S. Ludwig, the director for the obesity program at Children's Hospital in Boston. And the food industry is not as monolithic as other industries; there are many companies, starting with PepsiCo, that badly want to get out in front of the obesity problem. \"As recently as five years ago, there was a temptation on the part of industry to frame the issue in terms of personal responsibility, physical activity and choice,\" said Sylvia Rowe, a consultant who formerly ran the International Food Information Council, an industry-financed group that specializes in food science and nutrition. \"But now there is a genuine recognition that they have a role and a responsibility.\" And in those two basic facts -- that the activists don't want to drive the industry into the sea, and the industry realizes it has to engage with the problem -- Mr. Brownell saw opportunity. The point of his safe space idea was to give each side a place where it could put aside its talking points, speak with rare honesty, and not have to worry that anything it said might wind up haunting it in the courtroom or in the media. Mr. Brownell's first big safe space meeting was held last summer. \"We wanted to take on the toughest issue: soft drinks in schools,\" Mr. Brownell said. There were representatives from Coca-Cola, Pepsi and the American Beverage Association, as well as scientists and public health advocates. The meeting was led by Mr. Brownell and a lawyer who represents the beverage industry. It was decided beforehand that neither side would talk to the media in detail about what happened, to help ensure that the space was, indeed, safe. \"From our point of view, we wanted to see if there were places where profitability and health might intersect,\" Mr. Brownell said. \"My goal is to have children drink healthier beverages. Their goal is to maximize profits. So one question I asked them was whether they were agnostic as to which beverages kids were drinking, so long as they were selling them. If they make as much on bottled water as on a soft drink, is that O.K.? We could ask that question and get an honest answer.\" The Pepsi representative at the meeting, Brock Leach, told Mr. Brownell that the answer to that question, from his company's point of view, was yes. In 2002, \"we made a commitment that half of our new products would be better for you,\" he told me. Last year, he added, two-thirds of the company's growth in North America came from its healthier products. \"There is clearly a business case for this,\" he said. On the other hand, Mr. Leach also said he felt that the food industry's critics spent too much time trying to restrict marketing, \"and not enough on putting out better food.\" \"That is going to be the solution. Our point is why don't you focus more on that end of the equation.\" He said that during the safe space meeting as well. Mr. Brownell, though a critic of much industry marketing, agrees with him. I should note that not every activist is as enthused about the safe space idea as Mr. Brownell is. \"My experience is that if you try for 35 years to talk to them and don't see much progress, you try other approaches,\" said Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. His preferred method to change the industry is to threaten to sue. Recently, as a result of a threatened lawsuit, \"the makers of Aunt Jemima frozen blueberry waffles no longer pretend that their waffles are made with blueberries,\" he wrote in a recent issue of the center's newsletter. He is also now openly threatening to sue the beverage industry over soft drinks in schools. \"We have good discussions with industry,\" he said. \"They're called negotiations.\" Mr. Brownell concedes that what he is doing is an experiment that might not work. But I think it is worth the try. Litigation threats might force Aunt Jemima to come clean about its blueberry waffles, but the product itself hasn't become any healthier. And in any case, litigation is more a tool for punishing wrongdoing than changing public policy, where it usually fails. There is a chance that by bringing the parties together, and offering them a safe space, something bigger could be accomplished than changing a waffle label. Indeed, Mr. Brownell told me that by the end of the meeting with the beverage industry, they had come up with two projects they are now pursuing. But he wouldn't tell me what they were because that would violate the rules of engagement. When I put the question to Susan Neely, the president of the American Beverage Association, she declined as well. As a journalist, I would normally be miffed by this. But this one time, I'm not. It seems like progress.",

    "source": "N.F.L.’s Replacement Referees Wake Up From a Dream <eos> To many, they will be remembered as impostors, a band of striped, whistle-blowing charlatans who crept onto the biggest stage in sports for a few weeks of singular and unabated outrage. For the replacement officials themselves, though, the experience of working at the heart of the N.F.L. ’s most recent controversy was more nuanced: refereeing football’s highest level of games will never be forgotten, of course, but neither will the frustration that came with becoming a punching bag for bloggers and broadcasters, players and coaches, television animators and late-night talk show hosts. “My daughter found the ‘Call Me Maybe’ video they did of us and showed it to me, and I had to laugh,” said Jeff Sadorus, a former college official who worked as a field judge during the recent lockout of the N.F.L.’s regular officials. “Honestly, sometimes during this whole thing it felt like the national pastime in this country had changed from football to bashing replacement officials.” He added: “Everyone wanted perfection, but come on: the last guy who was perfect they nailed to a cross. And he wasn’t even an official.” While employed by the league, the replacements were bound by its standard media policy, meaning they could not do interviews even as consternation over their performance grew. With the regular officials returning to work Thursday night, however, Sadorus — who also returned to his job, at a food services company near Seattle — described the up-and-down nature of his N.F.L. tenure in an interview with The New York Times. Ultimately, he said, it was a dream — “something I had wanted to do forever and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” — but that does not mean it was without difficulty. Sadorus detailed a drama that played out over about four months and included clinics, camps, exhibitions and games, as well as nearly 25,000 miles of travel and the constant awareness that every decision he and his colleagues made was under “unprecedented scrutiny,” according to Commissioner Roger Goodell. For his work, Sadorus received a generous stipend — $3,000 per game — but had to take with it an unending barrage of criticism, as replacement-official ripping dominated the news media. The replacements were even satirized on the popular animated show “South Park.” “It was the only thing on TV; it was everywhere,” Sadorus said, adding that now that the lockout is over, he and his colleagues might not even get to keep their league-issued officials shirts. “I think in the contract we signed, it said we had to return the equipment,” he said. “It’s O.K. — I have a lot of stripes.” As he watched the controversial conclusion to Monday night’s game between Seattle and Green Bay — a disastrous sequence that many believe pushed the labor dispute toward its ultimate resolution — Sadorus felt for the officials involved because he had been in their situation. The night before, he was the official who ruled that a Ravens field goal that went over the top of an upright was good, giving Baltimore a victory over the New England Patriots. While that call was ultimately shown to be correct, it nonetheless prompted a visceral reaction from the Patriots, including Coach Bill Belichick, who grabbed one of Sadorus’s crew mates as the official ran off the field. Belichick was fined $50,000 by the league. “Working these games was something I’d wanted to do forever,” Sadorus said, “and there were some incredible moments. But there were also parts of this that I don’t think anyone could have expected.” The process began, Sadorus said, near the end of May, when he was sent an e-mail from an area scout who was gauging interest from potential replacements. Sadorus — who worked in the Pacific-10 Conference until 2010, occasionally officiated at Seattle Seahawks practices (which drew some attention when he became a replacement ), and still officiates high school games — immediately responded positively. Not long after, he attended a rules clinic and fitness test in Dallas where replacement hopefuls were put through a rigorous running exam — in searing heat — in an attempt to identify the best candidates. Sadorus, who was one of the more experienced officials, made it through the exams and was notified in a mid-July e-mail that he had been placed on a replacement crew. He also received a letter from Goodell, thanking him for his service. For a lifelong fan of officials, getting the assignment was heavenly. Sadorus’s father was a college official, and even as a young boy, Sadorus said, he could flip on the TV and immediately identify whether an American Football League or N.F.L. game was on by the types of shirts the officials were wearing. Sadorus acknowledged that becoming a replacement was a complex professional choice — doing so probably hurt some officials’ chances at working top college games in the future because many N.F.L. referees are also college supervisors — as well as a difficult ethical decision. Those replacements who were friendly with the regular N.F.L. officials beforehand may now have strained relationships. “We weren’t there to take anyone’s job; we were there to provide a service,” Sadorus said. “The games were going to get done by someone. It’s the old saying: without officials, it’s just recess.” After being notified of their selection, most of the replacements then spent time officiating at a team’s preseason training camp (Sadorus was with San Francisco). But despite a crash course of instruction, the disparagement of the replacements began early on. Many of the fill-ins had far less experience than Sadorus — some had never worked higher than Division III college games — and it was clear that they were often overmatched by the speed of the N.F.L. Still, the league defended the replacements vigorously, and Sadorus said they were treated like the regular officials. They spent hours on weekly video review. They had conference calls with supervisors. They did refresher rules quizzes. In the end, though, they were still skewered, somewhat souring an experience that should have been something closer to a referee’s pinnacle. “We worked very, very hard,” Sadorus said. “As demonized as we were, I hope people remember that we are people, too.”",

    "source": "Japanese Drug Maker to Pay $1.1 Billion for U.S. Rival <eos> TOKYO — Shionogi & Company, the Japanese drug maker, plans to buy an American rival, Sciele Pharma for $1.1 billion, the fourth big overseas deals in nine months by a Japanese company eager to expand overseas. The bid, which follows acquisitions by Takeda Pharmaceutical, Daiichi Sankyo and the Eisai Company is aimed at building Shionogi’s sales network in the United States. “As we have moved ahead on improving our product pipeline, we have been faced with increasingly imminent challenge of getting a hold of a sales network in the world’s largest market,” the president of Shionogi, Isao Teshirogi, said Monday. Sciele should also help Shionogi in gaining approvals for new drugs from American regulators. For Sciele Pharma, which specializes in branded prescription products focused on cardiovascular, diabetes, women’s health and pediatrics, the deal comes as it faces a possible plunge in revenue because of generic competition for its No. 1 drug. Shionogi said it would offer $31 a share, a 61 percent premium to Sciele’s close of $19.27 on Friday, costing $1.1 billion. Shionogi’s total bill comes to $1.42 billion including $325 million to redeem senior convertible notes. The bidder said it would probably finance the purchase with 47 billion yen in cash and 110 billion yen in bridge loans. Shares of Shionogi, whose mainstay business is antibiotics, closed down 0.6 percent, at 2,460 yen ahead of the announcement. Eager to expand globally, Japanese pharmaceutical makers have been putting money made on top-selling drugs into acquisitions. Takeda, Japan’s largest drug maker, bought the American biotechnology firm Millennium Pharmaceuticals in April for more than $8 billion. In June, Daiichi Sankyo bid up to $4.6 billion for control of India’s Ranbaxy Laboratories, while Eisai snapped up cancer specialist MGI Pharma in December for $3.9 billion. The deal is also the latest in a string of overseas acquisitions by financially sound Japanese companies hunting for opportunities outside their home market. Already this year, announced outbound acquisitions from Japan total $42 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data, nearly double the figure for all of 2007. Sciele is rushing to promote newly approved forms of its blood-pressure drug, Sular, after ending sales of the older version earlier this month. The move could counter potential competition from low-cost generic versions of older Sular.",

    "source": "After Winning Title, West Indies Calls Out Its Cricket Board <eos> West Indies stands atop the cricket world after its double triumph in the World Twenty20, when it became the first country to win the men’s and women’s titles in the same championship. But even as its players celebrated Sunday, there were reminders of the tensions that made their triumph a surprise. There was genuine joy as both the men’s and women’s teams danced on the field in Kolkata, India, after the presentation of the men’s trophy. But there was also open anger from the West Indies men’s captain, Darren Sammy, who used the platform of a live television interview to express his grievances with the West Indies Cricket Board. “I really want to thank the heads of Caricom — throughout the tournament they have been supporting the team,” he said, referring to a flow of messages from the nations and states in the West Indies region. “And I’m yet to hear from our own cricket board. That is very disappointing.” Sammy reminded his audience that the participation of his team had been in doubt until a few weeks before the tournament started because of the latest in a long series of contractual disputes between the board and the players. At the same time, he said, the dispute had helped pull his team together. “We had a lot of issues. We felt disrespected by our board,” he said, adding a reference by the former England player and television commentator, Mark Nicholas, who called West Indies a “team without brains.” He continued: “All these things before the tournament just brought this team together.” His comments came less than an hour after West Indies became the first men’s team to win the World Twenty20 twice. Its victory over England had echoes of baseball’s fabled “Shot Heard Round the World,” the walk-off home run by Bobby Thomson that won the National League pennant for the New York Giants in 1951 over the Brooklyn Dodgers. This was four shots rather than one to win, but they were no less remarkable. West Indies needed 19 runs, usually considered an impossible target, from the final over to beat England, and batsman Carlos Brathwaite struck English bowler Ben Stokes over the boundaries for four consecutive sixes. Stokes was visibly devastated but was cleared of blame by his captain, Eoin Morgan, who said England’s total of 155 had been well short of what was needed and that his bowlers had done brilliantly to put England in a position where it could win. Each team’s innings followed a similar pattern, with the loss of three early wickets followed by determined comebacks. As the game went on, England looked as if it had an increasing stranglehold on West Indies, despite the resistance of Marlon Samuels, whose 85 not out is the highest ever individual score in a World Twenty20 final. But then came Brathwaite’s barrage to win it for West Indies. Samuels was named Man of the Match, while the Indian star Virat Kohli was named the tournament’s best player. The victory by the West Indies women was perhaps even more joyful for the players, as they won the title for the first time, beating the three-time defending champion Australia. “I don’t think it has sunk in yet,” West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor, the tournament’s top player, told reporters. “When we wake up in the morning, it’s going to be like, ‘Is this the real trophy?’ I will ask myself, ‘Is this real?’ When we touch down in the Caribbean, that’s when it is going to hit you.” Taylor also had a message for the West Indian cricket authorities. “We have to move on from there, not just enjoy, look at it as a steppingstone. We don’t want to be stuck here. We definitely need some infrastructure, like in England and Australia.” Australia had looked set for an unbeatable total when its captain, Meg Lanning, and Elyse Villani played hard-hitting innings of 52, but it lost the momentum when Deandra Dottin held Australia to a single run in its final over and its total to just below 150. Taylor and Hayley Matthews — at 18 the youngest woman to play in a World Twenty20 final — started slowly but soon caught up. They scored 120 before Matthews was dismissed for 66. Taylor fell for 59 just before the final runs were scored on a wild throw by an Australian fielder. It was a slightly anticlimactic end, but none of the West Indian players and coaches who surged onto the field — or the men’s squad, who joined the celebrations before heading to the locker room before their own match — complained about the result. There is plenty, as Sammy’s comments show, to put right in West Indian cricket, but its happiest day in 20 years was not a bad place to start.",

    "source": "Merkel Feels Political Pressure in Germany as Europe Is in Flux <eos> BERLIN — A year after Chancellor Angela Merkel threw open the doors to hundreds of thousands of migrants, that fateful move is haunting her politically, opening her to a strong electoral challenge from the far right this weekend and complicating efforts to forge a united response to Britain’s decision to leave the European Union . Ms. Merkel, chancellor since fall 2005 and Europe’s longest serving leader, has found herself on the defensive in a round of interviews on both the anniversary of the refugee influx and the effective start of campaigning for next year’s national elections. “Germany will remain Germany, with all that is dear to us,” she insisted in an interview this week with the Süddeutsche Zeitung, a leading newspaper. With everything in flux in Europe after the stunning British vote to exit the European Union, and elections also in France and the Netherlands next year, Ms. Merkel has come under increasing fire at home. Her approval rating in a widely regarded monthly poll for the public broadcaster ARD slipped to 47 percent in August, compared with 75 percent in April 2015, before the refugee challenge. If national elections were held now, her conservative bloc would get 33 percent of the vote, according to a Forsa Institute poll of 2,503 selected respondents published on Wednesday. That compares with just over 41 percent in the last national vote in 2013. An early indication of the political troubles ahead could arrive on Sunday, when the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has risen largely on popular fears of the mostly Muslim newcomers, threatens to overtake Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union in elections in her political home state. Such an outcome would be a stinging rebuke of her migrant policies. Opinion polls show the two parties neck and neck, hovering just over 20 percent in a statistical dead heat in the state, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, one of Germany’s poorest regions in the former East. “The failed policy of the chancellor is a stroke of luck for our party,” said Alexander Gauland, a leader of Alternative for Germany. “It drives voters towards us.” Image Protesters in Berlin called for Ms. Merkel’s ouster in July. Credit Axel Schmidt/Reuters By opening Germany’s borders to all last year without consulting even one member of Parliament, he added, Ms. Merkel behaved like a dictator. “It is regarded by just about every European leader as an act of madness,” he said. In tacit acknowledgment of critics who say she consulted nobody on the refugee move, Ms. Merkel has embarked on a listening tour of Europe to try to repair relations. In Tallinn, the Estonian prime minister effusively thanked her for her leadership. But it was plain in Warsaw, where she met the four Central European leaders who have flatly refused to take in refugees, that she was not among friends. A host of other demands — from Italy and France for looser purse strings, from Scandinavian and Dutch leaders to beware of fading support for Europe in their countries — are tugging at Ms. Merkel as she and President François Hollande of France consult the Continent’s leaders. They will succeed, at least on paper, in sketching some grand goals for Europe to be announced at a meeting of 27 nations — all of the bloc’s members save Britain — in mid-September. But no one has so far explained how Europe is likely this time, for example, to reduce youth unemployment, a goal voiced for years and reiterated since Britain voted on June 23 to leave the union. Missing goals again is not likely to enhance Europeans’ faith in the bloc. “The chief concern should be for the attractiveness of the union,” said Guntram B. Wolff, director of the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. Security, both internal and external, may be one area of action after terrorist attacks in Belgium , France and Germany this year. The French and German interior ministers have announced enhanced security measures that are likely to be adopted across the Continent. With Britain, one of Europe’s two nuclear powers, looking for the exit, it is no longer in a position to hamper moves toward what France, Germany and Poland defined this week as “a European civil and military planning and command capacity.” That will also require “development of a strong and competitive defense economy in Europe,” the foreign ministers of the three countries declared. Even Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary and Ms. Merkel’s most implacable opponent on refugees, seems to agree. In Warsaw, he bluntly said that Europe had failed to master economic challenges and that “we have no answers to the migrant crisis.” But, he added, “security takes first place.” “We want to build up a shared European army, common European forces,” he continued. How far any such plans progress is as uncertain as Ms. Merkel’s political future. Analysts and politicians across the board see no serious challenger to Ms. Merkel, who has coyly said only that she will announce “at the given time” whether she will seek a fourth term next year. Jacqueline Boysen wrote a 2001 biography of Ms. Merkel, whom she got to know in the 1990s in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the chancellor has her parliamentary constituency. She doubted that Ms. Merkel would leave her giant refugee task half-finished, or her party in the lurch, by declining to run. “It would be unlike her to leave the party in a mess,” said Ms. Boysen, now a journalist in Berlin. “She is very much aware of duty.” She also emphasized that Ms. Merkel, a trained physicist who entered politics only as Germany unified in 1990, had constantly been underestimated. “She was not taken seriously,” Ms. Boysen recalled in an interview. “The subtext was always, ‘She can’t do it.’ ” In defense of her decision last year, Ms. Merkel trumpets her success in forging a European Union pact with Turkey to stanch the flow of refugees into the Balkans. But Turkey has proved a difficult partner, purging thousands of judges, teachers, journalists and human rights campaigners after a failed coup in July . Still, in an interview with ARD this week, Ms. Merkel could not resist a little smile as she noted that NATO began a mission to save refugees in the Aegean in just five days in the spring, and that the pact with Turkey was negotiated within months. “Many people said, ‘We can’t do this,’ and then it got done,” she said.",

    "source": "Longstanding Obama Adviser Gets Senior Role at the White House <eos> Nearly two decades ago, Valerie Jarrett hired a young lawyer named Michelle Obama for a job at City Hall in Chicago. Now President-elect Barack Obama is hiring Ms. Jarrett for a senior role in the White House. Ms. Jarrett’s role and title are threefold: White House senior adviser and assistant to the president for intergovernmental relations and public liaison. A longstanding member of his tiny core of top advisers, Ms. Jarrett will continue providing him with counsel on a wide-ranging set of issues, she said Friday evening. She will help Mr. Obama manage his relationship with the rest of government, serving as the White House’s point person for state and local officials. Finally, she will supervise the Office of Public Liaison, which she hopes to turn into an active channel for government-citizen collaboration. “The level of the engagement in the campaign was tremendous, and we want people to understand this will be their White House,” she said in an interview. Mr. Obama “was so committed to a grass-roots campaign and wanted to keep that energy galvanized in a positive direction,” she continued, explaining his thinking for the Public Liaison role. Ms. Jarrett is a lawyer who rose to the top of Chicago city government under the tutelage of Mayor Richard M. Daley, serving as his planning commissioner, and then as chairman of the Chicago Transit Authority. In 1995, Ms. Jarrett joined the Habitat Company, a Chicago real estate company that develops and runs real estate projects from luxury high rises to public housing units; she is now the company’s chief executive. When Mr. Obama began his political career, he was a relative newcomer to Chicago, and Ms. Jarrett, whose roots there run deep, served as tutor and emissary, introducing him to many of the wealthy businesspeople whose donations seeded his rise. In his presidential campaign, Ms. Jarrett gave personal counsel to both Obamas, consulting on major decisions, and acting as diplomat to the outside world. Her White House role reflects her specialty in managing relationships. In particular, Ms. Jarrett soothed the fears of the African-American community, nervous about the first black presidential nominee of a major party, and helped broker peace with supporters of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. Shortly after his victory, Mr. Obama named Ms. Jarrett as one of three co-leaders of his transition team . Ms. Jarrett will be a historically rare sight in the White House: a high-ranking official who is African-American and female. But friends and Obama advisers say she is far more than an old chum of Mr. Obama’s or an ambassador to the black community: she is an expert in housing, transportation and health care, and a specialist in negotiation and conflict resolution. A petite, soft-spoken woman, she shares Mr. Obama’s calm, deliberative style, and is widely described as one of the few people who can speak for the president-elect with accuracy and authority. Ms. Jarrett turned 52 years old on Friday. “My birthday present from the president-elect,” she joked that evening.",

    "source": "Avocados Imperil Monarch Butterflies’ Winter Home in Mexico <eos> APÚTZIO DE JUÁREZ, Mexico — The green volcanic hills that tower above Apútzio de Juárez have begun to fill with swarms of monarch butterflies, which return each year for the winter stretch of their celebrated — and imperiled — migration. But downhill from the monarchs’ mountain roost, in the oak and pine forests that border this small farming town, there lurks a new threat to their winter habitat: a lust to grow the lucrative avocados that are being consumed at record rates in the United States. Spurred by soaring demand for the creamy fruit, farmers here in the western state of Michoacán are clearing land to make room for avocado orchards, cutting oak and pine trees that form a vital buffer around the mountain forests where the monarchs nest. “It’s scandalous what people are doing now to grow avocado,” said Arturo Espinosa Maceda, who has for years grown avocados, peaches and strelizia flowers at a farm some 12 miles north of Apútzio. “But it’s mega-business.” Apútzio sits on the western edge of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, a 135,000-acre protected area where the butterflies rest on oyamel, or native fir, trees. The butterflies’ numbers have dwindled sharply in recent years, as milkweed declined in the United States and deforestation affected their Mexican habitat. Each year environmentalists hold their breath to see how many butterflies will arrive in Mexico. Image Avocado trees in Zitácuaro, in the state of Michoacan. The state doubled its avocado exports over the past seven years to 770,000 tons — worth roughly $1.5 billion. Credit Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times Omar Vidal, director general of the World Wildlife Fund in Mexico, said that conserving the winter sanctuary was “fundamental to the survival of the migration.” Deforestation “has to be reduced to zero,” he said. But the avocado boom could complicate that goal. Americans ate a record seven pounds of avocado per capita in 2015, twice as much as in 2008, according to the Department of Agriculture. Nearly 80 percent of those avocados came from Michoacán, the only Mexican state authorized to export the fruit to the United States by the department, which bans avocados from other Mexican regions over fear of pests. Michoacán doubled its avocado exports over the last seven years to 770,000 tons — worth roughly $1.5 billion. The bonanza has been brutal for Michoacán’s oak and pine forests, which grow at 5,000 to 7,000 feet — the same altitude as avocados. Between 1974 and 2011, about 110,000 acres of forest across Michoacán’s central highlands were turned into avocado orchards, according to a study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico. And deforestation is accelerating, experts said. Jaime Navía, president of GIRA, a nonprofit organization based in Michoacán that promotes sustainable rural development, estimated that 65,000 acres — most of it forest — had been converted to avocado growing since that study. “The damage is irreversible,” he said. Officials have blamed producers looking for a pretext to turn land over to avocado orchards for a spike in the number of forest fires in Michoacán this year. But forestry experts and farmers said that Mexico’s environmental watchdog, the Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection, often turned a blind eye to abuses. Officials are fearful of powerful interests, they said, especially given that organized crime has links to the industry, or bribes make the officials pliant. Image Cutting leaves from avocado trees in an orchard in Zitácuaro. Workers make about $7.50 per day to tend the orchards, and twice that during harvests. Credit Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times “The authorities need to control this,” said Armando López Orduña, general director of the Mexican Avocado Producers and Packer-Exporters Association. To offset deforestation, the association has planted a half-million trees since 2009 and hopes to plant another half-million by 2018, he said. Around Apútzio de Juarez, a town of 1,100 people surrounded by fields of guava and corn, scars on the hillsides and patches of young avocado trees signal the crop’s advance. Some here have farmed avocado for decades. But now, growers from other areas are buying land. Davíd Romero Hernández, a stocky farmer who was trimming grass in his new avocado orchard on the edge of Apútzio one morning in October, said that the land had been covered with oak and pine. But the owner felled the trees a year ago and sold it to him. Mr. Romero, 51, pointed to a shorn hill above his plot. That, too, was also covered in forest until a few months ago, he said. Then a farmer from another village bought it. Image Land cleared for avocado growth in Apútzio. Deforestation is accelerating in the state, experts say. Credit Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times “It’s the ambition of avocado,” he said. That ambition could soon increase. Zitácuaro, the municipality surrounding Apútzio, is in the process of seeking certification to export avocados to the United States — a fact that is on the lips of every farmer. Certification is awarded municipality by municipality, and not all of Michoacán can export avocados. As it stands, some of Apútzio’s avocados are sold to buyers from Uruapan — a town 100 miles west that is the heart of the industry — who pass them off as having been grown there. Deforestation in Apútzio is a recent problem and far less extensive than in other areas of Michoacán, experts said. But “it is becoming a significant problem,” given the area’s proximity to the monarchs’ habitat, said Edgar González Godoy, director in Mexico of the New York-based Rainforest Alliance. Efforts to fight deforestation in the reserve focus on about 34,000 acres around where the butterflies roost. Programs run by the World Wildlife Fund and other organizations have helped cut logging from hundreds of acres each year to just 28 so far this year, said the fund’s Mr. Vidal. But the trees in the reserve’s outer ring play an important role, said Manuel Sarmiento, a biologist and member of the Alliance for the Conservation of Forests, Land and Water, a group of local farmers, environmental activists and residents. Image Apútzio de Juárez, a town of 1,100, gets its water from springs fed by the hills east of town. Pine and oak help water filter through the earth and into the spring; avocado, on the other hand, has shallow roots and consumes a lot of that water. Credit Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times For example, the trees cool the air from Michoacán’s warm western plains as it rises toward the oyamel forests in the center. If the temperature at the heart of the reserve, about seven miles from Apútzio, were to rise, the oyamel could suffer, and thus the butterflies would suffer, too, he said. Mr. González worries that the lure of avocado will only grow if Mexico succeeds in opening new markets. He noted that deforestation is growing in Jalisco State, another area that hopes it will soon be able to export its crop to the United States. “Just imagine what would happen if the Chinese started eating avocado,” he said. In town, residents said avocado had put money into empty pockets. Workers make about $7.50 per day to tend the orchards, and twice that during harvests. A resident can sell an acre to an avocado farmer for about $4,300 — more than that seller would typically make in a year. “People have more to spend and that lifts us all,” said Fernando Bernal, a butcher, as he hacked slabs of pork from a loin. But like others in Apútzio, Mr. Bernal worries about water. Apútzio’s supply comes from springs fed by the hills east of town. Pine and oak help water filter through the earth and into the spring; avocado, on the other hand, has shallow roots and consumes a lot of that water. If people keep cutting down the forest, “we’ll run out,” Mr. Bernal said. And Apútzio isn’t the only community with much at stake. The hills that stretch north east of here collect water for the massive Cutzamala water system that supplies the thirsty Mexican capital, Mexico City, 100 miles away. Even Mr. Romero, happily tending his avocado bushes on land once filled with mighty trees, is saddened by the loss of forest. He said that his village, Zicata de Morelos, depends on water that comes from the hills near Apútzio. “So we’re all affected,” Mr. Romero said. “But people don’t think about the future.”",

Pirro is separating from her husband, a family spokesman said yesterday. The split comes a year after Ms. Pirro lost her bid to become state attorney general, in a campaign that was hounded by personal concerns as the couple’s marriage troubles made headlines and Ms. Pirro acknowledged that she was under federal investigation for plotting to record her husband, Albert J. Pirro , to catch him in a suspected affair. “We have agreed to amicably separate,” the couple, who have been married for more than three decades, said in a statement released by the spokesman, Michael McKeon. “As always, our priority remains our two wonderful children. We ask that people respect our privacy,” said the couple, who declined to comment further. Ms. Pirro, a Republican, ran for the United States Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but abandoned the bid after failing to attract much attention or money in four months. On the first day of that campaign, she was left stumbling for words for 32 seconds when a page of her announcement speech was missing. As Ms. Pirro, a former Westchester County district attorney, turned her attention to the attorney general seat, she repeatedly fielded questions about her husband, a lawyer, lobbyist and Republican fund-raiser. He served a federal prison sentence for tax fraud and admitted that while he was married to Ms. Pirro, he fathered a child with another woman. In a New York magazine article last year, Mr. Pirro denied having a new affair, but said he sought the company of other women because he felt he was not getting enough attention from his wife, who once made People magazine’s Most Beautiful People list. “You need to have someone tell you that you’re smart or you’re good-looking or you made a good business decision,” he told the magazine. “Do I think that I would like to have more attention at home? Yeah, and, you know, if you’re not going to get attention at home, I think you really need to make some decisions about your future.” He said he believed his wife’s political career had hurt him financially and legally. Jeanine Pirro told the magazine she had no plans to seek a divorce, insisting she had loved her husband from the day they met. Albert Pirro, however, did not rule out a split. Mr. Pirro was reinstated as a lawyer in January, more than six years after he was disbarred for a tax fraud conviction. By February, the pair had put their homes in Harrison, N.Y., and Florida up for sale for a total of more than $5 million, according to Internet property listings at the time.",

    "source": "With ‘High Maintenance,’ Vimeo Invests in Original Content <eos> “ High Maintenance ,” a web series on Vimeo about the many customers of a Brooklyn marijuana dealer, has won a devoted following and plenty of critical acclaim. Each of its first 13 episodes has been watched hundreds of thousands of times. The New Yorker raved that the show, “freed of the constraints” of formulas imposed by television schedules, radiates “new ideas about storytelling.” But will viewers pay to watch it? Vimeo, the video-sharing web service owned by IAC, will release three new episodes of “High Maintenance” on Tuesday. The new episodes — each less than 20 minutes long — are $2 apiece, or $8 for a set that includes three more that will be released in January. This is the first time that Vimeo has funded the series directly, and represents the company’s first push into original content, following a recent trend among larger digital companies such as Yahoo, Netflix and Amazon. While Vimeo’s chief executive, Kerry Trainor, is betting that viewers will pay up, he says his ambitions go beyond generating a new source of revenue. He sees “High Maintenance” as the perfect show to be a foundation for a prestige television brand, and compares his site’s developing identity to that of premium cable in the 1970s, an analogy in which YouTube plays advertising-powered network television to Vimeo’s HBO. “We really feel like Vimeo is in the world to find a higher-quality creator, delivering a different experience than what you’d typically find on YouTube,” Mr. Trainor said. “Not to say that YouTube is bad, but Vimeo on the whole has much more of a premium cable and even a film sensibility. That’s what tends to do well on the platform.” Vimeo’s website is built to appeal to fans who favor the work of auteurs. The language of its on-demand platform promotes the people behind the films almost as vociferously as the projects themselves. One prominent button, indicated by a smiley face, exhorts users to “support creativity,” explaining that “most of the cash goes to the maker.” The push into original programming is one of several developments intended to reshape Vimeo’s revenue model. The service, which had 33 percent growth in both unique users and subscribers this quarter, recently announced that it would introduce a viewer subscription service next year. (Current subscribers pay for the right to use the production tools offered on Vimeo Plus and Vimeo Pro .) The site’s on-demand platform, introduced in March 2013, has almost 14,000 titles available for purchase, and its gross revenue has nearly doubled since last quarter. Jessica Casano-Antonellis, Vimeo’s director of communications, compared the on-demand portion of the site to iTunes “in that Vimeo is an open platform” where “anyone can upload and sell content directly.” Image Ben Sinclair, left, and Avery Monsen in the web series \"High Maintenance.\" Credit Janky Clown Productions For the creators of “High Maintenance,” the biggest fear may be that the show’s audience will not be willing to pay for what they used to get free. “The psychology behind it is what’s become interesting to us,” said Katja Blichfeld, who writes and directs the show with her husband, Ben Sinclair. “We haven’t experienced pushback yet, but there have been murmurings of people complaining about having to pay now.” For Ms. Blichfeld and Mr. Sinclair, the partnership with Vimeo is an experiment that could help pioneer a way for short-form independent filmmakers to make money from their work. “You don’t have to have some goliath managing your content and distributing it for you,” Mr. Sinclair said. “You can get rid of all those middlemen and just get a direct conversation between the artist and the audience.” Apart from helping write, direct and edit the show, Mr. Sinclair plays the marijuana dealer. For the most part, his presence is the only element that links individual episodes; otherwise, each focuses on a separate set of characters and tells a stand-alone story. Episodes can vary sharply in tone. The short, comedic “Olivia” tells the story of two thieving gossips who come across as some of the very worst people in New York; a more meditative episode called “Brad Pitts” is a window into the life of a woman with stomach cancer. On the show, drugs are rarely glamorized or used as a form of cheap titillation; Cheech and Chong this is not. Ms. Blichfeld and Mr. Sinclair have each used marijuana for “10 years plus,” and their comfort with the drug is reflected in their characters. Mr. Sinclair’s character, known simply as “the guy,” is not, for most viewers, a scuzzy criminal, but rather a humane, if somewhat dopey, evolution of the bartender — a 21st-century version of Sam Malone from “Cheers.” Though its creators insist that nothing about their approach has changed with the Vimeo partnership (other than their ability to finally pay collaborators what they deserve), faithful viewers will note an increased sophistication in the new episodes. At its core though, the show remains the same. At a screening last week, a fan asked Mr. Sinclair what he and Ms. Blichfeld had been doing with “all that Vimeo money.” “It’s what we’ve been doing, plus,” Mr. Sinclair replied. “It’s not a new thing. And it’s been very comforting to be at Vimeo for that.”",

    "source": "Lugar Loses Primary Challenge in Indiana <eos> INDIANAPOLIS — Richard G. Lugar , one of the Senate’s longest-serving members, a collegial moderate who personified a gentler political era, was turned out of office on Tuesday, ending a career that had spanned the terms of half a dozen presidents. Mr. Lugar, a six-term senator from Indiana who had won most of his recent elections with more than 60 percent of the vote, only received 39.4 percent of the vote on Tuesday, losing a hard-fought Republican primary to Richard E. Mourdock, the state treasurer. Mr. Mourdock’s campaign was fueled by Tea Party groups and national conservative organizations that deemed Mr. Lugar too willing to compromise and poured millions of dollars into the campaign to defeat him. Mr. Lugar, 80, had not faced a challenge from within his own party since his first election to the Senate in 1976, and his defeat seemed to serve as a caution to moderates on both sides of the aisle. In February, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, a moderate Republican, decided not to run for re-election, citing polarization in Washington. Senators Kent Conrad of North Dakota, a Democratic fiscal centrist, and Jim Webb of Virginia, a moderate Democrat, are retiring. Two other moderate Democrats, Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Jon Tester of Montana, face tough re-election races. Tea Party organizers and conservative leaders held the Indiana outcome as evidence of a broader national demand for Republicans with unshakable stances on fiscal reform and conservative values, as well as proof of the continuing power of the Tea Party movement. “Richard Mourdock’s victory truly sends a message to the liberals in the Republican Party ,“ said Chris Chocola, president of the Club for Growth. “Voters are rejecting the policies that led to record debt and diminished economic freedom.” For a number of Mr. Lugar’s supporters, the results were a sorry arc — not just for a man who has served for 35 years in Washington and as mayor of Indianapolis before that, but for a larger notion of trying to work across party lines in Washington. Prominent Democrats, including President Obama, issued statements of appreciation on Tuesday night for Mr. Lugar, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and for his work, particularly on the nation’s foreign affairs. “While Dick and I didn’t always agree on everything,” Mr. Obama said, “I found during my time in the Senate that he was often willing to reach across the aisle and get things done.” Still, some Democrats, eager to hold onto the Senate, also seemed buoyed by the results here. With Mr. Lugar’s defeat, they see the glimmer of an opportunity to claim a Senate seat that the party had considered out of reach as long as he was in the running. The Democratic candidate, Representative Joe Donnelly, is thought to have a better chance with independents and moderate Republicans in November against Mr. Mourdock. Almost immediately, Democrats began emphasizing Mr. Mourdock’s conservative views. “Hoosiers deserve real leadership that will reach across the aisle in Richard Lugar’s successor, not Richard Mourdock’s Tea Party extremism,” said Dan Parker, the chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party. For months, the campaign here had been intense, expensive and, by Indiana standards, mean. National groups including the Club for Growth, the National Rifle Association and FreedomWorks, which helped build the Tea Party movement, had viewed Mr. Lugar as a ripe and overdue target, and they poured millions of dollars into the state. Mr. Lugar — who may be best known for his 1990s effort, along with Sam Nunn, a Democratic senator from Georgia, for a disarmament program in the former Soviet Union — was criticized throughout the campaign for what critics described as his tendency to cooperate with Democrats. He shifted to the right in 2011, after the threat to his re-election became clear. Mr. Mourdock, meanwhile, has said that bipartisanship has led the nation to the brink of bankruptcy, and that the nation’s current circumstances call for a time of confrontation, not collegiality. After his victory, he acknowledged his opponent. “I know what it’s like to lose — it’s not fun,” Mr. Mourdock told The Associated Press. “And especially after he’s given that 36 years in the Senate. I know he has to feel terrible tonight, and I truly feel badly for him.” Some of Mr. Lugar’s critics accused him of being Mr. Obama’s closest Republican friend — a claim Mr. Lugar scoffed at, but also took questions about right up until Tuesday afternoon. They also railed against positions he took at various times in favor of Mr. Obama’s Supreme Court nominees, the Dream Act, the bank bailout, the nuclear arms control treaty and more. Mr. Lugar’s supporters countered that he had maintained a conservative agenda over the years, for less government spending, a balanced-budget amendment and fewer regulations that harmed businesses. For his part, Mr. Lugar sounded unbowed on Tuesday afternoon, arguing that most Americans were fed up with partisan battling and saying his race had evolved into a “playground” for outside interest groups. If it felt peculiar to be entering an election day as an underdog — Democrats did not even field an opponent six years ago — Mr. Lugar did not show it. “This morning, I woke up after a good night’s sleep, just as before, ready with vim and vigor to make certain that we do the Lord’s fight today, and we’re going to do the best we can,” he said. But for some here, Mr. Lugar’s troubles reached beyond questions of partisan loyalty. He was required this year to change his voter registration to the farm his family has owned for years rather than the Indianapolis house he sold in 1977 — an episode that underscored how long he had been in Washington and, in the view of some, how tenuous his ties to Indiana now felt. “Everybody’s time comes,” said Ed Budd, who described himself as a Tea Party supporter and handed out Mourdock leaflets outside a polling place in Fairland on Tuesday when Mr. Lugar walked up looking, in Mr. Budd’s words, “diminished some” from the familiar image he had seen on television for so many years. Throughout the day, voters for and against Mr. Lugar confided quietly that they felt sadness and discomfort as they witnessed the unfolding scene. “This is all really painful to watch,” said Larry MacIntyre, a supporter of Mr. Lugar’s. Many in a ballroom here on Tuesday night were crying as Mr. Lugar stepped onto a stage smiling and said he hoped Mr. Mourdock would prevail in the fall. “We are experiencing deep political divisions in our society right now,” Mr. Lugar said as tears welled in the eyes of the family members lined up behind him. “These divisions have stalemated progress in critical areas. But these divisions are not insurmountable, and I believe that people of good will regardless of party can work together for the benefit of our country.”",

    "source": "Echo of the Past, Norman Storms the British Open <eos> SOUTHPORT, England — As curtain calls go, the scene unfolding amid the ancient dunes at Royal Birkdale on Friday surely would rank among the most compelling golf has seen in a long time. With a misty sheet of rain wrapped like a shroud around the northwest coast of Merseyside, a golfer given up for dead walked up the 18th fairway to a standing ovation, waving and smiling, his hat doffed to reveal the still ample and familiar shock of blond hair with a touch of gray. Greg Norman , newly wed and on his honeymoon with the tennis great Chris Evert, was in the lead in the 137th British Open. With two rounds of par 70, he had withstood the vicious combination of wind and rain that had buffeted the coast for two days and — until K. J. Choi passed him by one stroke just before nightfall — was the only golfer to win the battle against the tough, old links course. Norman will be in the final pairing with Choi on Saturday, one stroke ahead of 26-year-old Camilo Villegas, the promising Colombian player who had eight birdies, including five straight to close out his round of 65. At two-over-par 142 is a group of seven that includes the three co-leaders from the first round — Rocco Mediate , Graeme McDowell and Robert Allenby, each of whom shot 73 Friday — and the also-resurrected David Duval, the former world No. 1 who had slipped into a tie for No. 1,087. Duval shot 69. With all these subplots battling for attention, Norman, a 53-year-old who spends more time playing tennis with his wife than competitive golf, stole the spotlight. He has not won an official professional event in 10 years, but as he moved toward the 18th green with his impossibly white teeth glistening, looking slowly left and right to acknowledge the deafening cheers, there was no doubt what was happening. Here was the reappearance of the Great White Shark, swimming in ever-tightening circles around the Open, as if he and the old caddie Linn Strickler had gone through a time portal to the 1980s. “H. G. Wells,” said Strickler, his craggy face brightening into a smile. “Yeah, of course you feel like you’re stepping back in time,” said Norman, who was No. 1 for a total of 331 weeks between September 1986 and January 1998. “My expectations were almost nil coming in, to tell you the truth. I hadn’t played a lot of golf. Expectations are still realistically low, and I have to be that way, too, because I can’t sit here and say, ‘O.K., it’s great, I’m playing well and I’m doing it.’ “Well, I am playing well, I am doing it, but I still haven’t been there for a long time.” A very long time. His last real shot at a major championship was in 1996, when he went into the final round of the Masters with a six-stroke lead, shot 78, and lost by five strokes to Nick Faldo, who shot 67. There are those who remember him almost exclusively for that. He is also the only golfer to have lost a playoff in each of the four majors — the 1984 United States Open, the 1987 Masters, the 1990 British Open and the 1993 P.G.A. Championship. Others remember him for that. Larger than life, win or lose, Norman has always known how to command golf’s stage. It is not just his formidable physical presence — which Evert describes by outlining a V with her hands in the air, starting with the broad shoulders down the narrow hips. His aura also comes from movement, a walk that consumes distance with unhurried strides, a golf swing that flashes with power, even still. Whether windblown and victorious at Turnberry in ’86, or bent and broken at Augusta National in ’96, he overwhelms the occasion and owns the moment. He could do the same at Royal Birkdale, where inexplicably, and simultaneously, he has found his game and peace of mind. “My life is great,” he said. “I’ve got a wonderful wife, and my whole being that’s going on around here is just beautiful, to tell you the truth. So obviously it makes you feel more relaxed, makes you feel more comfortable about what you’re doing and where you are.” He added: “There is obviously less pressure on me than most because obviously there will be more pressure tomorrow and Sunday. But honestly, there’s probably less pressure on me than anybody out here because even though I’m in the position I am in, I’m going to go out there and just say, ‘Hey, just go have fun with it.’ ” That is a change from the full-bore, all-out-attack approach Norman once brought to his golf. But it is working so far. Norman played steadily and systematically, putted well and immediately offset a double bogey at the brutally tough sixth hole with birdies at Nos. 7 and 8, making putts of 25 and 15 feet to make the turn in one under par. He demonstrated his fitness and flexibility at the 16th hole when, unable to get a stance inside the bunker, he straddled the edge, taking a spread-legged, deep crouch position. Maintaining it throughout his swing, he popped the ball on to the putting surface 12 feet from the hole, then made the putt. Moves like that impress the youngsters. “He’s got the body of a 25-year-old and the head of a 53-year-old,” said Justin Rose, 27. “It’s not a bad combination. But it’s superb, I guess, just to find the determination to go out there and really believe he can do it, I suppose.” But is it feasible to think a 53-year-old could win a major on the regular circuit? Or is it like asking John McEnroe to get off the couch and make it into the fourth round at Wimbledon? Jack Nicklaus, on the grounds at Birkdale on Friday in a corporate role for the Royal Bank of Scotland, thought about it for a just a second. “Greg has played very little golf,” he said. “The only thing I can relate it to is when I won the Masters back in ’86. I hadn’t played any golf, I’d been playing a little bit, played a few tournaments. But I remembered how to play when I needed to down the stretch. “Maybe that’s the position he’ll find himself in come the weekend. I mean, I’m sure he’ll remember how to play and remember how to win a golf tournament, when he gets himself in position to do so — when and if. We’ve got a long way to go. Even if he doesn’t, I think that will inspire him to go and play a little bit more.”",

    "source": "Putin in Ukraine to Celebrate a Christian Anniversary <eos> MOSCOW — In an apparent attempt to use shared history to make a case for closer ties, President Vladimir V. Putin attended religious ceremonies in the Ukrainian capital on Saturday to commemorate the 1,025th anniversary of events that brought Christianity to Ukraine and Russia. At a reception in Kiev, the capital, Mr. Putin spoke of the primacy of the two countries’ spiritual and historical bonds, regardless of political decisions that often divide them. Relations have been rocky in part because of attempts by Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, to formalize its political and economic ties with the European Union. “We are all spiritual heirs of what happened here 1,025 years ago,” Mr. Putin told church hierarchs at the Monastery of the Caves in Kiev, one of the holiest sites of Orthodoxy, according to the RIA Novosti news agency. “And in this sense we are, without a doubt, one people.” Mr. Putin’s trip was also the latest sign of the deepening ties and common agenda of the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church. The events last week commemorated Prince Vladimir of Kiev’s decision to convert to Christianity and baptize his subjects in 988, an event known as the Baptism of Rus, the founding of the Russian Orthodox Church, whose adherents include those beyond Russia’s modern borders. The anniversary has been the subject of lavish political and news media attention in Russia, where Saturday’s events were broadcast, reflecting the Kremlin’s embrace of the church and its spiritual leader, Patriarch Kirill I. The attention has also lent apparent endorsement to church criticism of Western democracy and secular culture, particularly homosexuality. The patriarch presided over prayers on Saturday after arriving in Kiev on Friday accompanied by representatives of all of the world’s Orthodox churches and bearing fragments of a cross on which the Apostle Andrew is believed to have been crucified. On Thursday, Patriarch Kirill and the other church leaders met with Mr. Putin in the Kremlin, where they discussed the fate of Christians in the Middle East. The cross, on loan from Patras, Greece, has already been venerated by hundreds of thousands on a tour across Russia sponsored by Vladimir Yakunin, the powerful head of the Russian Railways, who is close to Mr. Putin and the church. Patriarch Kirill invoked the concept of the Holy Rus, referring to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus as a unified spiritual expanse united under the faith. Ukraine’s religious landscape has been divided for centuries, not least after the collapse of the Soviet Union, by tensions over allegiance to Moscow. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate is one of the largest parts of the Russian Orthodox Church, but other groups in Ukraine planned their own commemorations. Image President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia with Patriarch Kirill I of the Russian Orthodox Church in Kiev, Ukraine, on Saturday. Credit Sergei Chuzavkov/Associated Press The patriarch has sought to unify the faithful with warnings of the encroachment of secular values. He recently warned that legislative efforts to legalize same-sex marriage in Europe posed a grave threat to Russia. “This is a very dangerous apocalyptic symptom, and we must do everything so that sin is never validated by the laws of the state in the lands of Holy Rus, because this would mean that the people are starting on the path of self-destruction,” he said at a Moscow cathedral, according to the Web site of the Moscow Patriarchate. He previously said that such “blasphemous laws” could prove as dangerous to believers as the executioners of the Great Terror during the government of Stalin. The church’s views have increasing resonance in the political debate in Russia, where Parliament adopted laws in June banning “gay propaganda” and the adoption of children by foreign same-sex couples. In a film called “The Second Baptism of Rus,” shown recently on Russian state television, Mr. Putin credited Prince Vladimir’s choice of religion with “building a centralized Russian state,” something he sees as a cornerstone of his leadership. Mr. Putin recalled the story of his mother having him baptized in secret after his birth in 1952 because of Soviet repression of the church. He described Communism as “just a simplified version of the religious principles shared by practically all the world’s traditional religions” and said that today’s turn to religion was “a spontaneous movement from the people themselves to turn back to their roots” in response to the ideological vacuum after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Ukraine’s president, Viktor F. Yanukovich, appeared beside Mr. Putin during the service on Saturday, though relations between Moscow and Kiev have continued to be marred by battles over gas pipelines and other disputes despite a widely held view in Russia that Mr. Yanukovich would be more solidly aligned with Russia. Ukraine is scheduled to sign an association agreement with the European Union in November. While insisting that choices of international relations were Ukraine’s to make, Mr. Putin argued Saturday that Ukraine would fare better by deepening its political and economic ties with Russia. On Saturday, Femen , the Ukrainian feminist group known for its bare-breasted protests, said three of its activists and a photojournalist were beaten and taken away by an “organized group of people” on the way to a protest of the celebrations. On its Web site, Femen accused the spy agencies of Ukraine and Russia of being behind the attack, though it did not provide evidence. The Kiev police said they had detained three women for “petty hooliganism” after they refused to cover up when they were spotted naked on the street. The police Web site said a photographer who was accompanying them was detained for disobeying police orders. It did not talk about beatings. Femen later reported that its leader, Anna Hutsol, was beaten up while in a cafe on Saturday night and her laptop was taken.",

    "source": "Pushing for Livability Amid Downtown’s Chaos <eos> Sure, urban lobbyists are made, not born. But if the force field emanating from Elizabeth H. Berger, the excitable, fancifully attired (she swears by quirky designer finds from her neighbor, the Century 21 store) new president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, is a reliable signifier, once a lobbyist, always a lobbyist. “Lobbying is about giving voice to the people,” she says. “You can do it with integrity, or you can do it without integrity, but I’m proud of my list.” At the top of the list is the New York Dance and Performance “Bessie” Award she got in 2004 for her contribution to government arts advocacy: “I think I’m the first lobbyist to win a Bessie.” Now as the new head of the alliance, a government-regulated nonprofit agency that manages the largest business improvement district in the nation and promotes the financial district as a world-class destination, she foresees a unique convergence of business, commerce, and culture despite the continuing construction chaos. “Our philosophy,” she says, “is that the best way to support business is through building a 24/7 community.” She should know: she lives there. Ms. Berger, 47, has lobbied for a livelier, round-the-clock vibe — grocery stores headed her wish list — in the financial district since arriving in 1982. In high school she moved with her family to Providence, R.I., where she won a Congressional internship and met her first political hero, the flamboyant revisionist mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr., who later went to prison for corruption. After graduating from Yale, where she fashioned her own urban studies major, Ms. Berger joined the cadre of urban residential pioneers here. “I can remember having to take an R train to Bay Ridge if you wanted to buy underwear on a weekend, because back then Century 21 wasn’t open on weekends,” she says. “I remember when we got our first all-night greengrocer; it was 1986!” Why would a woman who grew up on Gramercy Park want to live so far downtown? She needed to be able to walk to City Hall, where she started out as a New York City Urban Fellow and mayoral aide to Edward I. Koch. She ultimately served as assistant mayoral representative (his lobbyist) before the City Council. She still walks to work. And she can still twist arms, ostensibly in the direction of checkbooks, simply by moving her lips. Just ask the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which recently forked over the $1.5 million grant that is bankrolling the first phase of “Re:Construction,” a counterintuitive collaboration between the alliance and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council that recasts downtown construction sites as public canvases for innovative art and architecture. “This is a program that makes a silk purse out of a sow’s ear,” Ms. Berger asserts, tongue in cheek, in regard to the three projects — “Best Pedestrian Route” on John Street, “Fulton Fence,” and “Concrete Jungle” on Broadway between Ann and John Streets — that have successfully applied a dose of colorful camouflage to concrete barricades and other eyesores. She anticipates that 60 public sites and 20 privately owned sites will participate. “I don’t see it as decorating the mess that is downtown during rebuilding; it’s more that we’re naming it and owning it in the interim,” she says, speaking like the daughter of a psychotherapist (her mother has a practice in Rhode Island) and an artist (her father also ran nonprofit community agencies). Think of it as an intervention in the midst of an urban renewal. “So much of what we’ve done downtown since 9/11 has been aimed at making a bad thing less bad, but this is an effort to put some whimsy and cheer back into the daily lives of the 350,000 people who live and work here,” says Ms. Berger, who lives near ground zero with her husband, Frederick Kaufman, a writer and CUNY journalism professor, and their two young children. HER family was displaced for four months after 9/11, but not returning to their apartment was never an option. “It’s almost like when people renew their marriage vows,” she says of her devotion to downtown. “Make daily life better now, that’s my first goal at the alliance. Goal two, figure out how to continue to attract and retain businesses. Goal three is the vision thing: when there are no more potential canvases for reconstruction, what do we want Lower Manhattan to look like and be like? I’m here for the duration.” Ms. Berger left city government for law school at the University of Southern California, but lasted just 11 weeks. She returned to New York City, acquired a mentor in Gordon Davis, a lawyer who served as parks commissioner during the Koch administration, and created a niche for herself as a government relations adviser for several law firms. And she performed her civic duty: She served on Community Boards 1 and 5, was a member of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation’s residents’ advisory council, and joined the board of the alliance in 1998. Persuasion is an art she mastered early on. And then there’s that politically indispensable quality she so admired in Mr. Cianci and Mr. Koch and admires in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg: the vision thing. She’s got it, too. By age 7, she had decided that rather than pursuing her original ambition of becoming the first woman to be president of the United States, it made sense to set her sights on becoming the president of United States Steel. This did not, Ms. Berger notes with the benefit of 40 years of hindsight, make her an eccentric child: “I’d just call it a 7-year-old’s exploration of where the power was.”",

    "source": "With Cameras Rolling, Knicks Keep the Ball Moving <eos> GREENBURGH, N.Y. — The Knicks let cameras into their training center Tuesday, and for fans and members of the news media, it was an opportunity to see Coach Mike Woodson direct his team through a full practice (most N.B.A. teams allow the news media to see the last 30 minutes of practice). MSG televised the event live, which it has done the past three years. Woodson’s focus was on ball movement. He pointed to different areas on the floor while his players watched and listened. He instructed them on how to come off screens at the top of the paint and how to feed the ball into the post from a number of different spots on the court. Then the Knicks went in motion, passing the ball several times before putting up a shot. “That’s going to be the key to our success,” Woodson said. “We have to be able to move the basketball. I’m anxious to see if they pick it up and carry it into a game. Good teams are not going to allow you to play on one side of the floor.” The Knicks were criticized last season for allowing the ball to stop in the halfcourt. Woodson, who ran a number of isolation sets for Carmelo Anthony and others, plans to have the team run more pick-and-rolls and get the ball inside. Anthony seemed more interested in passing rather than shooting Tuesday. While he took some shots in transition, he made sure to get the ball into Amar’e Stoudemire’s hands in the post. Stoudemire worked to improve his scoring in the low post this summer by training with the Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon. “He’s getting better at that each day,” Anthony said of Stoudemire. “We’re trying our best right now to get the ball to him down there so he can get comfortable. That’s the most important thing, because if you’re not comfortable down there, it’s not going to work.” Stoudemire showed patience and strength in the post. He used spin moves to his left and his right to score over Chris Copeland and Henry Sims. He also scored with hook shots from the middle of the paint. “Amar’e is a player that should be able to post the ball some,” Woodson said. “I’m just trying to mix it up a little for him so that he’s not just picking and popping out for a shot all the time.” Woodson said he had not decided who would start at shooting guard. Iman Shumpert and Ronnie Brewer, who both are rehabilitating from knee surgery, were doing individual workouts Tuesday. James White, who had been practicing with the starting unit, was on the sideline with a sore right hamstring that could keep him out of Thursday’s preseason opener at Washington. Woodson kept J. R. Smith in his usual role of playing with the second team. Last week, Smith said he wanted to be a starter and that he entered camp hoping to accomplish that goal. “Everybody can’t start,” Woodson said. “I have to have some offense coming off the bench, and I told J. R. he could be the best player coming off the bench in this league.” REBOUNDS Chris Smith missed his third straight practice with a sore left knee. ... Marcus Camby did not practice because of a strained left calf. ... Rasheed Wallace participated in the Knicks’ early walk-through, but continued to work on his conditioning when the team scrimmaged. Wallace said he felt good about his cross-training workouts and that he did not know when he would join the team for a full practice. “It’s not up to me; it’s up to Coach Woodson,” Wallace said. “I’m not one to complain. If it’s not until mid-November, it’s mid-November. I can’t control that, I just have to be ready either way.”",

    "source": "Israel, Facing Criticism, to Investigate Possible Military Misconduct in Gaza <eos> TEL AVIV — Israel on Wednesday announced it had begun criminal investigations into five instances of possible military misconduct in the 50-day Gaza war, an implicit acknowledgment of sensitivity to the widespread criticism, even among allies like the United States, that Israeli forces had used excessive firepower in a number of highly publicized assaults in the Palestinian territory. The announcement, conveyed at a briefing by the Israeli military, came only two weeks after a cease-fire in the conflict, an unusually speedy response. But critics, including human rights advocates in Israel, said it remained to be seen whether the investigations would yield significant criminal indictments and punishments. Some said the timing of the inquiries appeared to be an attempt by the Israeli government to pre-empt the impact of international investigations into allegations of possible Israeli war crimes committed in Gaza. They also pointed out that the cases, opened by Israel’s Military Advocate General Corps, included obvious episodes that had already drawn condemnation. One prominent Israeli human rights group, B’Tselem, refused to participate in the investigations and said history showed that the Israeli military could not possibly conduct a credible prosecution of itself. “Based on past experience, we can only regretfully say that Israeli law enforcement authorities are unable and unwilling to investigate allegations of breaches of international humanitarian law committed during fighting in Gaza,” the organization said in a statement. “Should the existing whitewashing mechanism be replaced with an independent investigative body, we would gladly cooperate with it.” On the Ground in Israel and Gaza Two photographers captured scenes from the most recent outbreak of war. Even so, Israel’s inquiries into possible criminal misconduct by its own soldiers stood in sharp contrast to what has happened in Gaza, where Hamas, the dominant militant force, has no such judicial process and has been widely criticized for summarily executing suspected Palestinian collaborators with Israel. The most prominent of the five military cases have already been the subject of international censure: an Israeli strike that resulted in the death of 16 civilians sheltering at a United Nations school in Beit Hanoun and the killing of four boys on a Gaza beach . The three other cases, as conveyed by an Israeli military official giving the briefing, involve a Palestinian teenager, Ahmed Abu Raida, who said he was mistreated while in detention and forced to guide Israeli soldiers, with the decision to investigate largely based on the youth’s allegations as reported in The New York Times; a Palestinian woman who was shot to death after she had informed Israeli forces of her movements and received their consent; and a soldier who is alleged to have stolen money from a private home. Of 44 cases initially referred to army fact-finding teams for preliminary examination, seven have been closed, including one involving the death of eight members of a family when their home was struck on July 8, the first day of the Israeli air campaign, and others are pending. A further 55 episodes are to be referred to the fact-finding teams next week, according to a senior Israeli official, who briefed reporters at military headquarters here and spoke on the condition of anonymity under the Israeli military protocol. The swiftness of the self-investigation by the military and the publicity about it appeared partly intended to get ahead of an investigation commissioned by the United Nations Human Rights Council into allegations of possible war crimes. The Israeli government has said it will not cooperate with the United Nations mission, asserting that its mandate is biased against Israel. Image Relatives of a boy killed on July 24 in an airstrike that hit a United Nations school in Beit Hanoun grieved over his body at a hospital. Credit Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The investigation process may also be intended to counter threats by the Palestinian leadership to join the International Criminal Court for the purpose of holding Israel accountable for its actions as an occupying power. The court generally only investigates cases where the country involved is unwilling or unable to investigate itself. More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the Israeli air and ground operation, up to three-quarters of them civilians, according to the United Nations and other monitoring groups. The Israeli authorities assert that up to half the casualties were probably combatants. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed. Israel said its campaign was aimed at halting rocket fire from the Palestinian coastal territory, which is dominated by Hamas, and at destroying a network of tunnels, more than a dozen of them leading into Israeli territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has rejected criticism of its military’s self-accountability and asserted that justice and due process are built into Israel’s democratic system. He has repeatedly accused Hamas of committing a “double war crime” for indiscriminately firing thousands of rockets against Israeli towns and cities, and for operating from within heavily populated areas of Gaza, using its own civilians, in Mr. Netanyahu’s words, as a “human shield.” Still, the Israeli Army’s legal counselors have acknowledged the international scrutiny on Israel’s military behavior. They say they have become more involved in recent years in operational activity before and during military attacks on Gaza, as well as in the aftermath. The counselors have trained commanders, reviewed planned targets and deployed to the Gaza border to work with commanders at the division level during the recent conflict. Assessing the Damage and Destruction in Gaza The damage to Gaza’s infrastructure from the current conflict is already more severe than the destruction caused by either of the last two Gaza wars. The recently established military committee of fact-finding teams, independent of the military’s chain of command and made up largely of reservists, began investigating certain “exceptional” cases. Previous experience appears to have shown, in Israel’s view, the importance of speedy investigations. A Human Rights Council inquiry into the 2008-9 war in Gaza led to the Goldstone Report. Named for Richard Goldstone, the South African jurist who led that inquiry, the report found evidence of potential war crimes committed by both Israel and Hamas. It accused Israel of intentionally targeting civilians in Gaza as a matter of policy. Mr. Goldstone later sought to retract that accusation, writing in The Washington Post, after Israeli investigators presented contradictory evidence, “If I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would have been a different document.” Other members of the Goldstone panel stood by the report. An Israeli public commission that examined the mechanisms for dealing with claims of violations of the laws of armed conflict, led by a retired Supreme Court judge, concluded last year that the Israeli military’s system generally complied with international law. But it recommended expediting the process of deciding when to open criminal investigations. Some circumstances, like the mistreatment of detainees, “requires immediate examination,” the military official told reporters on Wednesday. Critics have called into question the military’s ability to investigate itself. B’Tselem and another Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din, described the military law enforcement system as “a complete failure” in a statement this week. After the 2008-9 war in Gaza, in which up to 1,400 Palestinians were killed, more than 50 cases out of 400 that were examined were referred to the military police for criminal investigation. Three investigations ended with indictments, according to the military. B’Tselem noted that the harshest sentence was given to a soldier who had stolen a credit card.",

    "source": "Pointing to a New Era, U.S. Pulls Back as Iraqis Vote <eos> BAGHDAD — Iraqis across the country voted Saturday in provincial elections that will help shape their future, but regardless of the outcome it is clear that the Americans are already drifting offstage — and that most Iraqis are ready to see them go. The signs of mutual disengagement are everywhere. In the days leading up to the elections, it was possible to drive safely from near the Turkish border in the north to Baghdad and on south to Basra, just a few miles from the Persian Gulf — without seeing an American convoy. In the Green Zone — once host to the American occupation government, and now the seat of the Iraqi government — the primary PX is set to close, and the Americans have retreated to their vast, garrisoned new embassy compound. Iraqi soldiers now handle all Green Zone checkpoints. American helicopters and drones may be in the sky, but Iraqi boots are on the ground. The Americans are already worried about securing the road to Kuwait because soon they will have to start hauling out much of the infrastructure they have built on bases across Iraq . The end of an era comes not in a single moment, but looking back it has become evident that the mood has changed, power has shifted, the world is not the same. In the United States, many Americans view the war as already over, even though more than 140,000 American soldiers remain on Iraqi soil. President Obama has made it plain that Iraq is not his war; he wants to focus on Afghanistan. In an economic crisis, there is simply not enough money for the country to keep spending hundreds of millions of dollars a day in Iraq. Any arguments that remain in Washington about the shape and timing of the troop withdrawal this year seem almost moot here, given how much Iraqis want to show they can govern on their own and how much Americans want to hand over responsibility to the Iraqis so they can meet withdrawal deadlines. This is not to suggest that the war is over. In two provinces, Nineveh and Diyala, counterinsurgency operations are still under way, and the military is tracking signs of activity by Sunni extremist groups in the troubled areas surrounding Baghdad. For now, the rest of the country is mostly calm. The provincial elections will test political stability: whether Iraqis can begin to resolve still festering sectarian and ethnic tensions through the ballot box. The formal process of disengagement started in earnest in November, when the Iraqi Parliament approved a new security agreement with the Americans that sealed the date of departure, by the end of 2011, and almost immediately changed the balance of power. The outlook of Iraqi citizens has changed as well. They are more confident that their problems are their own, and that the Americans cannot fix them and often have only made matters worse. “The American military presence brought nothing to our streets but destruction and chaos,” said Omar al-Dulaimi, 57, a government employee who lives near the Um al-Khoura mosque, one of the largest Sunni places of worship in the capital. “We had nothing from them but tension and confusion. It’s much better for us and for them if they stay in their bases now.” That resentment of the American presence boiled over in 2007 after Blackwater Security guards opened fire on Iraqi civilians in Nisour Square, killing 17 of them and wounding more than 30. That episode, which was widely publicized in Iraq and abroad, crystallized Iraqi loathing and resentment of what they saw as Americans’ casual disregard for Iraqi lives — and their own powerlessness to hold the Americans to account. Such anger helped embolden Iraqis to drive a tough bargain on the security agreement, which cemented their sense that they were, at last, seizing control of their own destiny. The Iraqi resolve surprised the Americans, who in the end were forced to accept a hard deadline for departure, give up immunity for contractors like Blackwater and give Iraqis explicit authority over all military operations in the country. Now, for both sides there is the feeling that something has changed and that whatever happens next, Iraq will not return to the way it was. “We’re going through transition in Iraq at the same time we’re going through transition in our forces here,” said Gen. Ray Odierno, the commanding general for Iraq. “They will elect new provincial governments. I believe 75 percent to 80 percent of the provincial governments will change, and oh, by the way, we’ll begin to reduce our troops’ size.” The shifts are subtle, often unspoken. The American military role now has less to do with protecting Iraqis and more with giving them the psychological reassurance that they can handle what comes their way. The Americans no longer tell the Iraqis what to do, and the Iraqis, especially Iraqi Army officers, no longer look to the Americans for approval. At least that is the case in areas where the fighting has stopped; less so in areas like Mosul where American military might is still required to keep violence at bay. When General Odierno stopped to inspect a polling center in rural Medaen, south of Baghdad, on Wednesday, his conversation with the Iraqi Army general who oversees the area was respectful, a little formal: two military men exchanging information. It was not exactly a conversation between equals; each knew that the other was from a different world, each knew the Americans have superior arms and training, and each offered the other his observations. “I see less Sunni-Shia issues than I do a lot of other issues here,” General Odierno said. Gen. Qassim al-Maliki nodded. “We have a lot of Shia voting this time,” he said. “We didn’t have a lot in the last election,” he said. As the American military slowly steps back, the diplomats and the civilians are emerging from the wings. Certainly, this is far from a normal diplomatic relationship. Iraqis entering any area close to the Americans are still subject to multiple humiliating searches and interminable waits. American diplomats cannot yet leave the embassy; they live like virtual prisoners, every movement beyond its gates an armed undertaking. But it is possible for Americans and Iraqis to talk about issues other than sheer survival. Iraqis, too, are beginning to explore a different kind of relationship, one that no longer looks to the Americans only for protection. Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has agreed to finance a substantial scholarship program to send Iraqis to the United States and British Commonwealth countries for study, in an effort to create a better educated professional class. Still, the American era in Iraq is nowhere near a final act. If this were an opera, it would be just past midway in the libretto. While both sides are disconnecting, neither can let go entirely. The Iraqis need the Americans not just to dampen terrorist activities within the country but to protect them from predatory neighbors. Syria and Iran have interfered here since the invasion, and while the Iraqis are often uncomfortable with how the Americans have reined in these powers, they are reluctant to stop them because they fear their neighbors more. When American forces pursued insurgents over the Iraqi border into Syria in late October, it was an international incident. Iraq was embarrassed in front of the Arab world. Such incidents are likely to recur and could become much more fraught. For the United States, Iraq remains a strategic prize close to the Middle East flash points of Israel, Lebanon and Syria as well as Iran and the oil-rich Persian Gulf countries. It is not by chance that the Central Intelligence Agency has its largest station in the world in Baghdad. It is inescapable that the United States exerts more influence here than in any other oil-producing country — and will be intent on continuing to do so. Iraq will be eager to demonstrate its independence; the United States will have to rely on levers other than a huge and continuing military presence. This promises considerable tension as each side redefines its relationship. The elections on Saturday were a step toward a peaceful approach to settling disagreements among factions about the shape of the country. If new governments are seated from north to south and east to west, the United States and Iraq can begin the next act in earnest. If all goes well, “The United States will not need big troops here,” said Jawad al-Bolani, the interior minister, a secular Shiite. “The Americans need to look at something besides security. Iraq needs America to start a new chapter.”",

    "source": "Justices Hear Debate on Suing Companies for Seemingly Harmless Falsehoods <eos> WASHINGTON — A case about false information on the Internet gave rise to a vivid and occasionally personal argument on Monday at the Supreme Court . The question in the case was whether companies that say false but seemingly benign things about consumers may be sued under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that many sorts of apparently harmless misinformation could cause damage. She said, by way of example, that she knew single people who searched the Internet to find out if prospective dates were married or not. “So if you’re not married and there’s a report out there saying you are, that’s a potential injury,” Justice Sotomayor said. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy suggested that the ubiquity of questionable information in the digital age may require a fresh approach. “On the Internet, in this cyber-age that we have where all this information is out, there has to be some real injury” caused by misinformation, he said, suggesting that mass dissemination of falsehoods may warrant different treatment than neighborhood gossip. The case concerned Spokeo, a company that sells personal data online. It distributed a profile of Thomas Robins that was riddled with errors. The profile said he had a graduate degree, though he did not; that he was employed and in good shape financially, though he was out of work; and that he was married and had children, though neither was true. The profile included a photograph of a different man. “These are not unimportant details,” Justice Elena Kagan said. “They basically got everything wrong about him. You know, they got his marital status wrong. They got his income wrong. They got his education wrong. They basically portrayed a different person.” Mr. Robins sued under a part of the credit law that provides damages of up to $1,000 without proof of direct harm, and he sought to represent a class of people with similar claims. Spokeo responded that Congress did not have the power to create a legal right to sue for plaintiffs who have suffered no direct and concrete injuries. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit last year disagreed . “A plaintiff can suffer a violation of the statutory right without suffering actual damages,” a unanimous three-judge panel ruled. Justice Kagan said that false statements may be damage enough. “Why isn’t the dissemination of false information about you in a credit report,” she asked, “perfectly sufficient if Congress says that’s a concrete injury?” Andrew J. Pincus, a lawyer for Spokeo, said suits should be allowed only if plaintiffs can show the concrete injury generally required to establish standing to sue. He gave two examples: harm to credit or a missed job opportunity. Justice Kagan responded that people almost never know why a bank or potential employer turned them down. “I mean,” she said, “it’s actually the quintessential kind of injury that you will never be able to detect and surely not to prove.” But Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked, “Is there anything here to indicate that anybody other than Mr. Robins ever did a search for him” on the Spokeo site? William S. Consovoy, a lawyer for Mr. Robins, said there was nothing in court records to show that. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. gave examples of what he said were harmless falsehoods. He asked, for instance, whether someone with an unlisted phone number could sue Spokeo for giving an inaccurate one. Mr. Consovoy said Congress could allow suits over that misinformation. Malcolm L. Stewart, a lawyer for the Obama administration, argued in support of Mr. Robins, a stance that seemed to surprise Chief Justice Roberts. “I would have thought that the president would be concerned about Congress being able to create its own enforcement mechanism,” he said. “I thought that you would be concerned that that would interfere with the executive’s prerogative.” Mr. Stewart said he could imagine a law presenting that problem. The credit law, however, was appropriate and valuable, he said. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the lurking issue in the case, Spokeo Inc. v. Robins , No. 13-1339, was the possibility of a class action involving “millions of plaintiffs and billions of dollars.” But both she and Justice Kagan suggested that class certification might not be appropriate for claims under the credit law like the one pressed by Mr. Robins.",

    "source": "RIM’s Delay Caused by Poor Performance, Analysts Say <eos> OTTAWA — When Research in Motion said in December that a new line of BlackBerry phones would not appear until the end of 2012, the announcement provoked equal parts of shock and disbelief from analysts. Shock because even RIM acknowledges that the new phones are vital to reversing its rapid loss of market share in North America. At the same time, analysts were skeptical about the company’s explanation that the delay stemmed from its decision to wait for a new, improved microprocessor. Instead, many analysts say that both the new phones and RIM’s new operating system, BlackBerry 10, may have significant performance problems and are delaying the project. “They can’t get the infrastructure and the operating system ready in time,” said Peter Misek, an analyst with Jefferies & Company. Alkesh Shah, an analyst at Evercore Partners, agreed. “Waiting for the chipset is a contributing factor in a number of factors that led to the delay,” he said. “Creating the ecosystem for the phones is the bigger problem.” Mr. Shah and several other analysts said that delays in the development of BlackBerry 10 and poor battery performance in prototype versions of the new phones were behind the decision to further delay production until faster, smaller and more power-efficient chips became available in late 2012. Those delays made it impossible for RIM to begin selling the new phones early in 2012, as it first promised. “One of the problems is the delay in the BB 10 software and that may have led to the selection of chips that caused the most recent delay,” said Rod Hall, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase. While the analysts’ skepticism is partly based on speculation, it has also been fueled by RIM’s general loss of credibility with them. For more than a year, the company has been forced to repeatedly restate financial forecasts and failed to deliver some critical, new products on time. “They don’t have a firm grasp of the issues and realities of bringing these phones to market,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “There are not many believers right now,” RIM has declined to identify the new chip. RIM also declined to comment directly about development problems with BlackBerry 10 or the battery life of the new phones. It reiterated the earlier remarks of its co-chief executives, Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis, that the delay was simply the result of its decision to wait for an improved chipset. “RIM made a strategic decision to launch BlackBerry 10 devices with a new, LTE-based dual core chipset architecture,” the company said, referring to a chip that supports a high-speed wireless service known as LTE that is now available in some parts of the United States. “As explained on our earnings call, the broad engineering impact of this decision and certain other factors significantly influenced the anticipated timing for the BlackBerry 10 devices.” But it is no secret that RIM has been struggling with its new operating system, which is based on technology from QNX Software Systems, a company based in Ottawa that RIM acquired in 2010.The BlackBerry PlayBook , RIM’s money-losing tablet computer , was the company’s first product to use a QNX operating system. Despite the BlackBerry brand’s strong association with e-mail, it arrived in April 2011 without e-mail software or the ability to directly synchronize users’ address books and calendars. Software that was supposed to remedy those issues and others has been delayed and is now promised for February. Mr. Misek, said that RIM initially tried to merge, or thread, some of its current operating system with QNX to speed up the development timetable. But that proved unsuccessful, forcing RIM to create more software code from scratch than it initially anticipated. Michael Morgan, the senior analyst for mobile devices at ABI Research, said that many problems with BlackBerry 10 came from making it work on RIM’s network, which moves all BlackBerry data, giving corporate e-mail a high level of security and all users lower wireless data bills. To accommodate people with both BlackBerry phones and PlayBook tablets, RIM had to redesign security features on its network, which currently allow only one hand-held device access to any given user’s account, Mr. Morgan said. “When you change something that low level in an operating system, it has ramifications which affect every function,” Mr. Morgan said. Like many analysts, Mr. Morgan also says he thinks that RIM is struggling to bring the long battery life that has been a hallmark of BlackBerrys to the new phones. While the QNX operating system has a reputation for reliability, he said, it has been mainly used in situations where power consumption is not a significant concern. Many touch-screen navigation and control systems in cars, for example, use QNX. But automobiles carry large batteries and alternators that recharge them. When ABI’s researchers disassembled PlayBook tablets, Mr. Morgan said, they found several systems to reduce power consumption. He said, however, that those measures might not be enough for phones that will have much smaller batteries than the PlayBook. “QNX is being applied now in a place it hasn’t been before,” he said. Adding to the problem is RIM’s decision to make the new phones operate on LTE networks. Most current chips that operate on those high-speed networks have a reputation for quickly draining batteries. While LTE networks are relatively scarce today, they are likely to be an important selling point for new phones a year from now.",

    "source": "Snacking at the Roman Colosseum? Prepare to Pay a Fine <eos> ROME — Dapper as always in their bleached white shirts and matching caps, members of Rome’s municipal police force were out on the Spanish Steps one warm autumn day, trolling for offenders. “Stefano, look! There’s another eater,” one officer said to another before sauntering over to a baffled couple who had begun munching on an inoffensive-looking meal while sitting on the steps. The culprits, a couple of foreign tourists, had settled down on the landmark, one of Rome’s most famous. In their hands were the offending items: sandwiches. The officers pounced, and after much waving of hands, the couple wrapped up the sandwiches and slouched away, looking sheepish. They were in violation — unwittingly, in all probability — of a municipal ordinance that went into force this month. The measure outlaws eating and drinking in areas of “particular historic, artistic, architectonic and cultural value” in Rome’s center, to better protect the city’s monuments, which include landmarks like the Colosseum , the Pantheon and the Spanish Steps . Fines range all the way up to $650 for culinary recidivists. Italian cities, Rome included, have long enacted ordinances and regulations to protect monuments from ill-mannered tourists (and residents). But after a recent stroll through the city center, where he saw several people making themselves at home, literally, Rome’s mayor, Gianni Alemanno, decided the rules needed toughening. Antonio Gazzellone, the municipal council member responsible for tourism, noting that alcohol may have been involved, said, “There were people camped out, and we weren’t able to move them.” The new ordinance, which also outlaws camping or “setting up makeshift beds,” will “give monuments back their proper decorum,” he said. “Rome needs to be protected, its beauty respected.” But there has already been some grumbling around town. Recently, a salesclerk named Massimo strode off with his lunch after a police officer sharply blew her whistle until he stopped eating a sandwich on the Spanish Steps. “It seems to me that the municipal police have more important things to deal with than people eating sandwiches,” said Massimo, who asked that his last name not be used because, after all, he had just broken the law. Others fretted that the ordinance is too broad. “From now on, a tourist walking around the Colosseum with an ice cream cone will be fined,” said Angelo Bonelli, a member of Italy ’s Green Party, who flagrantly challenged the ban by eating a sandwich in front of the Pantheon while taunting a municipal police officer. Rome has passed any number of bans during the past five years, against prostitutes, homeless people and men taking their shirts off in parks to sunbathe, Mr. Bonelli noted, often to little effect. “You can’t govern with bans,” he said of Mayor Alemanno. “It’s a sign of his inability to control the city.” Many Romans agree. One recent Saturday, a few hundred protesters gathered in a flash mob on the steps leading to City Hall, chomping on pizza and panini as police officers registered the offenders. “Panino is not a crime,” one attendee wrote on his Facebook page. Other Italian cities, where tourists and residents coexist in a delicate balance, have also taken measures to promote civility and good manners. For years it has been illegal in Venice to eat bag lunches while sitting on the steps around St. Mark’s Square, where 25 million tourists converge each year, said Marco Agostini, the city’s director general. “It’s the one place in Venice that all visitors want to see,” he said, “and we can’t have a situation where you have to climb over people eating salami sandwiches.” This summer, Venice — along with the square’s business association — hired eight people to act as “guardians” of St. Mark’s, answering sundry questions, like “Where do I find the Colosseum?” Mr. Agostini said, and not only politely informing tourists that the Colosseum is in Rome but also directing them to the gardens just around the corner, where munching outdoors is legal. In Florence , too, rope cordons went up this summer around the steps of the city’s cathedral, where visitors were asked not to sit. Custodians kept watch from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day, “but in fact, after hours, people went back to sitting there,” said Ambra Nepi, the spokeswoman for the Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore , which oversees the cathedral and nearby religious monuments. Ms. Nepi said she understood that Florence could be expensive for some tourists, hence the bag lunches, and that there was a distinct lack of benches in the city center. But some visitors “abused the situation” and sprawled on the cathedral steps to suntan or nap, she said. “People need to know that after all this is a church,” she added. “It’s a way of educating visitors, and it’s not as though we went out with guns.” Mr. Gazzellone, Rome’s head of tourism, dismissed concerns that visitors strolling with ice cream or slices of pizza would be fined, “as long as they throw any waste in the trash bins.” It’s more a question of civility, he said: “You wouldn’t eat a pizza and drop tomato sauce all over the steps of the White House in Washington .” The ban must be renewed at the end of the year, he said, but that is considered pro forma. “We’ll see what the results are,” he said of the new law. “Personally, I hope it is never applied — because it means that citizens and guests to Rome have understood how to behave. I hope we don’t make a penny — because it means the city is being respected in its beauty.”",

    "source": "On Patrol With Police as Philippines Battles Drugs <eos> MANILA — Officer Kathlyn Domingo walked through a maze of narrow alleys, ducking under jumbles of electrical wires and hanging laundry to the open doorway of a flimsy two-story house made of found wood and rusty nails. Tough, earnest and carrying a .45-caliber pistol with a pink grip, Officer Domingo, 30, patrols one of Manila’s most destitute slums, Santa Ana. Last month, I spent a night on patrol with her and some colleagues, to see, from their perspective, the Philippines’s deadly crackdown on drug dealers and users. More than 2,000 people have been killed by the police — and at least an additional 1,000 by vigilantes — since President Rodrigo Duterte took office in July and promised to rid the country of the drug scourge. Officer Domingo prefers to focus not on the violent nature of Mr. Duterte’s campaign , but on the 750,000 people who have surrendered to the police and presumably given up a life of drugs and crime. She called through the doorway to one of them, Roberto Elsis. Officer Domingo said Mr. Elsis was holding down a job. He told me he had not used drugs since 2007, so I asked him why he was surrendering now. Image Roberto Elsis came to the door at the beckoning of Officer Kathlyn Domingo. Credit Aurora Almendral “I was on the watch list,” Mr. Elsis explained, referring to the list of names drawn up by government officials. “I had no choice.” Neighborhood leaders and police and drug enforcement officers compile lists of those suspected of using or dealing methamphetamine, and then officers go door to door to find them. Those who do not agree to turn themselves in can end up dead . As we walked back to the car, a woman stopped us. It was Mr. Elsis’s mother, who had heard that the police had gone to her son’s door. “I was scared,” she said. “I thought they were going to kill him.” I saw no killings on my shift, but I saw plenty of fear. Residents of Santa Ana and other slums told me that armed, masked police officers roam their streets at night threatening young men who worry about being shot dead or swept into overcrowded jails. One woman, who did not want to give her name for fear of reprisal, said life was easier when she only had to avoid drug dealers. Now, she said, the enemy is the police. But the officers say Mr. Duterte has ushered in a new era of safety and order. The streets have been cleaned up, there is less crime and drug dealers have gone into hiding. The police say people are grateful, a sentiment backed up by polls showing Mr. Duterte’s job approval rating has remained steadily high at 77 percent. Image Col. Robert Domingo, a onetime commander of the Santa Ana station, is among those who believe the Philippines is under a new era of safety and order. Credit Aurora Almendral “The community trusts us,” said Col. Robert Domingo, who was commander of the Santa Ana station, but has since been reassigned. He said Mr. Duterte had bolstered officers’ morale and inverted the relationship between the police and criminals: “We’re the ones hunting them down now, when before they used to hunt us.” As part of the antidrug campaign, the Santa Ana force swelled to 250 officers from 149, part of Mr. Duterte’s effort to expand the national police by thousands of officers. “This is not business as usual in the Philippine National Police,” Colonel Domingo said. “This is a war. This is the golden age of the Philippine police.” When I arrived at the Santa Ana station at 6 p.m. on a Saturday, I was immediately confronted with a steaming tangle of limbs and shirtless bodies. The station’s jail — a single cell, about 12 feet wide by 20 feet deep — held 48 men, some of whom said they had been there for more than a month. Men crouched on the floor, leaned against one another, hung from the rafters in hammocks. They share one toilet inside the cell. The air was rank with sweat. Image The jail at the station in Santa Ana, whose officers patrol one of Manila’s most destitute slums. Credit Aurora Almendral I headed out for patrol with three polite young officers. Mark Castañeda, 25, ran through the typical cases he might encounter on patrol: busted manhole covers, fights between neighbors. He joked that the cruelest call he had ever responded to was for cat abuse. When we turned a corner into Dagonoy, a slum crammed with makeshift houses, Officer Castañeda said: “Now we’re entering the war zone.” Video Our reporter, Aurora Almendral, spoke to a police officer, Mark Castañeda, in the Philippines about vigilante killings prompted by President Rodrigo Duterte's campaign against drugs. Drugs are openly dealt and used in Dagonoy, but “war zone” felt like an exaggeration. Families were sitting outside, children playing in the street. As we drove through with police lights spinning, teenagers stopped their basketball game to glare at us. I asked Mr. Castañeda about the vigilante killings, and he assumed I was referring to the widespread belief in the slums that the police were involved, backed up by a growing body of anecdotal evidence collected by the Philippine Commission on Human Rights that supports that assumption. He does not believe the police are involved but says that many people do because “we’re the only ones with the capacity” to kill. At the 8 p.m. shift change, Mr. Castañeda dropped me off at the Dagonoy police substation, where a sign taped to the wall reads: “Dagonoy PCP observed human rights.” Image The police substation in Dagonoy, a slum in Santa Ana where drugs are openly dealt and used. Credit Aurora Almendral Dave Abarra, the station’s captain, said he posted the sign to remind officers not to abuse suspects. When I asked him about the rights of the suspects killed without trial, Captain Abarra said, “Human rights activists defend the rights of the drug addicts and users, not the rights of their victims.” Then I met Officer Domingo, who was preparing for a night of visiting drug suspects. She proudly showed me a three-inch-thick file of signed papers of surrender, and we flipped through her cellphone photos of users. Image Officer Domingo showing photos of drug users who have surrendered. Credit Aurora Almendral She tapped the face of a man she encountered on a previous door-to-door operation. “He surrendered to me and promised to stop,” she said. The next time she saw him, he was in the Santa Ana jail, having being swept up by other officers. “It was so annoying,” she said. “He even tried to hide from me.” During the shift, Officer Domingo met with Bernardita Enales, chairwoman of the Barangay 775 neighborhood, who had called for drug suspects to come to her office to surrender. Image Bernardita Enales, center, the chairwoman of the Barangay 775 neighborhood, in her office with a couple seeking to surrender. Credit Aurora Almendral Ms. Enales was dozing in her chair when we arrived. No one had shown up. “They’re afraid of getting killed!” Ms. Enales said, laughing. Officer Domingo laughed politely, and added that maybe they were afraid of getting caught, or put in jail. A watchman eventually rounded up a husband and wife. The man admitted to using drugs; the woman said she had never tried them. Officer Domingo filled out the surrender papers for both. The effectiveness of the antidrug campaign depends on the cooperation of neighborhood officials like Ms. Enales, but she has produced only seven surrenders in the five months since the start of the campaign, according to police records. Image At the end of the night of patrolling, the police car sat outside the Dagonoy police substation. Credit Aurora Almendral We spent the rest of the night making rounds. Captain Abarra joined us, and pointed out an empty alley where he said drug dealers used to hang out, until three of them were killed the week before. “It’s true that fear has an effect,” he said. “If you’re gentle with the right hand, you have to be hard with the left.”",

    "source": "French Publisher Won’t Print Book on Moroccan King After Authors’ Arrest <eos> PARIS — A major French publishing house has decided not to publish a book critical of King Mohammed VI of Morocco after its two authors were arrested last week in Paris and charged with blackmail and extortion on accusations they demanded 2 million euros, or about $2.3 million, to keep the book unpublished. The latest developments in the affair have been likened by the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, to a “bad movie.” The scandal, which raised questions of journalistic ethics here, has nonetheless erupted less than a year after relations between Morocco and France were mended following a long diplomatic row. Lawyers on both sides are now fighting a media battle to paint the authors either as devious journalists interested only in leveraging their work to make money or as respected but fallible professionals who fell into a financially tempting trap laid before them by the Moroccan leadership. The Éditions du Seuil publishing house said in a statement on Monday that its “relationship of trust” with the authors, Catherine Graciet and Eric Laurent, had been “dissolved” and that publication of their book, initially planned for early 2016, could not go ahead. Mr. Laurent has said that he will try to publish the book elsewhere. The two authors were arrested last week during a police sting operation after a meeting with a representative from the Moroccan royalty in a luxury hotel in Paris. The Moroccan authorities had filed a complaint of blackmail after a first meeting between Mr. Laurent and the royal representative, which led to the opening of a formal investigation in Paris. The Journal du Dimanche newspaper, which said it had obtained audio recordings made by the representative at the meetings and a document signed by the two journalists, reported on Sunday that Mr. Laurent and Ms. Graciet had agreed to never write about Morocco again in exchange for 2 million euros. They left the hotel with a cash advance of 40,000 euros, or about $45,000, each, the newspaper reported. The police, who were monitoring the meeting, then swooped in to arrest them. Lawyers for Mr. Laurent and Ms. Graciet confirmed in telephone interviews that their clients had signed the document and received the cash advance, but said that the Journal du Dimanche had published truncated and misleading excerpts from the audio recordings made during the meetings. Both lawyers questioned the legal grounds of the sting operation and said they would try to have the case thrown out. Mr. Laurent and Ms. Graciet are currently free under court supervision and have been barred from speaking with each other. Neither has denied that they accepted a financial transaction. But both assert that it was Mohammed VI’s representative, not them, who first made the offer to pay to keep the book under wraps, rejecting accusations that they were attempting to blackmail the king and describing the deal instead as a “trap” that they fell into. Mr. Laurent, in a phone interview from his lawyer’s office, said that the idea of paying not to publish had first been put forward by the Moroccan representative, a lawyer named Hicham Naciri, whom he first met in Paris on Aug. 11. The meeting, the first of three, was set up after Mr. Laurent called the king’s office in late July for comment on the two journalists’ reporting. Mr. Laurent said he ended up accepting the deal, mainly for personal reasons — his wife has cancer, he said. “I was tempted,” Mr. Laurent said. “Do I regret it? Yes, probably. But I’ve been doing this job for over 35 years, I don’t have anything to hide, and I work on the assumption that what was offered to us was a private transaction related to my work.” “I took risks to investigate, to discover a certain number of things, to acquire a certain number of documents,” Mr. Laurent added. “After that, it’s my right to publish a book or not to publish a book.” Ms. Graciet trod a similarly fine line between journalistic integrity and criminal liability in her defense, acknowledging that the deal was ethically wrong but arguing that it was a private transaction consented to by both parties, and that it broke no laws. She told Le Parisien, a newspaper, that Mr. Laurent had told her about the Moroccan representative’s offer but that she was incredulous about it, and agreed to attend the last meeting at Mr. Naciri’s insistence to learn more — only to be tempted by the offer as well. “I had a moment of weakness,” she said. “It’s human, no? Everyone wonders what one could do with their life with 2 million euros. Try to imagine the situation. And it was to forgo publication of a book, not to kill someone.” Still, the news that Ms. Graciet and Mr. Laurent had consented to pull their book project in exchange for money was all the more shocking in France and Morocco because they had established a reputation in both countries as fierce critics of the Moroccan leadership. In 2012 they published a book that depicted Mohammed VI as a “predator king” who had carved up Morocco’s economy to increase his personal wealth. Ms. Graciet also wrote a book with Nicolas Beau in 2009 that criticized Leila Trabelsi, the wife of the former Tunisian dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali , and in 1993 Mr. Laurent had published a more positive book made up of interviews with Hassan II, Mohammed VI’s father and predecessor. Eric Dupond-Moretti, the Moroccan king’s lawyer in France, speaking to the i-Télé news channel on Monday, said that Mr. Laurent was the “first to mention money” and maintained accusations that the journalists had blackmailed the Moroccan king by suggesting that the book would contain information that might destabilize the monarchy. Without offering specifics, Mr. Laurent did not deny that he and Ms. Graciet were working on information that was compromising for the king, saying that the book had the potential to “rattle” the monarchy. He said Mr. Naciri insisted that they reveal the sources of their reporting for the book, which they refused to do. France and Morocco recently resumed judicial cooperation after an extended diplomatic spat , but Mr. Fabius, the foreign minister, brushed aside any suggestions that their relationship might sour once more over the affair. “It’s a bad movie,” Mr. Fabius said on French radio and television on Sunday. “It doesn’t shake up relations between our two countries.”",

    "source": "Family Battles U.S. Over 10 Double Eagle Coins Worth Millions <eos> PHILADELPHIA — Who owns 10 exceedingly rare American gold coins from 1933? Is it the family of a local gold dealer who died 21 years ago? Or is it the United States government, which produced a half million of the coins before melting all of them — well, almost all of them — down? Family members, who say they found the coins in a safe deposit box in 2003, argue they are the rightful owners of the exquisite “double eagle” $20 coins, each now worth millions of dollars. The government argues that the coins, never officially released, belong to the United States, and not the heirs of Israel Switt, the gold dealer. And so to court. In a case that began on Thursday, jurors are getting an unusual lesson in Depression-era history, and will ultimately decide whether Mr. Switt was merely “colorful,” as a lawyer for the family described him, or a thief. Each side explained in opening arguments that, for all of the history and complexities of 1930s Mint procedures and records to come, the case is quite simple. They disagreed, however, about what the simple point of the case was. Assistant United States Attorney Jacqueline Romero, presenting the government’s case, told jurors, “You are going to hear a remarkable and intriguing story about gold coins that were stolen from the U.S. Mint.” “Israel Switt was somehow involved” in the theft, she said, probably with the help of a corrupt cashier at the Philadelphia Mint. The government had linked Mr. Switt to every double eagle that had emerged over the decades, she said, including 10 tracked down in the 1940s and one sold with the agreement of the government by a dealer, Stephen Fenton, in 2002 for $7.6 million. That sale was based on a government mistake, she said; these coins would not get the same dispensation. The government will prove, she pledged, that the heirs knew that the goods were not legitimately theirs, and so the jury should return the coins “to their rightful owner, the people of the United States of America.” Barry Berke, a lawyer arguing on behalf of Mr. Switt’s heirs, the Langbord family, told the jury that the case was, simply, about power and government overreach. Washington should not be able to seize property from citizens “unless it can prove it is entitled to — and not just powerful enough to take it,” he said. He called the government’s case an attempt to “rewrite history,” and promised to present alternate explanations for treasured coins coming legitimately into the Langbords’ hands: the mint commonly exchanged coins for gold, he said, and the cashier of the mint kept an “open bag” of 1933 double eagles near his desk. How did the coins get out? Gloriously designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the 1933 double eagles were never officially distributed. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, trying to stop a bank panic and to stem hoarding, issued an executive order that made owning large amounts of gold bullion and coins illegal. So while nearly a half million were made, all but two, sent to the Smithsonian, were supposed to have been reduced to bullion. But in 2004, Joan Langbord, Mr. Switt’s daughter, and her sons contacted the United States Mint to say they had discovered the 10 coins tucked away in a safe deposit box, within a folded Wanamaker’s department store bag, and asked for help in authenticating them. Instead, the government seized the double eagles — an eagle was a $10 piece, a half eagle a $5 — saying that since they had never been circulated, they must have been stolen. The Langbords sued to get them back. In 2009, Judge Legrome D. Davis of Federal District Court, said that the government could not simply assume the coins were government property, and would have the burden of proving the facts in court. While the government has the burden of proof, this is not a criminal case in which guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. It must convince jurors only that a preponderance of the evidence supports its case. In a tough pair of detailed orders issued just before trial, Judge Davis stated flatly that some of the evidence could allow jurors to infer that the coins were stolen and that the family knew it and concealed them. He noted somewhat acerbically in a footnote that the safe deposit box in which Ms. Langbord “claims to have discovered” the coins had been opened by her in 2002, “the day before the Fenton coin was sold at auction.” Even if the jury decides in favor of the Langbords, Judge Davis could still declare the government the rightful owner. That possibility worries coin collectors, said Armen Vartian, a lawyer who filed briefs in the case on behalf of the Professional Numismatics Guild. “The government cannot just go around saying, ‘You have this. We think it’s ours. Give it back,’ ” he said. Having looked at the evidence against the Langbords, he said, “At best, it’s inconclusive,” and added, “You would think that the government has better things to do.” In the courtroom, jury selection took much of the first day. The process, as usual, was grindingly slow, but had its moments. Judge Davis, a large man with a sonorous voice who tips back so far in his chair that sometimes only his head is visible over the desk, asked a potential juror whether the fact that her husband collected coins would influence her. Did she share his hobby? “I don’t collect coins,” she said. “I spend them.” She was seated.",

    "source": "N.B.A.’s Great East-West Divide Remains, but Styles of Play Evolve <eos> Another N.B.A. season is scheduled to begin Tuesday night, but not much has changed from the last one. The Western Conference is again loaded with up-tempo, star-laden teams. Superficially at least, the East is about the luminary named LeBron James and his quest for a sixth straight league finals appearance. One longstanding mystery of the N.B.A. universe is the freewheeling style that took root in the West while the East embraced a more methodical brand of ball. Along conference lines, the geographical word association would be: Out West — Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix and Golden State. Back East — Boston, Detroit, New York and (pre-LeBron) Miami. There have been exceptions, but by reputation the West has traditionally elevated the game as a more aesthetically pleasing form of entertainment while the East has prided itself as survival of the brawniest. Ask Rod Thorn, who has been around the pro game since 1963, why that is, and he says, playfully, “Well, you know, the Western part of the country is more about open spaces, and the East has the congested, more urban cities.” Seriously, he doubted that athletic art had been imitating life. More likely, he said, “it has to do with the makeup of the coaches.” Then again, Mike D’Antoni was an innovating celebrity with his precision fire drill of an offense in Phoenix but a failure with it in New York. And Pat Riley coached Magic Johnson and the Showtime Lakers to four championships in Los Angeles, but when he moved into Madison Square Garden with the Knicks and later to Miami, his teams nearly qualified for the Olympics in Greco-Roman wrestling. The East-West divide probably originated in the early 1980s with the league’s ultimate rivalry: those Johnson-and-Riley Lakers — whose architect was the aptly named Jerry West — and Larry Bird’s lunch-pail Celtics. Those franchises were already the most historically successful, and as Thorn said, “this has always been a copycat league.” He added that after Golden State won the championship in June, led by Stephen Curry’s single-season record barrage of 3-pointers and with a high-voltage pace that had N.B.A. advocates in full-throated cheer, we should expect the game to continue trending in the direction that credentialed old-school folks like Phil Jackson and Gregg Popovich generally loathe. But to cling stubbornly to the past is to fade away with it. In an effort to eradicate the image of them as so 1990s, the Knicks say they are planning to play a faster version of Jackson’s beloved triangle offense this season. Popovich years ago recalibrated his once-plodding offense to feature the pace-pushing skills of Tony Parker. In winning the 2014 finals over Miami, the Spurs launched more 3-pointers (averaging 23.6 per game) than any title-winning team in history — until Curry and the Warriors fired them up at a clip of 31 a game in disposing of James and his Cleveland Cavaliers last June. “We all know if you don’t shoot the 3, you’re probably not going to win,” Popovich said last spring. “Everybody in the league shoots the 3-point shot well and knows the importance. I still hate it.” Image From left, Grizzlies forward Jeff Green, Oklahoma City Thunder center Steven Adams, Grizzlies guard Lazeric Jones and Thunder guard Andre Roberson scrambled for the ball in a preseason game on Oct. 16. Credit Brandon Dill/Associated Press Shooting the 3 at last season’s rate — an average of 22.5 per game — does not require a commitment to a speedball game, as teams increasingly space the floor in their halfcourt offenses and use drive-and-kick penetration to free up long-range marksmen. But Thorn said the spread of up-tempo play around the East was inevitable. “It used to be that no matter how fast teams played in the regular season, the feeling was that the game would slow down in the playoffs,” Thorn said. “With Golden State playing the way they did, I’m not so sure people are thinking that anymore.” He knows that Jason Kidd isn’t buying into any old East-West divergence as he begins his second season as the coach in Milwaukee. The Bucks are blessed with one of the game’s best young end-to-end athletes in Giannis Antetokounmpo, along with Jabari Parker, expected back soon after knee surgery last winter, and point guard Michael Carter-Williams. With the addition of Greg Monroe to score and pass from the post, Kidd’s team, which opens its season at home Wednesday night against the Knicks, could pose an intriguing challenge to James and the Cavaliers, along with last season’s contenders Chicago, Washington, Atlanta and Toronto. Thorn will be in Milwaukee for the opener. After retiring from the N.B.A.’s executive office last spring at 74, he thought he was out until Kidd pulled him back in, hiring him as a consultant. Kidd was part of Thorn’s second-most-impactful player transaction as a team front-office executive (next to drafting Michael Jordan in Chicago) when Thorn brought Kidd — a pass-first point guard — to the Nets in 2001 from Phoenix in a trade for Stephon Marbury. With the ball in Kidd’s hands, the Nets made two consecutive finals, mixing a quicker pace with a version of the Princeton halfcourt offense. Curry and the Warriors may be the rage, but none of their four playoff opponents last season were at full strength, and Thorn is old and wise enough to know that embracing one style does not, or should not, necessarily negate another. Before the playoffs began, West, now a Warriors consultant, told Thorn that the one team he feared was the Spurs. “Jerry thought they had the size and ability to control pace in a way the other teams couldn’t,” Thorn said. To that end, the Spurs are stronger inside with the additions of LaMarcus Aldridge and David West. In Oklahoma City, what restores the Thunder as a serious threat, beyond the presumed health of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, is the front-line athleticism provided by Serge Ibaka, Steven Adams and Enes Kanter, the kind of low-post scorer the team has lacked. Even by old East-West standards, Thorn noted, the truly great teams are those not easily typecast, as demonstrated by Jackson’s six title teams in Chicago and five with the Lakers. “Go back to those Bird teams — they didn’t have fast guys, but they knew how to run a pretty good fast break,” Thorn said. And the Showtime Lakers, he added, could always “slow the game down and throw it inside.” He referred to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the league’s career leading scorer.",

    "source": "Croatian Presidential Election Heads for January Runoff <eos> After a close first round in the Croatian presidential election, the center-left incumbent, Ivo Josipovic, will face his conservative opponent, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, in a runoff election on Jan. 11, the electoral commission said on Monday. With 99.98 percent of ballots counted, Mr. Josipovic of the Social Democratic Party won 38.5 percent in the first round of voting on Sunday, compared with 37 percent for Ms. Grabar-Kitarovic, the electoral commission said. Two other candidates finished with significantly smaller shares of the vote. Candidates needed more than 50 percent in the first round to avoid a runoff. The presidency in Croatia is a largely ceremonial position, but the vote was considered an important test for the main political parties before parliamentary elections scheduled for next year. Croatia, which joined the European Union in 2013 , has one of the weakest economies in the bloc and an unemployment rate of nearly 20 percent. The Social Democratic Party, the largest group in the center-left government that has been blamed for the continuing economic crisis, backed Mr. Josipovic, a law expert and composer. “We won the first round, we will win the second,” Mr. Josipovic, the third president of the former Yugoslav republic, told supporters at his party’s election headquarters late on Sunday. Ms. Grabar-Kitarovic, a former foreign minister and former assistant secretary general of NATO , has vowed to lead the country “toward prosperity.” She is the candidate of the main opposition party, the center-right Croatian Democratic Union. She also served as the Croatian ambassador to the United States from 2008 to 2011. Turnout in the elections was 47 percent, a showing attributed to bad weather, as most of the country was hit by a blizzard overnight.",

    "source": "Veterans’ Cemetery on Long Island Opens a Memorial Garden <eos> Farmingdale WHEN Norma Burlone visits her nephew’s grave at Long Island National Cemetery, she usually spends only 10 minutes. Ms. Burlone, the aunt of Cpl. Julien Alberto Ramon, a marine who died two years ago in Iraq, said she cannot bend or kneel easily and needs frequent rests after leg surgery four years ago. A brick shelter nearby houses makeshift seats, but they are uncomfortable and crowded, she said. “Now I will have more time,” she said, pointing to four new benches where throngs of people were attending a service behind her last Sunday. “I can sit over there and talk to him.” Ms. Burlone, 56, of Flushing, Queens, came on a clear, cool afternoon, not knowing a ceremony was under way to unveil the cemetery’s new 40-foot by 40-foot memorial garden. About 250,000 military veterans are buried there, said Bill Rhoades, the cemetery director. More than 125 veterans and relatives came for the event, some wearing dog tags or McCain campaign buttons. Others carried flowers. Some arrived in uniform. Many with bowed heads had tears in their eyes. “We are today mindful of the past, yet we keep an eye toward the future,” said Dorothy Oxendine, one of the leaders of the memorial effort. “Today we express our commitment to our nation and the message of patriotism and sacrifice as we dedicate this Long Island National Cemetery Memorial Garden in memory of all veterans.” Mrs. Oxendine is past president of the Long Island National Cemetery Memorial Organization and past national president of American Gold Star Mothers, which offers support to and represents mothers of those killed while in the military. Mrs. Oxendine, 82, wanted to create the memorial garden to help those who lost loved ones, she said. And she seemed a fitting choice. She was born on Memorial Street in Middle Village, Queens, and lost her son Pfc. Willie Oxendine III, a marine, on Memorial Day in 1968, when he was killed in Vietnam. Both Mrs. Oxendine’s son and husband, Willie Oxendine Jr., are buried here. It took three years for the memorial garden to become reality, with money coming from the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the United States Submarine Veterans of WWII and Farmingdale’s Rotary Club, among others. The memorial at the 365-acre cemetery contains 118 shrubs, 1,228 bulbs, a Japanese maple tree and four stone benches in the center. Cheryl Anne Lombardo, 49, a horticulturist who lives in Bay Shore, designed the garden. “I came down here and it spoke to me,” she said at the event. Emily Toro, who was celebrating her 49th birthday, said she would use the garden when she visits the grave site of her son Isaac Cortes, an Army private buried nearby. Since he died at the age of 26 in Iraq last November, Ms. Toro said she had come only about four times. “It’s hard,” she said. “It’s hard to come, but I plan to come more often.” Jeanin Urbina, 21, came with her niece, Cydney, 9, and her father, Agustin, 56, to pay respects to her brother, Specialist Wilfredo Urbina, of the Long Island National Guard’s 69th Infantry unit, and to see the memorial garden. Specialist Urbina, of Baldwin, was 29 when he died four years ago in Baghdad. “I think it’s nice to have a place to sit,” Ms. Urbina said. “It gives you perspective.” Ms. Burlone and her family watched with others as the color guard marched around the memorial. They listened as the pledge of allegiance was said, prayers were led and the national anthem sung. American flags flapped in the breeze as a salute was fired by members of the American Legion in Babylon, and taps was played. “To me it’s the perfect setting,” Mr. Rhoades, the cemetery director, said after the event, pointing to rows of white marble headstones of soldiers killed in action, buried to the left and right of the garden memorial. Before she left, Ms. Burlone said she would return the next weekend to spend more than 10 minutes — maybe an hour — visiting her nephew, Corporal Ramon, who was a sniper in Iraq. She said he died at age 22 in 2006 on July 20 — Independence Day in Colombia, which he left when he was 5. He seemed certain he would not return after his second tour of duty, Ms. Burlone said. “But I know he’s around,” she said with swollen eyes. “He’s always around.”",

    "source": "Dalai Lama Urges Aung San Suu Kyi to Help Myanmar’s Rohingya <eos> BANGKOK — When they embraced democracy and vowed to leave behind their repressive and dictatorial past, the leaders of Myanmar enjoyed a honeymoon of praise and admiration from luminaries across the globe. But the country’s harsh treatment of its Rohingya Muslim minority, setting off an exodus of people by boat across Southeast Asia, has unleashed a barrage of criticism in recent days aimed not only at the country’s former generals but also at the leader of Myanmar’s democracy movement, the Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi . The Dalai Lama , the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader and a fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner, was quoted on Thursday in an Australian newspaper as saying that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi should be helping to address the plight of the Rohingya, who number more than a million but are not recognized as citizens of Myanmar, are restricted in their travels and suffer persecution and deprivation. “I met her two times, first in London and then the Czech Republic,” the Dalai Lama told The Australian. “I mentioned about this problem and she told me she found some difficulties, that things were not simple but very complicated.” “But in spite of that I feel she can do something,” he added. The Rohingya are widely reviled in Myanmar, which is overwhelmingly Buddhist and has an influential radical Buddhist political movement. Speaking out for the Rohingya is seen as a form of political kryptonite for any Buddhist politician like Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. Understanding Southeast Asia’s Migrant Crisis About 25,000 migrants left Myanmar and Bangladesh on rickety smugglers’ boats in the first three months of 2015, according to a United Nations estimate. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has offered various explanations in recent years for her reluctance to speak out for the Rohingya, saying at one point that a public airing of her views could further stoke the fires of radical Buddhists, who have ransacked Rohingya villages, displacing more than 100,000 Rohingya. Jonah Fisher, a BBC correspondent in Yangon, said in a Twitter post on Thursday that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s latest statement on the Rohingya was that it was the government’s duty to solve the issue. Her critics have said that someone of her enormous moral authority in Myanmar should take a stronger stance. Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, another winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a recorded message aired this week that aid donors, including the European Union, should make their funding for the impoverished country “conditional on the restoration of citizenship, nationality and basic human rights to the Rohingya.” “A country that is not at peace with itself, that fails to acknowledge and protect the dignity and worth of all its people, is not a free country,” Archbishop Tutu said in remarks that were broadcast at a conference on the Rohingya in Oslo this week. He said he agreed with those who say a “slow genocide” was being committed against the Rohingya. At the same conference, George Soros, the financier and philanthropist who for more than two decades has been active in promoting democracy, sent a videotaped speech in which he said he was “growing discouraged” by developments in Myanmar. “The most immediate threat to Burma’s transition is the rising anti-Muslim sentiment and officially condoned abuse of the Rohingya people,” he said. How Myanmar and Its Neighbors Are Responding to the Rohingya Crisis Myanmar and its neighbors see the people of the Rohingya ethnic group and the seaborne trafficking of migrants in the region very differently, complicating the refugees’ plight. Mr. Soros said he visited a Rohingya settlement in January and saw parallels to his youth as a Jew in Nazi-occupied Europe. “You see, in 1944, as a Jew in Budapest, I too was a Rohingya,” he said. The Rohingya settlement was a ghetto, he said, an “involuntary home to thousands of families who once had access to health care, education and employment.” “Now, they are forced to remain segregated in a state of abject deprivation. The parallels to the Nazi genocide are alarming.” Myanmar officials are scheduled to meet with their counterparts from other Asian countries in Bangkok on Friday for a meeting to address migrants, chief among them the Rohingya, who have been fleeing Myanmar by the thousands. Myanmar, which changed its name from Burma during the previous military dictatorship and lashes out at governments that continue to refer to the country as Burma, refuses to recognize the term Rohingya and calls the people Bengali instead, suggesting that they come from neighboring Bangladesh. Officials in Myanmar said they would not attend the government meeting in Thailand if the term Rohingya were used. Thailand, which has been reluctant to anger its neighbor, agreed to Myanmar’s demands and titled the conference Special Meeting on Irregular Migration in the Indian Ocean.",

    "source": "With Council Win, Diana Reyna Completes Break With Vito Lopez <eos> Diana Reyna was in her late 20s when she first won a seat on the City Council , backed by her powerful patron, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, the Brooklyn Democratic leader. Inexperienced and seen as serving an ambitious mentor, her opponents dubbed her “Vito Lopez’s Vanna White .” But she distanced herself from Mr. Lopez, and by her second term in office, their fights had broken out into the open. On Thursday, two days after Ms. Reyna won a third term on the Council, soundly beating a challenger backed by Mr. Lopez, her allies said Ms. Reyna’s rebellion meant she would be seen as a true independent, another milestone in her political journey. Ms. Reyna, 35, reflected on the bitter contest, her voice still hoarse from shouting. “My battle representing my community is now made public,” she said. In fact, the subtext of the race for City Council the 34th District drew notice long ago, and it read like this: Assemblyman Lopez, motivated in part by his long-running feud with Ms. Reyna, threw his influence behind Maritza Davila, a Democratic district leader. The quarrel seeped into zoning fights and churches: In an unusually forward venture into politics by a religious leader, Nicholas A. DiMarzio, the Roman Catholic bishop of Brooklyn, urged voters, via robocalls, to support Mr. Lopez . But the assemblyman’s pull was apparently not enough: Ms. Reyna narrowly beat Ms. Davila in the Democratic primary, and she did it again on Tuesday, beating her opponent, who ran on the Working Families Party line, by 25 percentage points. Martin S. Needleman, who has known Ms. Reyna for more than a decade, said, “She’s grown into a significant player, and she’s clearly no longer waiting for Vito to come back.” Whether the nature of her victory has real implications for her work on the City Council — or her future — remains to be seen. Ms. Reyna says she is now better equipped for housing battles with the Bloomberg administration. But others said they doubted that it would have a real impact on her power, and wondered where Ms. Reyna would go after her four-year term was up. The real winners may have been Ms. Reyna’s supporters, who engineered a victory without Mr. Lopez. Many of those supporters are now counting on her help opposing a planned rezoning of the Broadway Triangle, a 31-acre parcel of land that is the subject of a housing dispute in Williamsburg. They face an uphill battle: The City Council is set to decide the matter this month. The plan was a central front in the campaign. In an interview, Mr. Lopez said Ms. Reyna’s opposition to the project was another example of her “undercutting some of the things I do.” Mr. Lopez said the race had not dented his influence in Brooklyn Democratic politics, noting the strong showing there for the Democratic mayoral candidate, William C. Thompson Jr. “I’m proud of my role as county leader,” Mr. Lopez said. But Ms. Reyna’s supporters saw her victory as proof that Mr. Lopez was not invincible. Representative Nydia M. Velázquez , who has her own long feud with Mr. Lopez and who campaigned for Ms. Reyna, said: “It exposed his vulnerability. He challenged these activists to take destiny into their own hands.” Jo Anne Simon, who ran for City Council in a neighboring district but lost the primary to a candidate backed by Mr. Lopez, said Ms. Reyna’s contest had implications for Brooklyn’s already fractured Democrats. “This was a very divisive season,” she said, citing a “mean-spirited” campaign, and the fact that Mr. Lopez backed a Working Families candidate. “That doesn’t build cohesiveness in the party,” said Ms. Simon, who campaigned for Ms. Reyna. The divisions were captured in a video featured prominently on Ms. Davila’s Web site. In it, Ms. Davila stands next to Mr. Lopez on the steps of City Hall, the two of them flanked by politicians from Brooklyn.

    "source": "More Details Provided in Death of Immigrant <eos> In court documents filed this week, prosecutors in Westchester County provided more details about the death of a homeless Guatemalan man in Mount Kisco in April, saying that the village police officer who drove him to a remote spot and abandoned him also delivered the blow to the abdomen that ultimately proved fatal. The officer, George Bubaris, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of the man, Rene Perez. Officer Bubaris, who is originally from Queens, was also charged with one count of unlawful imprisonment and two counts of official misconduct. He has pleaded not guilty. The county district attorney, Janet DiFiore, had previously said only that Officer Bubaris “restrained Rene Perez and exposed him to a risk of serious physical injury.” But the court documents show that Mr. Perez, an illegal immigrant, had frequent run-ins with the authorities and had been arrested at least 59 times on charges including indecent exposure and petty larceny. He had been drinking heavily that night, and police officers in the neighboring town of Bedford drove him to Mount Kisco after complaints that he was bothering customers at a department store. Sometime before 11 p.m., Mr. Perez called 911 from a coin laundry in Mount Kisco and asked for a ride to a hospital, according to police records. Officer Bubaris was the first of three officers who responded. In the court documents, filed in Westchester County Superior Court on Thursday, prosecutors said Mr. Perez was “highly and visibly intoxicated” and asserted that Officer Bubaris, at some point during his encounter with Mr. Perez, “inflicted blunt force trauma to Perez’s abdomen” and left him on Byram Lake Road. The prosecutors added, “The defendant then abandoned the helpless and severely injured Perez in this remote area knowing that he could not extricate himself from his predicament nor protect himself from the elements or other potential dangers or avail himself of any assistance.” “All of the above,” prosecutors wrote, “resulted in Perez’s death.” According to other court documents, Officer Bubaris told a fellow officer that he had picked up Mr. Perez and taken him to Byram Lake Road. A day later, Officer Bubaris told the same officer, “You’re the only one who knows, bro’.” Eddie Hayes, Officer Bubaris’s lawyer, said of the prosecutors’ statements, “They have nothing to support this allegation.” He added: “There were faint contusions on the guy’s abdomen. That fact that his insides rotted out shouldn’t surprise anyone, since he’s been abusing himself for decades.” A wrongful-death lawsuit seeking damages was filed this week on behalf of Mr. Perez’s estate, according to Jonathan Lovett, a lawyer representing Mr. Perez’s family. The suit claims that Officer Bubaris struck Mr. Perez multiple times with a metal baton or a police club, according to Mr. Lovett, who said that claim was based on the autopsy report. The suit, filed in Federal District Court in White Plains, also faults the Village of Mount Kisco and the Town of Bedford for what Mr. Lovett called “border dumping,” or the practice by police officers of escorting troublemakers out of town.",

    "source": "Obama to Appeal Ruling Curbing Recess Appointments <eos> WASHINGTON — The Obama administration has decided that it will appeal to the Supreme Court a sweeping ruling by an appeals court in January that President Obama violated the Constitution when he bypassed the Senate in making three recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board last year. While the dispute grew out of a narrow and novel legal question — whether brief “pro forma” sessions by the Senate could prevent the president from making recess appointments during a lengthy winter break by lawmakers — the appeals court blew past that issue and called into question nearly two centuries of recess appointments by presidents of both parties. The three-judge panel of the appeals court in Washington ruled that presidents may bypass the confirmation process only during the sort of recess that occurs between formal sessions of Congress, rather than other breaks throughout the year. The gaps between formal sessions generally arise just once a year and sometimes — as in 2012, when the Senate had not formally adjourned before the next session began — are skipped entirely. Two of the three judges on the panel also ruled that presidents may fill only vacancies that arise during that same recess. Together, the reasoning would virtually eliminate the recess appointment power for future presidents at a time when it has become increasingly difficult to obtain up-or-down Senate votes on nominees. Partisan views on the issue are volatile. In the fairly recent past, Democrats have argued against the validity of appointments in the middle of a session, and Republicans have supported them. In 1993, after President George Bush made a recess appointment just before leaving office, the Senate legal counsel developed a friend-of-the-court brief for a legal challenge to the appointment, arguing that it was invalid because it did not come between sessions. The Senate majority leader at the time, George Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, wanted to file the brief in the lawsuit on behalf of the Senate, but the minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, blocked him from doing so. The case was later resolved on different grounds. Image Terence F. Flynn’s appointment to the National Labor Relations Board is among those at issue. Credit NLRB And in 2004, after President George W. Bush, during a weeklong break in the midst of a Senate session, made a recess appointment of William H. Pryor Jr. to be an appeals court judge, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, filed briefs in several court cases challenging the appointment. Mr. Kennedy also sent letters to each of the judge’s fellow jurists warning them that any ruling they might make with him on the bench could be invalid. The Bush administration and conservative groups defended Judge Pryor’s appointment, and the appeals court on which he served later upheld its validity even though the appointment was not made between sessions. The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal. Three lawyers who helped work on legal challenges to Judge Pryor’s appointment — Laurence H. Tribe, Martin Lederman and Ronald Weich — later became officials in the Justice Department during Mr. Obama’s first term. Now, however, it is the Obama administration that is arguing for those same recess appointments in the face of a ruling celebrated by conservatives. An official familiar with the deliberations said that lawyers at the White House and the Justice Department, including the White House counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, and Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., had been meeting to discuss strategy with the labor board lawyers. One option was to petition the full United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to rehear the case, hoping that at least one of the judges might write a dissenting opinion that could put more formal analysis before the Supreme Court to counter the ruling. In the end, however, the officials decided that such a move would only delay a resolution that both businesses and labor unions are anxious to have. The current dispute traces back to the end of the George W. Bush administration, when Democrats in the Senate, seeking to prevent recess appointments over its breaks, developed the tactic of sending a senator into the nearly empty chamber every three days to bang the gavel. That act was deemed a pro forma session that carved the longer adjournment into a series of short ones, considered too brief for recess appointments. Then, in 2011, after Republicans took over the House, they used their power under the Constitution to refuse to let the Democratic-controlled Senate adjourn for more than three days. But in January 2012, Mr. Obama challenged the tactic, calling the pro forma sessions a sham and appointing the three members of the labor board, Sharon Block, Terence F. Flynn and Richard Griffin, as well as Richard Cordray to be the director of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Obama has made fewer recess appointments than recent predecessors. But his pronouncement that a president got to decide whether the Senate was in session led many conservatives and some liberals to accuse him of an unconstitutional power grab.",

    "source": "John G. Smale, Procter & Gamble Chief, Dies at 84 <eos> John G. Smale, who as chief executive led Procter & Gamble through a period of extraordinary growth, and then helped engineer a turnaround of General Motors as its chairman, died on Saturday at his home in Cincinnati. He was 84. The cause was complications of pulmonary fibrosis, a Procter & Gamble spokesman said. Mr. Smale ran Procter & Gamble from 1981 until 1990. During his tenure the company strengthened its position internationally, pushing aggressively into Eastern Europe and Asia. He also oversaw a series of major acquisitions, including the $1.2 billion purchase of Richardson-Vicks in 1985. The largest deal in Procter & Gamble’s history at the time, it brought the company well-known brands including Vicks cold medicine, Olay skin care products and Pantene shampoo. He joined the company in 1952 after responding to an advertisement in a Chicago newspaper looking for brand managers. Starting in what was then called the toilet goods division, Mr. Smale earned his stripes managing Procter & Gamble’s new Crest toothpaste brand. He persuaded the American Dental Association to endorse the toothpaste, a pioneering agreement at the time. There were missteps, including a failed push into soft drinks and orange juice. But over his nine-year tenure, Procter & Gamble’s overall revenue doubled to more than $24 billion and profits doubled to $1.6 billion. In 1982, while Mr. Smale was still chief executive at Procter & Gamble, General Motors named him to its board. Ten years later, Mr. Smale and the G.M. board led a coup, ousting Robert C. Stempel as chairman and chief executive. Mr. Smale became chairman, and John F. Smith Jr. the chief executive. During his tenure as G.M.’s chairman, which lasted until his retirement in 1995, Mr. Smale helped rescue the automaker from the brink of bankruptcy and returned it to profitability. He also put in place management techniques from Procter & Gamble, streamlining G.M.’s balkanized management structure and pushing for more forceful marketing of its brands. Mr. Smale also served on several other corporate boards, including those of J. P. Morgan and Eastman Kodak. John Gray Smale and his twin sister, Joy, were born in Listowel, Ontario, on Aug. 1, 1927, and grew up in Elmhurst, Ill. Their father was a traveling salesman for the Marshall Field’s department store chain. He graduated from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, in 1949. While there, he helped pay for his education by writing two how-to books — “Party ’Em Up” and “Party ’Em Up Some More” — that he sold to fraternities and sororities around the country, according to a 2009 interview in the school alumni magazine. His wife of 56 years, the former Phyllis Weaver, died in 2006. His twin sister died in 2000. He is survived by four children, John Gray Jr., Peter, Catherine Anne Caldemeyer and Lisa Smale Corbett; and five grandchildren. An avid fisherman, Mr. Smale had homes in Marathon, Fla., and at McGregor Bay in Ontario. He also kept an apartment in Cincinnati. Mr. Smale was a major figure in Cincinnati’s civic and philanthropic circles. This year he made a $20 million donation to the city in his wife’s memory for construction of the Cincinnati Riverfront Park, which was renamed the Phyllis W. Smale Riverfront Park. He also remained committed to Procter & Gamble after leaving the company. Robert A. McDonald, the current chief executive, said that just before he assumed the top post, he flew to London with Mr. Smale for a company event. Mr. Smale pulled out seven pages of typed notes in midflight and said that he wanted to discuss the future of the company and what it should concentrate on. In capital letters across the front page, Mr. McDonald said, was “INNOVATION, INNOVATION, INNOVATION.” Each year the John G. Smale Innovation Award, a prize financed personally by Mr. Smale, recognizes young scientists at the company. “He represented the soul of P.& G.,” Mr. McDonald said. A. G. Lafley, who preceded Mr. McDonald as chief executive, said that last year Mr. Smale spoke at a meeting of Procter & Gamble leaders. His health failing, Mr. Smale took the stage carrying a machine to help him breathe. He spoke about the importance of having a long-term focus for the 174-year-old company. “He said, we don’t want to think in quarters or even years but in terms of decades and centuries,” Mr. Lafley said. “I learned that from John.”",

    "source": "Pakistan Sentences 10 to Life Terms Over 2012 Attack on Malala Yousafzai <eos> ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A Pakistani court on Thursday sentenced 10 men to life in prison for their role in the 2012 shooting of Malala Yousafzai , the teenage Nobel laureate who defied the Taliban with her calls for girls’ education and won worldwide acclaim for her courage. The sentences were handed down by an antiterrorism court in Swat, the picturesque northern valley that was once a stronghold of the Taliban until a military offensive in 2009 broke their hold. Ms. Yousafzai, who is now 17, was shot in the head in October 2012 when she was returning home from school with her classmates on a bus. After a brief stay in a military hospital in Rawalpindi, she was airlifted for treatment to Britain, where she is now studying and living with her exiled family. In September 2014, the Pakistani military announced the arrest of 10 men it accused of being involved in the attack. Officials said the gunmen took orders from Maulana Fazlullah, the leader of the main Pakistani Taliban branch who is believed to be hiding in Afghanistan, when they attacked Ms. Yousafzai and the other students. The militants held sway in the Swat Valley until 2009, terrorizing the population with their brutal reign, marked by public killings and the lashing of their opponents. Ms. Yousafzai rose to prominence after her blog chronicled life in the valley under Taliban rule and the ambitions of a young girl yearning for an education. Guided by her father, Ziauddin, an advocate for education, she became a symbol against Taliban oppression. Her fame and relentless campaigning rankled the Taliban, who threatened to kill her. Ms. Yousafzai has won several awards for her bravery and was the joint winner of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize along with Kailash Satyarthi, an Indian campaigner for the rights of children.",

    "source": "New Carbon Dating Suggests Neanderthals and Early Humans Didn’t Mingle Much <eos> An improvement in the dating of fossils suggests that the Neanderthals, a heavily muscled, thick-boned human species adapted to living in ice age Europe, perished almost immediately on contact with the modern humans who started to enter Europe from the Near East about 44,000 years ago. Until now bones from several Neanderthal sites have been dated to as young as 29,000 years ago, suggesting there was extensive overlap between the two human species. This raised the question of whether there had been interbreeding between humans and Neanderthals, an issue that is still not resolved. But researchers report that tests using an improved method of radiocarbon dating, based on a new way to exclude contaminants, show that most, and maybe all, Neanderthal bones in Europe are or will be found to be at least 39,000 years old. Thomas F. G. Higham, a specialist in radiocarbon dating at Oxford University, and Ron Pinhasi, an archaeologist at University College Cork in Ireland, have dated the bones of a Neanderthal child less than 2 years old whose remains were found in the Mezmaiskaya Cave in the northern Caucasus Mountains. A second Neanderthal baby, found in a lower layer in the cave, was previously dated back 29,000 years. The first baby, since its bones were retrieved from a higher layer, must be even younger, but in fact it turns out to be 39,000 years old when an improved version of the radiocarbon dating technique is used, Dr. Higham and Dr. Pinhasi reported Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Radiocarbon dating depends on measuring the radioactive isotope of carbon known as carbon 14, which is ingested during a person’s lifetime and steadily decays after death. Very little carbon 14 remains in specimens more than 30,000 years old, and even tiny amounts of contaminating carbon 14 can make a sample seem much younger than it is. Dr. Higham has developed a method of ultrafiltration that removes contaminants and leaves whole molecules of collagen recovered from fossil bone. Reviewing other Neanderthal dates ascertained with the new ultrafiltration method, Dr. Higham sees an emerging pattern that no European Neanderthal site can reliably be dated to less than 39,000 years ago. “It’s only with reliable techniques that we can interpret the archaeological past,” he said. He is re-dating Neanderthal sites across Europe and so far sees no evidence for any extensive overlap between Neanderthals and modern humans. “There was a degree of contemporaneity, but it may not have been very long,” he said. A short period of contact would point to the extinction of the Neanderthals at the hands of modern humans. “It’s very unlikely for Neanderthals to go extinct without some agency from modern humans,” Dr. Higham said. Paul Mellars, an expert on Neanderthals at Cambridge University in England, said that the quality of the dates from Dr. Higham’s laboratory was superb and that samples of bone re-dated by the lab’s method were almost always found to be several thousand years older than previously measured. The picture supported by the new dates is that the interaction between modern humans and Neanderthals in Europe was brief in each region, lasting perhaps a few hundred years, Dr. Mellars said, until the modern humans overwhelmed their competitors through better technology and greater numbers. Richard Klein, a paleoanthropologist at Stanford University, said Dr. Higham’s re-dating was “compelling” and fit with his own view that “modern humans were technologically and intellectually far superior to the Neanderthals.” This, he said, “would have allowed them to spread very rapidly and to precipitate the extinction of the Neanderthals almost immediately on contact.” The new radiocarbon findings show little evidence that the two species peacefully coexisted within Europe. But geneticists who have decoded the Neanderthal genome reported last year that some 2.5 percent of the modern human genome is derived from Neanderthals. The interbreeding, they postulate, occurred not in Europe 40,000 years ago but in an earlier encounter 100,000 years ago. They believe that this encounter must have been in the Near East. Modern humans and Neanderthals occupied the same sites in what is now Israel, but it is not clear that the populations overlapped. The Neanderthals seem to have occupied the sites during cold periods and the modern humans during spells of warmer weather. The presence of modern humans in Israel 100,000 years ago was long assumed to have been a failed attempt to leave Africa, since there is no archaeological evidence of modern humans outside Africa until some 44,000 years ago. But geneticists led by Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology argue that this earlier attempt was in fact successful, and that modern humans commingled with Neanderthals in the Near East before going on to occupy Europe and Asia. This would explain, they say, why Neanderthal genes are found in Europeans and Asians but not in Africans. Dr. Klein said interbreeding between the two species was perfectly possible in principle, “but it’s kind of anti-archaeological because there is no evidence that they overlapped” in the Near East. “I would be more convinced if it were in fact postulated for the extensive, if brief, contact between Neanderthals and modern humans after 50,000 years ago,” he said.",

    "source": "Microsoft Gives Europe Antitrust Documents <eos> BRUSSELS, Nov. 23 — Microsoft submitted a new batch of technical information about its Windows operating system to the European Commission on Thursday, meeting the latest deadline to provide information on whether it is complying with a 2004 antitrust ruling. “This is an important milestone,” Microsoft said in a statement. Final edits and technical review of the information already submitted in July have now been completed, it added, insisting that it had not broken the summer deadline. The commission, which fined Microsoft $357 million in July for failing to comply with the antitrust order, disagrees. Last week, the European competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, expressed growing impatience with Microsoft when she imposed the latest deadline. She described the dossier submitted in July as incomplete and warned Microsoft that it faced daily fines of 3 million euros ($3.9 million) if it did not hand over all the technical information about Windows that the commission had requested. Her department welcomed the company’s submission. “Now the dossier from Microsoft is worth testing,” her spokesman, Jonathan Todd, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. “Potential licensees of the technical information will be invited to Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond to look at it.” In the meantime, the commission and the trustee chosen by Microsoft to oversee the process of compliance with the 2004 ruling will examine the newly submitted information, Mr. Todd said. In 2004, Microsoft was found guilty of abusing the dominant strength of Windows to muscle in on other separate software markets, including the market for server operating systems. The 2004 ruling ordered Microsoft to disclose enough information about Windows to allow rival server software manufacturers, including Sun Microsystems and open-source companies like Red Hat, to design server operating systems that worked as well with computers that run Windows as Microsoft’s own server operating system. If the information provided by Microsoft does not satisfy the order, the company will face a fine of 3 million euros a day, backdated to July, Mr. Todd said. Microsoft said Thursday that it had met the July deadline. “The trustee and Microsoft have now completed the technical review and edits to the more than 100 documents, totaling 8,500 pages, that we submitted in July of this year, in accordance with the deadline established by the commission,” it said. It described the submission of technical documentation in July, and the revision process since then, as “an unprecedented undertaking involving over 300 engineers and technical writers at Microsoft.” Even if the information submitted Thursday is satisfactory, Microsoft may still face fines for the period between the July deadline and Thursday. “We’ll take a decision about this period of time in due course,” Mr. Todd said.",

    "source": "Red Wings Begin Finals in Same Way Last Season’s Ended <eos> DETROIT — Pittsburgh Penguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury felt as if he had some extra company after allowing two weird goals in a 3-1 Red Wings victory that opened the Stanley Cup finals Saturday night. “It felt like a full moon was over my end of the ice,” he said. Both of Fleury’s gaffes were the result of caroms off Joe Louis Arena’s famously lively end boards. His first faux pas came when Brad Stuart’s routine slap shot from the blue line caromed off those end boards, struck him in the rear end and dribbled into the net 13 minutes 38 seconds into the game to give Detroit a 1-0 lead. With a minute left in the second period and the score tied 1-1, embarrassing misfortune struck Fleury once more, again courtesy of the arena’s supercharged end boards. Brian Rafalski’s long shot sprang off the dashers to Johan Franzen at the side of the net, who centered the puck just as Fleury was diving headfirst back into position. The puck hit Fleury’s trailing leg, ricocheted 60 degrees into the net, and it was 2-1 for Detroit. “Yes, the boards here are quick — I’ll cogitate and see if I can do something about it,” said Fleury, whose first language is French. Fleury has not had the best of luck at this building. When he charged onto the ice before Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals last year, he stumbled comically and fell — a bad omen, it turned out, as the Red Wings won the opener and the series in six games. Fleury made it onto the ice without mishap for this year’s Game 1, and he played well over all, making 27 saves. Still, the rear-end-assisted goal he allowed to Stuart looked a lot like one he gave up to the Red Wings in last year’s finals. Asked Saturday about that full moon, Fleury smiled and said, “Hopefully, tomorrow it’ll be over the other end of the ice.” Penguins Coach Dan Bylsma said the Penguins knew about the lively boards and practiced for it. “That’s just the situation in this building,” he said. “If the shooting lanes are blocked, you try to shoot a little wide and hope that the rebound from the back boards comes out.” This was the first Stanley Cup finals rematch in 25 years. And except for the two odd goals, the Penguins had the edge in play, at least through the first 40 minutes. The Penguins scored their first goal at 18:37 of the first period when Detroit goalie Chris Osgood let the rebound of a Evgeni Malkin slap shot trickle away for Ruslan Fedotenko to bury, making it 1-1. The play started when the normally dependable defenseman Niklas Kronwall gave the puck away to Malkin in the Detroit zone. That was an encouraging sign for the Penguins, who were shut out in the first two games here last year. Osgood made some very good saves throughout the game, finishing with 31 over all. Early in the second period, he robbed Malkin on a 120-foot breakaway after Malkin got away with tripping Kronwall and stole the puck from him. Later in the period, he stopped Sidney Crosby, who shot a backhander after making a nifty spin move. He was also lucky, as when a Crosby shot in the third period hit the goalpost and landed on his back. Saves like those kept Detroit in the game until the Wings were able to break it open on the rookie Justin Abdelkader’s first career playoff goal in the third minute of the third period. That goal, from the line of Abdelkader, Ville Leino and Darren Helm, highlighted Detroit’s depth. They were playing because of the absence of Pavel Datsyuk, the Wings’ finalist for the Most Valuable Player award, who is out with a foot injury, and Kris Draper, their top face-off man, who is sidelined with a groin injury. Nicklas Lidstrom, the Wings’ talismanic defenseman and captain, was back in the lineup after missing the first two playoff games of his 17-season career and led all players with 24 minutes of ice time. Detroit also had defenseman Jonathan Ericsson back after he missed one game because of an emergency appendectomy on Wednesday. Despite the three small incisions in his abdomen, he played nearly 17 minutes. The game was chippy, as befits a Cup finals rematch. Crosby went out of his way to throw an open-ice shoulder check into Henrik Zetterberg, Detroit’s indefatigable two-way center who usually plays opposite him. Brooks Orpik jarred Marian Hossa, who left the Penguins after last season to play for Detroit because the Wings, Hossa said at the time, had a better chance of winning the Cup. On Thursday, Orpik said he wished Hossa was still with Pittsburgh, but that did not stop him from nailing him in open ice.",

    "source": "Corey Kluber, Indians’ Ace, Rises as Precisely as His Two-Seam Fastball Dips <eos> GOODYEAR, Ariz. — As the actor Will Ferrell skipped merrily from camp to camp last Thursday in a madcap Cactus League odyssey, the best pitcher in the American League worked stoically on a back field at the Cleveland Indians’ training complex. No numbers on the scoreboard, no paying customers, not even an umpire. Corey Kluber might smile if he watched Ferrell’s slapstick comedy. Kluber, his teammates insist, is a witty prankster. Last May, he wore a chicken costume in the outfield during batting practice. “Oh, he’s very sneaky,” Indians pitcher Zach McAllister said. “If there’s something going on, he’s probably got his hand in it somehow.” But after Thursday’s simulated game — a controlled setting to build innings, without the stress of competition — Kluber revealed nothing. He wore no expression. He looked neither happy nor irritated, speaking to a few reporters in monotone, the personification of the nickname some teammates wear on a T-shirt: Klubot. Kluber, 28, earned the A.L. Cy Young Award last season with robotic, methodical efficiency. A right-hander, he finished 18-9 with a 2.44 earned run average, 269 strikeouts and better advanced metrics than the runner-up, Felix Hernandez of the Seattle Mariners. He got the award at a banquet in New York in January. “It’s just sitting on a desk in my office,” Kluber said. “I haven’t found a good spot for it.” Yet Kluber has reason to be proud. He became the third Cleveland pitcher to post a season of at least 18 victories and 260 strikeouts and an E.R.A. below 2.50. The others were Bob Feller and Luis Tiant. That is impressive company for any pitcher, especially one in his first full major league season who was not even ranked as a top-10 prospect in the San Diego farm system in 2010. That was when the Indians acquired him in a three-way trade that sent pitcher Jake Westbrook to St. Louis. “I don’t worry about what people predicted my career path to be,” said Kluber, who was drafted in the fourth round from Stetson University. “That’s kind of a waste to do that. I think it’s better off to just focus on what you can do now to improve in the future. I don’t think looking back makes much sense.” Looking forward did not interest him much, either, beyond generalities, but the Indians do not pay Kluber to talk. They pay him — not very much, actually — to pitch, and they thought he was intriguing enough to pluck from the Padres’ Class AA team for Westbrook. (San Diego got outfielder Ryan Ludwick from the Cardinals.) “What we try to do is identify those attributes that we think have a chance to lead to success,” said Chris Antonetti, the Indians’ general manager. “In Corey’s case, he’s a big, physical starting pitcher with good stuff, had a track record of success in terms of missing bats — he was leading the league in strikeouts at the time — and our reports were really good on his makeup and work ethic.” Kluber, who is listed as 6 feet 4 inches, advanced to Class AAA soon after the trade but struggled there the next season, with a 5.56 E.R.A. and more than four walks per nine innings. He relieved three times for Cleveland in September 2011, but he began the next two seasons in the minors. Kluber refined his skills on the farm, working diligently on a sinking two-seam fastball that one day would devastate major league hitters and make his cutter and curveball even more effective. But mastering the pitch took time. “Guys are in the minor leagues for a reason, and his was fastball command,” said Mickey Callaway, the Indians’ pitching coach and their former minor league coordinator. “And with stuff like that and throwing the ball over the plate, you don’t know when that’s going to come. It could be four years. It could never come.” Success came for Kluber midway through the 2013 season. He went 8-1 in his final 16 starts, and last spring Manager Terry Francona predicted a breakthrough. Kluber had gotten on a roll, and Francona believed his competitive drive would sustain it. As last season went on, Francona said, Kluber rarely shook off a sign from catcher Yan Gomes. He had total trust in the two-seamer. “When you have that good stuff and you throw it with conviction, even if it may not be the right pitch, it probably is,” Francona said. “He went one outing where Gomer wanted to establish his fastball, and he was locating it. I don’t think he threw an off-speed pitch until the ninth hitter of the game. And he just said: ‘I never really thought anything. Gomer put it down, so I threw it.’ ” Francona said he was pleased to see a younger Indians starter, Trevor Bauer, finding a similar rhythm with Gomes this spring and pouring strikes into the zone. Bauer is one of several starters in the Indians’ boom-or-bust rotation who could be poised to blossom, and he is using Kluber’s two-seamer as a template. At one point last season, Bauer asked Kluber if he could stand behind him in the bullpen and film his practice session. Kluber agreed, and Bauer — who chose his angle to best view Kluber’s release point — said he captured his teammate in 240, 480 and 1,000 frames per second. Bauer watched the film, and other clips he collected of Toronto’s Marcus Stroman, who has a similar two-seamer, and studied the footage as part of his off-season routine, watching it on a loop three out of every five days once he started throwing on Nov. 1. Bauer said Kluber’s two-seamer, which averages 93 miles an hour, veered eight inches down and in to a righty, and he spotted it with such precision that it perfectly set up his curveball, if hitters got that far. “He puts a lot of pressure on the hitter to swing the bat,” Bauer said, “because I noticed toward the end of the year, a lot of guys were going up there and swinging really early in the count, almost like they were in defensive mode from the beginning. There was an intimidation factor you could see.” Bauer said his own version was a work in progress — inconsistent, but coming along. For years, that also described Kluber’s career, and his late development has kept him from cashing in on his Cy Young Award. Kluber was not eligible for salary arbitration this season and will make only $601,000 on a one-year deal. The Indians traded their last two Cy Young winners — C. C. Sabathia and Cliff Lee — before they reached free agency, getting outfielder Michael Brantley for Sabathia and starter Carlos Carrasco for Lee. They are in no rush to move Kluber, who cannot be a free agent until after the 2018 season. “I’m not talking about that,” Kluber said when asked about the possibility of a long-term contract, and the answer was predictable. The Klubot is not programmed to discuss such matters, or to elaborate on much of anything. He is programmed, simply, to dominate. It was a long-running script, but it is finally up and running.",

    "source": "Reaching Back 2,000 Years to Unravel a Curse <eos> A vegetable seller named Babylas was the target of an alarming curse nearly 2,000 years ago. Written on a lead tablet found in Antioch, one of the largest cities in the Roman Empire, the curse calls on the gods to tie up the hapless greengrocer, then “drown and chill” his soul. The curse is described in the German journal Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik by Alexander Hollmann, a classicist at the University of Washington who studies Greek and Roman magic. The curse was written on both sides of the tablet. One side calls upon the god Iao to bind Babylas; the other side addresses multiple gods and calls for the tablet to be thrown down and “killed” in a well — followed, in the same way, by Babylas. “It also shows where he lives,” Dr. Hollmann said. “It’s all sort of designed so the gods know exactly where to find him.” Although the author of the curse is not mentioned in the writing, Dr. Hollmann speculates that it may have been a rival businessman. “This is a pretty serious curse,” he said. “And we have other evidence that these kinds of practices went on.” The tablet was found in a well in the 1930s, presumably the same one it was dropped in. Since then, along with many other items excavated from Antioch, which lies near Turkey’s Syrian border, the tablet has been at the Princeton University Art Museum. Curse tablets like this one have shown up in Rome, in Carthage in Africa and throughout the ancient Mediterranean region, said Dr. Hollmann, who has deciphered one other such tablet from Antioch and is working on six others. “They are so similar, because professionals were using magic books that circulated,” he said. “These had templates that were used for hundreds of years.”",

    "source": "1922 Theater Reopens to a Rock Beat <eos> MONTCLAIR AS the headliner reopening the Wellmont Theater here on Tuesday night, the rock band Counting Crows displayed their usual laid-back style. But the process of turning the old Art Deco theater into a performance venue in the heart of Montclair’s congested downtown was not without its hectic moments. Take opening night, originally scheduled for last Monday. Hours before the curtain was to go up, promoters sent out the word, by e-mail, on line and on the radio, that the show had been postponed by a day, explaining that Counting Crows’ lead singer, Adam Duritz, was ill. The concert went off mostly without a hitch the next day; the opening act, Wild Sweet Orange, played a couple of extra numbers, and Counting Crows were a bit late taking the stage. But more than 1,300 people eventually pumped their fists to favorites like “Round Here” and the opening number, “A Long December.” An hour before show time, a battalion of security officers was directing a convoy of concertgoers in S.U.V.’s, and traffic was flowing smoothly in an area known to wear down would-be diners and moviegoers seeking a coveted parking space. Back in September, Joseph Hartnett, chief executive of the municipality, said, “Keeping all of these people moving is going to be a challenge in an already parking-challenged town.” As it turned out, concertgoers said parking was less an issue than other factors, at least on a Tuesday evening when the theater was not filled to capacity. “There’s ample parking on the street — I had no problem at all,” said Chris Kunstadter, 53, of Bloomfield. Mr. Kunstadter received e-mail notification of the postponement in time to avoid heading out on Monday, but when he made it inside on Tuesday, he had a different concern. “They should have seating on the lower level,” he said, referring to the capacious open space near the main stage, where clumps of concertgoers convened. For this concert, seats were available only on the Wellmont’s upper tier. “On the Web site, it shows a seating plan” for the lower level, Mr. Kunstadter said. The theater’s managers say they will be bringing in seats for certain shows. Shawn Savage, 26, of Wanaque, complained that the Wellmont’s three bars were charging “Manhattan prices” for beer: “They could bring it down a buck or two,” he said. Nancy Livingston, 39, of Bloomfield, called the theater’s interior “industrial and unfinished-looking.” Most recently a movie triplex, the Wellmont dates to 1922. In comments on the Web site Baristanet, some other concertgoers complained that it was chilly inside. The theater, which accommodates up to 2,500, secured 800 parking spots in three lots several days before the opening. The deal was struck by Andy Feltz, 50, of Montclair Entertainment LLC, a new concert promotion company in partnership with the Bowery Presents, a New York-based group that owns the Bowery Ballroom and Mercury Lounge. Mr. Feltz ran the Beacon Theater in Manhattan from 1986 to 2006 and is currently presiding over shows at the United Palace Theater, also in Manhattan. “My kids go to school here,” he said. “I’m not going to do anything to upset the town.” The Wellmont’s lineup of boldface names on the way already includes Al Green, Steely Dan, Brian Wilson and John Legend. “I think it’s unreal that we’re getting this kind of venue in Montclair, which is mostly just a town of restaurants and stores,” said Chris Castellani, 33, a Montclair resident and operator of the blog MusicSnobbery. “Probably a lot of people are going to discover that Montclair is a cool place to come and hang out.” The Wellmont’s booker, Anthony Makes, 40, who used to secure bands for the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles, said anyone who thinks that he will be bringing in staid acts for an audience of stiff suburbanites should reconsider the surroundings. “It’s pretty hip around here,” Mr. Makes said, noting that ticket sales for more under-the-radar bands like the Decemberists were already brisk. “This is an audience that knows music.”",

    "source": "Starboard Value, Taking Stake in Perrigo, Looks to Make Another Big Investment Pay <eos> The hedge fund that helped prod Yahoo into selling its core business has found a new target for its brand of shareholder activism: the drug maker Perrigo. The fund, Starboard Value, has taken a 4.6 percent stake in the pharmaceutical company and has urged it to take steps to bolster its sagging stock price, according to a letter sent to Perrigo’s board. In the letter , Starboard pointed out the steep drop in Perrigo shares since the drug maker rebuffed a takeover bid last year by a fellow pharmaceutical company, Mylan. That bid was valued around $205 a share at the time. Shares of Perrigo have fallen more than 50 percent during the last 12 months, closing on Friday at $88.71. According to Starboard, Perrigo has mismanaged its core business of generic over-the-counter medicine and has failed to deliver on promises it made during its defense against the bid from Mylan. Starboard also complained about bonuses that Perrigo executives received after successfully fending off Mylan. “We believe that Perrigo trades at a significant discount to fair value and that there is substantial value to be created at Perrigo for the benefit of all its shareholders,” Jeffrey C. Smith, Starboard’s chief executive, wrote in the letter. “However, these are challenging times for Perrigo, and we strongly believe that material change is necessary.” In a statement on Monday, Perrigo said that it “will review the letter carefully and looks forward to a constructive and productive dialogue with Starboard — as we do with all of our shareholders — while we execute on a number of strategic and operational initiatives.” Perrigo’s case will be led in part by its chief executive of only a few months, John Hendrickson. His predecessor and the architect of the defense against Mylan, Joseph C. Papa, left for the drug maker Valiant Pharmaceuticals International this year. Since assuming his post, Mr. Hendrickson has criticized Mr. Papa’s tenure at Perrigo, arguing that the company’s “recent track record of performance against our own expectations is unacceptable.” Starboard’s 4.6 percent stake makes it the company’s third-biggest shareholder, behind the mutual fund giants Vanguard and Capital Research, according to regulatory filings.",

Bryant became the youngest to pass 27,000 career points but could not spark the Lakers, who have lost four of seven. “Is it the playoffs yet?” Lakers Coach Phil Jackson said. “No.” Boston, which has won 8 of 10, showed off a complete offensive game, outrebounding the Lakers by 43-30, hitting nine 3-pointers and getting 34 assists. “We knew we could run on L.A.,” Rajon Rondo said. “L.A., given the personnel that we have, we thought we could outrun them.” Garnett was cut near his left temple in the second quarter after Pau Gasol swiped his hand at him.

    "source": "W.N.B.A.’s Liberty Receiving Little Face Time on MSG <eos> The Liberty is fading from television. Two years ago, the MSG Network carried 26 Liberty games. Last year, it televised 14. This season the Liberty, 3-4 and last in the W.N.B.A.’s Eastern Conference, have appeared once. The next four or five Liberty games on MSG will be televised as a part, which is unspecified by the Garden, of the team’s new Foxwoods casino sponsorship. MSG has not yet scheduled dates for the games. This shift in priorities at a media company like Madison Square Garden is astonishing. The Garden owns the MSG Network and the Liberty. The network has needed spring and summer programming since the Mets left to start SNY after the 2005 season. But even as the presence of the Liberty, whose games are lower rated than the Mets’ were, has decreased, MSG is carrying 22 Red Bulls soccer games. That’s 22 games of a team the Garden does not own versus five or six of a team it does own. And it’s not as if the Red Bulls are a drastically bigger draw than the Liberty or that MSG is paying a big rights fee to carry the games. In a Red Bulls-Liberty rating comparison, we see a difference between tiny and teensy-weensy. MSG’s eight Red Bulls this season have averaged a 0.14 rating, or 10,490 households; the Liberty’s 14 games last year on MSG averaged a 0.1 rating, or 7,493 households. Scott O’Neil, the president of Madison Square Garden Sports, conceded that the company was saving money by carrying fewer Liberty games. He said it was better to reach Liberty fans by streaming its games, using a technology that is cheaper than the $35,000 to $50,000 price tag for a traditional game broadcast. O’Neil said, “W.N.B.A. fans tell us, ‘We want access where we want it and how we want it,’ and the most prudent way to reach the most fans is with WNBA Live Access,” the league’s year-old streaming service. Let’s dispense with the Garden needing to save money by slashing TV access to the Liberty (unless it is looking to sell the team). The Garden had earnings of $27.7 million in 2009 and $17.4 million in the first quarter this year. No one expects the Garden to be profligate. But shareholders of this newly spun-off public company should wonder why MSG paid to produce all those clearing-the-salary-cap Knicks games the last two seasons, which should have been relegated to streaming. And who needed to see those Isiah Thomas-coached seasons in high definition? Streaming sports is increasingly common and is becoming increasingly important as an option for laptop and mobile users who do not want to be tethered to their televisions. Understood. It is a great and viable screen alternative to the stationary television. But it is not yet the mass medium television is. O’Neil, who called WNBA Live Access spectacular, said that “the most important thing for us is to make sure the game is accessible to our fans.” But slashing TV coverage does not achieve that goal regardless of the technical sophistication of Liberty fans. “We want to reach the most fans in the most efficient way,” he added. He subverted his argument by saying streaming brings in “different fans than TV.” If that is true, MSG should augment a streaming strategy with one that restores a majority of the home games to MSG. The Garden is bucking a trend in the W.N.B.A. Last year, 61 of the league’s games were carried locally by the 13 teams’ television outlets, Donna Orender, the W.N.B.A. president, said. This season, the figure is 130 games despite the Garden’s cuts. (Forty-one of those games are simulcast on NBA TV.) Another 18 games are carried nationally on ESPN2. “We’ve made it a real focus to broaden our local TV exposure,” Orender said. “There are 20-plus games in Chicago. Eighteen to 20 in Atlanta. This is good for our fans.” She praised the Garden’s efforts to improve the Liberty and declined to criticize MSG’s reduction of the team’s telecasts directly. “As a league, we’re focusing on maximizing our exposure in every delivery option we can,” she said. Rebecca Lobo , a former Liberty star, said that when MSG carried 26 of her team’s games, “it was unheard of; most teams had five, six or seven.” She added, “It was great for fans and you would like to see them continue to carry them.” Lobo, now a W.N.B.A. and college basketball analyst at ESPN, said, “The positive is you can watch the games streamed on WNBA.com , with fairly good quality.” But, she said, an ESPN or MSG broadcast is better. The concept that the Garden would deny one of its own teams broad TV exposure seems bewildering. But not to O’Neil. “We’re fully aligned” at the Garden, he said. “We’re making the best decisions. This decision went through a healthy debate, and one of the waves of the future is online growth.”",

    "source": "Guidant Debated Device Peril <eos> Six months before the Guidant Corporation publicly disclosed short circuits in its heart devices, a debate may have been going on within the company over whether to alert doctors about such failures, internal company documents released yesterday suggest. The documents appear to indicate that some Guidant executives recommended in January 2005 that the company find a way to tell doctors about the failures posed by a device known as the Contak Renewal, an advanced heart defibrillator. The records, which were disclosed yesterday as part of a court proceeding in Texas, include handwritten notes said to have been composed by a top Guidant executive. Guidant started receiving a small but growing number of reports of short circuits in Contak Renewals in late 2004, more than two years after it discovered a similar problem in another defibrillator, the Prizm 2 DR. The Guidant records suggest that company executives came close to alerting doctors about the Contak Renewal last January, but that some officers opposed the idea. The company also conducted tests on the device. One executive later reported that the unit's failure rate was not as bad as first feared, the documents show. Because the records are handwritten notes, it is not clear whether the \"recommendation\" in them refers directly to the Contak Renewal, though that appears to be the case. Asked specifically about the issue, Guidant declined to comment or explain. In a statement, the company said, \"As the documents reflect, the company took responsible action during an ongoing investigation of Renewal and Renewal 2.\" It also noted it had \"aggressively evaluated product performance and communication thresholds.\" Guidant publicly disclosed problems with the Prizm 2 DR and the Contak Renewal last spring after it came under scrutiny. Seven people are known to have died in connection with short circuits in the devices; five deaths have involved a Contak Renewal or a related model known as the Contak Renewal 2. But the number of deaths is probably higher because physicians only recently became aware of the problem. Defibrillators electrically interrupt potentially lethal heart rhythms, and short circuits can render them useless. Guidant has said the number of reports it received did not warrant an earlier physician alert. At a minimum, the disclosure of the new Guidant documents is likely to fuel efforts to develop industrywide standards about when and how doctors and patients should be informed by heart device makers about malfunctions. A report by a committee formed by Guidant is due out in March, and a medical group, the Heart Rhythm Association, plans to issue recommendations in May. The documents released yesterday also include a slide presentation, which is hand-dated Oct. 20, 2004. It contains a projection, apparently made at that time, indicating that as many as 55 Contak Renewal units could short-circuit by November 2005. \"If we would communicate, what would it be?\" a handwritten note on the slide states. \"Start thinking and working on it now (Contingency).\" But the records could also mean more legal problems for Guidant, which is the subject of a takeover battle between Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson. Guidant is also under investigation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Justice Department. The records released in Texas yesterday are among hundreds of documents provided by Guidant to plaintiffs' lawyers in connection with a product liability lawsuit filed against it in a state court. The records were initially produced under seal, but yesterday the case's presiding judge, Judge Jack Hunter of State District Court, citing a Texas state law barring the sealing of court records related to safety issues, ordered a few pages of internal Guidant records released. He also set the stage for the potential release of more documents; late yesterday, Guidant received a stay of that ruling pending an appeal. On Wednesday, The New York Times had filed a motion in the case seeking the release of any records related to public health and safety. Guidant first told doctors last May about short circuits in the Prizm 2 after it learned that The Times was about to publish a report on the device. In June, it recalled the Prizm 2 DR, the Contak Renewal and the Contak Renewal 2. The records ordered released in Texas by Judge Hunter yesterday consist of three pages of handwritten notes and seven other pages that reproduce the slide presentation. Bob Hilliard, a plaintiff lawyer in Corpus Christi who is suing Guidant on behalf of two patients, said in an interview that the handwritten notes and slides were recently given to him at the end of a pretrial deposition of J. Frederick McCoy Jr., the head of Guidant's cardiac device unit. Mr. Hilliard said that the handwriting in the notes resembled handwriting that Mr. McCoy identified during the deposition as his own. It could not be determined yesterday if Mr. McCoy had written the notes. The notes, dated June 22, 2005, appear to be an annotated timeline that reconstructs company events and decisions involving several issues, including the Contak Renewal, over the course of about two years. In an entry dated Jan. 7, 2005, the chronology notes a \"recommendation,\" which followed several reports of electrical failures. \"If we can a find a way to communicate on this trend in such a way that it would help physicians manage patients and does not result in patient harm via undue concern, then we should communicate,\" the entry reads. The same entry noted that at least one executive was \"not on board with this recommendation.\" In the wake of Guidant's disclosures last year, many heart specialists have said that they want to know about significant device failure so they, rather than manufacturers, can decide whether the units need to be replaced. Apart from its statement, Guidant declined to comment on any aspect on the documents. In a recent update to doctors in December, the company projected, based on laboratory testing, that 35 Contak Renewals had short-circuited. The slide presentation also contains descriptions of the electrical problem, photographs and a chart comparing the Contak Renewal failure to that of the Prizm 2 DR.",

    "source": "Task Force Recommends Improvements for Nuclear Plants <eos> WASHINGTON — The Fukushima Daiichi meltdowns show that it is time for “redefining the level of protection that is regarded as adequate” at American nuclear plants, a special task force of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has concluded. The task force recommendations were to be released Wednesday, but a copy of the summary was obtained Tuesday evening by The New York Times. It lays out numerous areas for improvement, based on the experience in Japan after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. American plants need to plan for simultaneous accidents at adjacent reactors, something they have never done, the task force said. They also need to make sure that the “hardened vents” added to reactors over the years to prevent hydrogen explosions would actually work in an emergency, the report said, and determine where hydrogen, which is produced by overheated fuel, might flow. Japanese operators had trouble using the vents, resulting in the explosions in the secondary containments. Some of the improvements the industry voluntarily adopted after the Sept. 11 attacks have not been regularly inspected or maintained, the report said. Those should be inspected using the more “formal” procedures that are in place for the plants’ original safety equipment, the task force recommended. And plants should have a better way to add water to spent fuel pools and monitor conditions in those pools, the task force said. Fukushima focused new attention on spent fuel pools, which usually have more radioactive materials in them than the reactors do. In desperation, the Japanese used water cannons to refill them. Even now, the task force wrote, there was uncertainty about what happened at Fukushima, and information was “unavailable, unreliable or ambiguous because of damage to equipment at the site and because the Japanese response continues to focus on actions to stop the ongoing radioactive release.” The five-member commission is scheduled to meet next week to consider the work of the task force, which it considers a quick, first look at the Fukushima disaster’s relevance to reactors in the United States.",

In an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Bloomberg wrote, “Progress on the redevelopment of the World Trade Center has been frustratingly slow, owing in large part to a multilayered governance structure that has undermined accountability from the get-go.” But while Mr. Bloomberg’s piece took the state to task for the delays, his remedies were not strikingly different from what officials with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have already publicly advocated, including speeding up construction of the memorial and simplifying the $2.5 billion transportation center and PATH train terminal. The Port Authority, which is overseeing the redevelopment plan, is expected to make those recommendations and others in a report to be released on Sept. 29. The authority is not, however, likely to propose disbanding the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation as Mr. Bloomberg has demanded. The Bloomberg administration, through Deputy Mayor Robert Lieber, has been involved with the committee working on that report, which will lay out a new budget and timetable for the reconstruction. Last week, Mr. Lieber praised the work of the development corporation at a meeting of its board. Reactions to Mr. Bloomberg’s article differed sharply. Julie Menin, chairwoman of Community Board 1, which includes ground zero, applauded the mayor’s demand that the memorial be completed by Sept. 11, 2011. But Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, whose district includes Lower Manhattan, said that he opposed the mayor’s call for eliminating the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, because it helped coordinate the city, state and federal agencies involved in reconstruction. “I’m glad the mayor understands finally how important it is to get this rebuilding effort off the ground,” Mr. Silver said in an interview. Reactions from Gov. David A. Paterson and the Port Authority were more muted. In a statement released on Wednesday, the governor said, “The mayor and I share a sense of disappointment and frustration at the unacceptable pace of the ground zero rebuilding, which has never had a realistic timetable or budget — an absolute necessity for undertaking construction of this scale.” The Port Authority, which owns the 16-acre site and is responsible for building the transit hub and the Freedom Tower, also declined to comment on the mayor’s recommendations. Stephen Sigmund, an authority spokesman, said, “The point of the report we are doing is to make decisions on exactly these tough issues and move on to getting every project on the site completed as quickly as possible.” Mr. Bloomberg’s criticisms, which came on the eve of the seventh anniversary of the attack, are hardly novel; he and others have made many of them before. And Governor Paterson earlier this year ordered the authority to devise more realistic timetables for the rebuilding effort. At that time, state, city and Port Authority officials already had a thick internal report indicating that rebuilding was hopelessly off schedule and over budget. In June, Christopher Ward, the Port Authority’s executive director, said that the memorial’s plaza, tree-lined park, waterfalls and below-ground spaces would be completed by the 10th anniversary. But he said it was unlikely that the museum would be completed by then or that the public would have full access, because the surrounding area would still be a construction site. The authority for some time has also been hinting that it would simplify the transportation center, designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The center’s mezzanine lies directly under part of the memorial plaza, so its framework must be completed nearly to street level by July 2010 to guarantee that the memorial opens on Sept. 11, 2011, said Joseph C. Daniels, president of the memorial and museum. Many officials have repeatedly articulated one of Mr. Bloomberg’s central complaints: that the rebuilding effort has been plagued by a thick web of competing bureaucracies. There are 19 public agencies, two private developers, 101 construction contractors and 33 designers, architects and consulting firms involved in the process. Gov. George E. Pataki created the development corporation in late 2001 to oversee the rebuilding of ground zero. Although Mr. Bloomberg has appointed half its board, he has viewed it as a state agency that often fails to act in the city’s best interest. His concerns led to the joint creation, with Governor Pataki, of another agency, the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center. The command center was initially supposed to coordinate all construction activity in Lower Manhattan. James A. Parrott, deputy director of the nonprofit Fiscal Policy Institute, was part of a coalition of labor union and community organization officials who called for the abolition of the development corporation in 2003. But they were rebuffed by the mayor, he said. In remarks to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg defended his demands, saying, “I would assume that everybody at the state level would try to do exactly what’s right: this is a sacred site, this is part of NYC, this is part of America.”",

    "source": "Residents Abandon Daraya as Government Seizes a Symbol of Syria’s Rebellion <eos> BEIRUT, Lebanon — Hundreds of rebel fighters and their families left a long-besieged suburb of the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Friday, under an agreement with the government that amounted to an opposition surrender of territory and a symbolic defeat. Carrying their belongings in suitcases and overstuffed plastic bags, residents filed out from between rows of destroyed buildings to board buses that would take them from the town of Daraya to rebel-held Idlib Province, a place about 200 miles north that few of them have ever seen. Thousands more civilians are to leave for other government-held suburbs of Damascus in the coming days under the deal that hands the town to the government. Few of Daraya’s residents hold out any hope of returning. As they prepared to evacuate Friday, residents kissed the ground and visited the graves of relatives for the last time. The scene was reminiscent of the evacuation of rebels and civilians from the old city of Homs two years ago, an area that remains largely deserted today. Daraya, like Homs, has been a symbol of revolt since the earliest peaceful protests against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011: Leaders of the civilian opposition hailed from Daraya, and many of them were imprisoned, with some tortured to death while in custody. The ultimate fall of the rebellious town now symbolizes the failure of the moderate opposition rooted there and those affiliated with the early civilian protests to firmly unite fractured rebel groups. Isolated by government blockades for four years and bombarded relentlessly, Daraya stood out as a place where the main rebel groups remained under local control and not affiliated with extremist factions. Because it lies close to a military airport and is less than two miles from downtown Damascus — and also perhaps because it represented an alternative to government authority and the rule of extremists affiliated with the Islamic State or Al Qaeda — government forces had been determined to take the town. Its fall will free up hundreds of pro-government fighters for other battles. Image Many Daraya residents were taken by bus on to Idlib Province, a rebel-held area about 200 miles north. Credit Associated Press “The regime will keep Daraya empty, dead land, as a graveyard,” said Abu Mohammad, 60, who left Daraya four years ago for the government-held suburb of Sahnaya, and asked to use his nickname for fear his family in Daraya would be subject to reprisals. On Friday, he and his wife sat glued to their television set watching coverage of the evacuation, hoping for a glimpse of four of their children, whom they have not seen since the couple fled Daraya. Their children — two sons fighting with the local rebels and two daughters married to fighters — are leaving for Idlib, where hard-line Islamist groups wield power and government and Russian warplanes strike daily. A few blocks away in Sahnaya, a pro-government fighter who uses the nom de guerre Abu Odai exulted in the victory, saying that many young men from Sahnaya had died in the battles and that until now he had been afraid that fighters from Daraya would harm his family. Still, he asked that his real name not be used out of fear his family would be harmed and because he was speaking without authorization from his commanders. “The government told the armed groups in Daraya for years to hand over their arms and stay peacefully in their towns, but they refused and called for freedom,” he said. “Today they got their freedom by going to Idlib.” The United Nations, which closely monitored the evacuation of Homs in 2014, was not able to oversee the exodus from Daraya. U.N. officials said on Friday that they had only been informed overnight of the plans to allow residents to leave. “It is tragic that repeated appeals to lift the siege of Daraya, besieged since November 2012, and cease the fighting, have never been heeded,” the United Nations’ special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said in a statement. “It is imperative that people of Daraya are protected in any evacuation that takes place, and that this takes place voluntarily.” But local council members in Daraya said that government negotiators had given them no real choice, instead offering an ultimatum as the rebels ran out of ammunition: Leave or be wiped out. The evacuation came as Secretary of State John Kerry and the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, met in Geneva in what officials described as a renewed effort between the United States, which backs parts of the opposition, and Russia, which backs the Syrian government, to map out a political transition that could end the war. After a long day of talks in a hotel overlooking Lake Geneva, Mr. Kerry told reporters that he and Mr. Lavrov had “achieved clarity on the path forward” and agreed on the “vast majority” of technical issues holding up progress toward ceasing hostilities and creating the space needed to restart talks on a political solution. But the two diplomats said their discussions still left unresolved a number of issues that they declined to detail. American and Russian experts would continue negotiations in Geneva in the coming week in an effort to produce a deal that could help kick-start deliveries of humanitarian aid and pave the way for a resumption of political transition talks. That did not mean the Assad government would halt its airstrikes, Mr. Lavrov made clear, but it would make them “more efficient” in targeting terrorist groups. But the Syrian government has long sought to undermine the transition process, preferring a “starve or kneel” strategy — named for slogans scrawled by pro-government militiamen outside besieged areas — and negotiating individual surrender deals with rebel groups rather than pursuing an overall settlement. The government strategy has yielded mixed results: fighting has quieted in many areas but other agreements have fallen apart, leading to renewed clashes. The failure to end the widespread and debilitating conflict has also been abetted by the inability or unwillingness of opposition groups — and their international backers — to unite, politically or militarily, firmly against Mr. Assad. The attention of some rebel groups and their United States backers have shifted to battling the Islamic State group. Image Syrian soldiers in Daraya on Friday. The fall of Daraya will free up hundreds of pro-government troops for other battles. Credit Youssef Badawi/European Pressphoto Agency There were angry recriminations on Friday from some rebels against American-backed opposition commanders in southern Syria who, following their backers’ instructions, have refrained from major offensives against pro-government forces in recent months. That decision has freed the government and allied militias to focus on dislodging rebels from the suburbs around Damascus, such as Daraya. For years, the town was under siege, receiving just two small international aid deliveries permitted by the Syrian government while undergoing near-daily bombardments. Residents of Daraya held out after a massacre of hundreds of people by pro-government militias four years ago, on August 25, 2012, and suffered the effects of one of the government’s deadly sarin attacks in August 2013 that killed more than 1,000 people in several Damascus suburbs. The United States had declared the use of chemical weapons to be a “red line” in the conflict, but rather than retaliate, Washington instead struck a deal with Russia to remove the government’s chemical weapons. Since that decision, an emboldened Syrian government has stepped up attacks on residential areas, and a confidential United Nations report found that the government continued to carry out chemical attacks with chlorine. Around 8,000 of the 80,000 people who lived in Daraya before the war remain. Evacuation buses Friday were escorted by volunteers from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent. Rebels were allowed to take their personal weapons. Civilian activists said they, too, were choosing to go to Idlib because they feared anyone who had taken part in protests against Mr. Assad would be subject to arrest in government areas. In Sahnaya on Friday, where residents have become used to the reverberations of bombardments on Daraya, there was an unfamiliar quiet. Abu Mohammad, who had farmed grapes and vegetables on the outskirts of Daraya when he lived there, teared up as he watched on television as his former neighbors abandoned what was left of their homes. His wife leaned forward, her face draped in a long white head scarf, close to the screen. “This is my daughter,” she said, then corrected herself. “No, she is not — someone who looks like her. All Daraya’s families are related, and they look alike.” She dabbed her eyes with a napkin. “Oh God,” she said, “let me meet with my sons and daughters for one hour and then die, to be buried in Daraya’s soil.”",

    "source": "It's a Whole New Ballgame in Ireland, and a Movie, Too <eos> The plucky crusade to introduce baseball to Ireland ignited because of a bumper sticker. Mike Kindle, an American who moved to Ireland in 1990, saw an Irish Softball Association sticker on a car and begged the driver to tell him where he could find the group. He prayed it was no joke. Kindle found the co-ed softball players tossing high-arc pitches on a mushy field. Softball was obviously a recreational activity, like flipping a Frisbee. The discovery still motivated Kindle, who preferred the more serious style of hardball that he had left behind in San Diego. So Kindle persistently pushed the sport of baseball on a country without a single baseball diamond at the time. Eventually, there were about 30 regulars, some taking awkward swings, some making tortured throws and most, they said, falling in love with baseball and the notion of possibly playing it for Ireland. \"We decided we should try and form an international team,\" Kindle said. \"We said, 'Let's get some uniforms and funding and go play.' We were sitting in the boozer over a couple of pints. Over a couple of pints, it sounded good.\" The story of the recent birth of baseball in Ireland, its growth and its baby steps in international competition is told in \"The Emerald Diamond,\" a film by John J. Fitzgerald. The film will be shown in 20 cities and towns throughout the United States, starting Feb. 25 at the Jacob Burns Film Center in Pleasantville, N.Y. Fitzgerald's movie is a charming look at how baseball captivated some dedicated Irishmen. Those young men, supplemented by American-born players who had a parent or grandparent born in Ireland, transformed themselves from bumbling weekend warriors into respected competitors. Think of Rudy, the Notre Dame walk-on, and multiply it by about a dozen. \"I found out about them and I said, 'This is amazing,' \" Fitzgerald said. \"I had no idea Ireland had a national team.\" The Irish are still minor players on the international scene and are not one of the 16 federations competing in the inaugural World Baseball Classic next month. While Ireland won the bronze medal in the B Pool of the 2004 European Championships, the 10-year-old Irish team remains a baseball neophyte. But Fitzgerald said some players dreamily speak about qualifying for the next classic or the one after that. The team has playfully wondered if the Yankees' Derek Jeter, who has Irish roots on his mother's side, could be coaxed into playing for Ireland. That dream of Jeter wearing green would be impossible, though, since Jeter's grandmother was born in New Jersey. Before Fitzgerald decided to do a documentary on the Irish, he wanted to be on the team. Fitzgerald played one year of college baseball and thought he was eligible because his grandmother is a dual citizen. After four months of workouts, Fitzgerald found out that he was ineligible because his grandmother was born in New York, not Ireland. By then, Fitzgerald had communicated with the coaches of Baseball Ireland and heard about their humble start, their endless obstacles and their snippets of success. If Fitzgerald, a 28-year old from Valhalla, N.Y., could not play for Ireland, he wanted to follow the team with a camera and recount an intriguing, and mostly unknown, tale. \"Even now, when I talk to people from Ireland about the baseball team, they think I'm talking about hurling or an Irish-American team from the U.S.,\" Fitzgerald said. \"Outside of Dublin, no one has ever heard of it.\" Cormac Eklof, a pitcher who has a tattoo of Nomar Garciaparra, added, \"Nobody knows who we are.\" When Kindle, Eklof, Sean Mitchell, John Dillon, Darran O'Connor and some other originals initially played in Ireland, they trudged across rugby or soccer fields. There were no mounds, so the pitchers dug foot holes, and no backstops, so they hammered beams into the ground and attached netting. Rain was almost as predictable as the ball being white. They did have bases, which Eklof said were swiped from the softball team. The film shows scenes of players with choppy swings and players fielding balls as if they were catching shot-puts. The Irish were learning on the fly. Dillon, a strong rugby player, was 25 when he made his baseball debut, an age when many Americans have stopped playing. He has now been the starting center fielder for a decade, combining grit with grace. Ireland debuted in the 1996 European Championships and lost to the Czech Republic, 23-2, but the proud players were content because they had succeeded in at least competing. Losses to Norway (19-1), Poland (20-10) and Lithuania (15-5) followed, and exasperation bubbled. Could they be that terrible? The answer was no. Ireland stopped Yugoslavia, 8-6, in the final game, and the team was ecstatic and relieved. Still, to continue growing, the Irish needed a real place to play. Peter O'Malley, the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, helped make that a reality by donating$140,000 to build adult and youth fields that sit side by side in West Dublin. Some locals who did not know a double from a double play had to be reminded not to tear up the infield while practicing golf shots. The diamond gave Irish baseball a home and an identity. Ireland won two games in the 1998 European Championships and one in the 2000 tournament. By 2002, the Irish, who had followed the practice of other European teams by adding a few American-born college players who possessed dual citizenship, thought they were threats to win the title. They finished fourth. But, in 2004, with the additions of Joe Kealty, who hit .337 at Boston College; Chris Gannon, who was 11-4 for the same university; and Brendan Bergerson, an intimidating left-hander from the University of West Virginia, Ireland had its best team ever. The Irish beat Serbia-Montenegro to win a bronze medal. \"It feels like we've been on a good trip,\" said Chris Foy, who is from Seaford, N.Y., and moved to Dublin and joined the team in 2000. \"It took guts for the guys who were playing softball to pick up baseballs and say, 'Let's give this a try.' \" One of the greatest challenges for Ireland has been developing pitchers because the popular Irish sports, like hurling, soccer, rugby and Gaelic football, do not involve throwing balls. When Ireland adds talent from America, the focus is on pitchers. The Irish are also wary of keeping their team from becoming what Eklof called \"a bunch of ringers\" who could ruin team chemistry. So the roster is limited to one-third American-born players. As important as the national team is to the future, the current players are also concerned about having successors. Rory Murphy, a sturdy catcher, hit .538 as a 16-year old in the 2004 championships and is considered the premier prospect in Ireland. In a country where 300 children play baseball, that Murphy favors the new sport over rugby is a coup. \"We need to keep the kids coming,\" said Will Beglane, the youth director. \"If we don't do that, the national team will end.\" Several players will be in New York to see \"The Emerald Diamond\" before returning to prepare for the 2006 European Championships in August. The two top teams from the B Pool advance to A, and keener competition in 2007 against the likes of Italy and the Netherlands. If Ireland can indeed rumble into the A Pool after only a decade of international play, Kindle, the pioneer who spied the softball bumper sticker that helped inspire it all, thinks it would be time for Fitzgerald toplan a sequel. \"Even if I wasn't involved, I'd think it was a great story,\" Kindle said. \"You've got a bunch of knuckleheads running around playing in the rain because they love baseball. It's a writer's dream.\"",

    "source": "Reverberations as Door Slams on Hope of Change <eos> TEHRAN — It is impossible to know for sure how much the ostensible re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad represents the preference of an essentially conservative Iranian public and how much, as opposition voters passionately believe, it is the imposed verdict of a fundamentally authoritarian regime. But for those who dreamed of a gentler Iran , Saturday was a day of smoldering anger, crushed hopes and punctured illusions, from the streets of Tehran to the policy centers of Western capitals. Iranians who hoped for a bit more freedom, a better managed economy and a less reviled image in the world wavered between protest and despair on Saturday. On the streets around Fatemi Square, near the headquarters of the leading opposition candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi , riot police officers dressed in RoboCop gear roared down the sidewalks on motorcycles to disperse and intimidate the clots of pedestrians who had gathered to share rumors and dismay. “Another four years of dictatorship,” a voter muttered. “This is a coup d’état,” several others agreed. Some women wept openly. Some talked of “mutiny.” Others were more cynical. “It was just a movie,” said Hussein Gharibi, a 54-year-old juice vendor, scoffing at those who had gotten their hopes up. “They were all just players in a movie.” Far off, President Obama and other Western leaders who had seen a better relationship with Iran as potentially helpful in resolving the problems of Afghanistan , Iraq and nuclear proliferation faced the prospect of doing business with a man who, in addition to being a Holocaust-denying hard-liner, now stands suspected in a sham election. There were some important constituencies that took satisfaction from the outcome. Domestically, Mr. Ahmadinejad appealed to the fears of the more pious and poor who had found change unsettling. This included those alarmed by the days of political street carnival preceding the election and those (not just men) put off by Mr. Moussavi’s attention to the traditional, second-class role of women in this paternalistic quasi-theocracy. They were joined by the civil servants, police officers and pensioners who all enjoyed the incumbent’s oil-financed generosity to his base, by those who relished his name-naming attack on corruption and by those who took pride in his defiance of the West. Outside Iran, the result was comforting to hawks in Israel and some Western capitals who had feared that a more congenial Iranian president would cause the world to let down its guard against a country galloping toward nuclear weapons capability. (Mr. Moussavi, while promising a more conciliatory foreign policy, did not disavow the country’s nuclear-processing project, which Iran insists is for civilian ends alone.) “In fact, Moussavi will be more difficult to deal with, because he will be nicer,” one skeptical Western diplomat said on the eve of the vote. Among downcast Iranian journalists and academics, the chatter focused on why the interlocking leadership of clerics, military officers and politicians, without whose acquiescence little of importance happens, decided to stick with Mr. Ahmadinejad. Did they panic at the unexpected passion for change that arose in the closing weeks of the Moussavi campaign? Did Mr. Moussavi go too far in his promises of women’s rights, civil freedom and a more conciliatory approach to the West? Or was the surge an illusion after all, the product of wishful thinking? The optimists in Iran and abroad have to ask themselves whether the joyful ruckus that filled the streets represented a new popular force or just an opportunity to let off steam. While Iran is not quite the closed society many imagine — it is a nation of text messagers and Facebook users, with access to Persian-language BBC broadcasts and other independent voices — it is still a controlled society. On the street, the speculation focused more on how the election was manipulated, as many voters insisted it must have been for Mr. Ahmadinejad to score such a preposterous margin of victory. One version (from somebody’s brother who supposedly knew someone inside) had it that vote counters simply were ordered to doctor the numbers: “Make that 1,000 for Ahmadinejad a 3,000.” Others pointed out that the ballots seemed designed to lead opposition voters astray. Voters were obliged to choose a candidate and fill in a code. Though Mr. Moussavi was candidate No. 4, the code No. 44 signified Mr. Ahmadinejad. One employee of the Interior Ministry, which carried out the vote count, said the government had been preparing its fraud for weeks, purging anyone of doubtful loyalty and importing pliable staff members from around the country. “They didn’t rig the vote,” claimed the man, who showed his ministry identification card but pleaded not to be named. “They didn’t even look at the vote. They just wrote the name and put the number in front of it.” The government on Saturday insisted that the election was aboveboard and made it ominously clear that it would have little patience with anyone who questioned the purity of Iranian democracy. It was far from clear what recourse the opposition had left. Mr. Moussavi, who disappeared amid rumors that he was under house arrest or worse, sent word that there would be no turning back, but he did not say how he or his followers should challenge the outcome. The text messaging that is the nervous system of the opposition was shut down, along with universities, Web sites and newspapers the government regarded as hostile. Mr. Moussavi was not allowed a platform on Saturday and barely managed to get out a communiqué calling the election “a magic show.” Although there were bursts of defiance that were forcibly subdued, there was also a palpable fear; on Saturday, unlike on Friday, few opposition voters would let their names be used. “By the evening, people will pour into the streets,” predicted one young woman, from inside the hood of her black chador. “But Ahmadinejad will become president by force.”",

    "source": "Frantic Search for Survivors in Guatemala After Mudslide Kills 69 <eos> GUATEMALA CITY — Dulce del Carmen Lavarenzo Pu had just returned from church when the ground shook and she heard a terrible noise. A wave of mud slid from the nearby mountainside and buried everything just 150 feet from her house. “Everything went black, because the lights went out,” said Ms. Lavarenzo Pu, a 28-year-old homemaker, speaking of the mudslide that struck Thursday night in her neighborhood on the outskirts of Guatemala City. “Ash and dust were falling, so we left the house. You couldn’t see anything.” The rain-sodden hillside about 300 feet high had collapsed onto her neighborhood, killing at least 69 people, including a cousin of Ms. Lavarenzo Pu. She burst into tears upon seeing the body of her cousin brought into the morgue on Friday. At least 36 other people have been reported injured. The number of dead was expected to rise with family members reporting hundreds of people missing. The number of missing could be as high as 600 based on at least 100 homes in the area of the slide, said Alejandro Maldonado, executive secretary of Conred, Guatemala’s emergency disaster agency. Search efforts resumed at dawn on Saturday. Julio Sánchez, spokesman for Guatemala’s volunteer firefighters, said that workers had recovered four more bodies in the early morning, raising the death toll to 30. Hundreds of rescue workers used shovels, pickaxes, dogs and backhoes in a frantic bid to reach survivors on Friday, pulling one man alive from the rubble of his collapsed home more than 15 hours after the landslide hit. They had to call off the search late Friday until Saturday morning for workers’ security because they were getting tired and it was starting to rain, the authorities said. Mr. Sánchez said Friday that the dead, including two babies, were carried to an improvised morgue where weeping relatives identified the bodies of their loved ones. The dead included Quani Bonilla, 18, who played on the national squash team, he said. Also among the bodies, rescuers found a mother embracing her two girls, said Carlos Turcios, a doctor who saw them when he came to help the rescue. The hill that towers over Cambray, a neighborhood in the suburb of Santa Catarina Pinula, about 10 miles east of Guatemala City, partly collapsed onto a 200-foot stretch of the hamlet just before midnight, burying an estimated 68 homes. Raul Rodas, an assistant village mayor, said about 150 families had lived in the area where the mudslide occurred. Some of the untouched homes in Cambray, which sits on the edge of a small river, were abandoned by their owners for fear of further mudslides. Early in the day, Marleni Pu, 25, stood at the edge of the mudslide, her face swollen with weeping. “My uncles, my cousins, my nieces and nephews are all there,” she said, looking across the field of debris where about two dozen relatives had lived. “Six houses where my relatives lived are all under the hillside now.”",

He was 97. His daughter, Cricket Gentry, said he apparently died of a heart attack while watching the Belmont Stakes on television. She went to his house after the race, in which American Pharoah captured the Triple Crown, and found him in his chair in front of the TV. “It was like he had stood up and said, ‘Hooray!’ and then fell over,” said Ms. Gentry, who is a paramedic. Mr. Derr covered the Masters for CBS from 1956 to 1982. According to Golf Digest, he was a 17-year-old reporter for The Gaston Gazette in North Carolina when he went to a college football game and sat next to the sportswriter O. B. Keeler, who suggested he attend a new spring tournament at Augusta National Golf Club hosted by Bobby Jones. Mr. Derr went to the second Masters, in 1935, the year Gene Sarazen shot a 2 on the par-5 15th hole, helping to put the Masters on the map. Along the way, Mr. Derr forged relationships with some of golf’s giants, including Ben Hogan, Sam Snead and Byron Nelson. He wrote about his encounters in his third book, “My Place at the Table: Stories of Golf and Life” (2010).

    "source": "Lawyers for Barry Bonds Try to Exclude More Evidence <eos> With Barry Bonds ’s trial on federal perjury charges nearly two months away, his lawyers are making a renewed effort to exclude more of the government’s evidence from the case against him. Those efforts, set forth in court filings in San Francisco federal court about a week ago, could set up prosecutors for another significant setback to their longstanding effort to convict Bonds . He was indicted in 2008 on charges of lying to a grand jury in 2003 by denying he ever knowingly used steroids. “The government’s case has already been severely damaged by the court’s prior decision to exclude evidence,” said Mathew Rosengart, a partner at the Manatt, Phelps & Phillips law firm and a former federal prosecutor. “If the judge rules to exclude even more evidence, it could be another major blow, so the upcoming decision is crucial.” United States District Court Judge Susan Illston is expected to hear arguments next Friday and in early February regarding potential evidence that will be used in the trial, which is scheduled to start on March 21. Already, Illston has barred the prosecution from introducing several pieces of evidence against Bonds because his former trainer, Greg Anderson, has refused to testify before a grand jury or in court. According to Illston, that evidence — including two positive steroids tests that the prosecutors contend were Bonds’s and a log sheet from the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative that listed the positive results under Bonds’s name — is unusable at the trial unless Anderson testifies and establishes its authenticity. An appeals court subsequently agreed with her decision. Anderson and four other men pleaded guilty to illegal drug distribution in the Balco case, which involved dozens of professional and Olympic athletes. Anderson spent more than a year in jail for refusing to testify, and Bonds’s lawyers are taking full advantage of his resolve. In their recent filings, Bonds’s lawyers are trying to chip away at the government’s use of Anderson, this time asking Illston to exclude from the trial any mention of Anderson’s refusal to testify. They also have asked, yet again, for the judge to dismiss what is said to be a tape recording of a clubhouse conversation between Steve Hoskins, Bonds’s former business manager, and Anderson, in which Anderson acknowledged injecting Bonds. The judge has thrown out part of that conversation, but the defense wants it excluded completely. Allen Ruby, Bonds’s lead lawyer, declined to comment on the strategy. But Mark Geragos, Anderson’s lawyer, lauded the defense for being so aggressive in attacking the prosecution’s case. “It’s at that point where I think they won’t be able to get any of the documentary evidence in that mentions Greg Anderson, and I don’t think they could continue to try the case,” Geragos said, adding that the hearing next week would be a “potential make or break moment” for the government. “It looks to me that the case is fatally flawed from the prosecution standpoint and, at some point, I think they will pick up their gloves and bats and go home.” Some legal experts said it was unlikely prosecutors would move to dismiss the case, no matter how the judge rules on the evidence. The prosecutors, who declined to comment, have invested too much time and money in the case to turn away from it now, the experts said. Peter Keane, a professor at Golden Gate University School of Law, said the prosecutors would be reluctant to drop the case because of how such an abandonment would look to the public. “There is motivation to move forward when you have charges against someone like Bonds, who is such a big fish,” Keane said. “If prosecution just says we move to dismiss, a lot of people would get the idea that lying to a grand jury is something you can get away with.” Since Bonds testified before the grand jury more than seven years ago, four United States attorneys have overseen the matter. But the arrival of yet another top federal prosecutor in San Francisco — Melinda Haag, who was confirmed last August — will not deter the government’s case, experts said. Keane said Haag was unlikely to tell the prosecutors to give up on Bonds’s case because of how new she is to the job. “She actually has more invested in the case than the old U.S. attorney because one of the things she needs to do is maintain the respect of her line prosecutors, and that includes the ones who have been working on this case for years and years,” Keane said. “If she made the decision to walk away, that would damage her credibility with the people she relies on every day in the courts and would be terrible for the morale of that office.” In next week’s hearing, the prosecutors will argue why their evidence, particularly relating to Anderson, is important. They will try to persuade her to rule against Bonds’s lawyers in their effort to strike about a quarter of Bonds’s grand jury testimony, erasing all allusions to the evidence that Illston has already ruled inadmissible. They will also try to persuade Illston to allow testimony from athletes — six former and current Major League Baseball players and one former N.F.L. player — who have said they obtained steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs from Anderson. The government’s plan is to have those athletes describe how thorough Anderson was in helping them use performance-enhancing drugs. He gave them the drugs, instructed them on how to use them, discussed their effectiveness and advised them to keep calendars regarding their drug use, the prosecutors say. Bonds’s lawyers have asked Illston to bar those athletes from testifying.",

    "source": "S.E.C. Proposes Tighter Limits on Private Trading System <eos> WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal regulators are proposing tighter oversight for so-called dark pools, trading systems that do not publicly provide price quotes and compete with major stock exchanges. The Securities and Exchange Commission voted Wednesday to propose new rules that would require more stock quotes in the dark pool systems to be publicly displayed. The changes could be adopted sometime after a 90-day public comment period. The alternative trading systems, private networks that match buyers and sellers of large blocks of stocks, have grown explosively in recent years and now account for an estimated 7.2 percent of all share volume. S.E.C. officials have identified them as a potential emerging risk to markets and investors. The initiative is the latest action by the agency seeking to bring tighter oversight to the markets amid questions about transparency and fairness on Wall Street. The agency has floated a proposal restricting short-selling — or betting against a stock — in down markets. Last month, the agency proposed banning “flash orders,” which give traders a split-second edge in buying or selling stocks. A flash order refers to certain members of exchanges — often large institutions — buying and selling information about stock trades milliseconds before that information is made public. Institutional investors like pension funds may use dark pools to sell big blocks of stock away from the public scrutiny of an exchange like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq that could drive the share price lower. “Given the growth of dark pools, this lack of transparency could create a two-tiered market that deprives the public of information about stock prices,” the chairwoman of the S.E.C., Mary L. Schapiro, said before the vote at the agency’s meeting. Two Republican commissioners, Kathleen Casey and Troy A. Paredes, while voting to put out the proposed rules for public comment, cautioned against rushing to overly broad regulation that could have a negative impact on market innovation and competition. Dark pools might decide to maintain stock trading at levels below those that activate the required public display under the proposed rules, Mr. Paredes said. “Darker dark pools” could be worse than the current situation, he suggested. When investors place an order to buy or sell a stock on an exchange, the order is normally displayed for the public to view. With some dark pools, investors can signal their interest in buying or selling a stock, but that indication of interest is communicated only to a group of market participants. That means investors who operate within the dark pool have access to information about potential trades that other investors, using public quotes, do not, the S.E.C. says. The proposal would require indications of interest to be treated like other stock quotes and subject to the same disclosure rules. A 1999 S.E.C. rule established a separate set of regulations for alternative trading systems, which have grown to 29, from 10 in 2002. Among the pools are Credit Suisse Group’s CrossFinder, Knight Link, Goldman Sachs Group’s Sigma X, Getco and LeveL, according to the TABB Group, an analytical firm based in Westborough, Mass.",

    "source": "International Energy Agency Sees Oil Use Falling <eos> Global oil consumption will drop this year for the first time since 1983, as an economic downturn in the West and slower growth in China cut fuel demand, according to the world’s main energy forecaster. The International Energy Agency, an adviser to industrialized nations, said on Thursday that it projects worldwide demand to fall by 200,000 barrels a day, to 85.8 million barrels a day, in 2008. The new forecast is 350,000 barrels a day less than the agency’s last monthly report, which is widely read among energy experts. Oil demand may recover somewhat next year, although at a much slower pace, as the global economy turns the corner in the second half of 2009, according to the energy agency. It sees consumption growing by 0.5 percent, or 400,000 barrels a day. That is still 260,000 barrels a day less than was expected last month. “Clearly, if we are now heading for a prolonged and global outright recession, then the 0.5 percent global oil demand growth we now envisage for next year may not materialize,” according to the report. Many other energy forecasts have painted a far bleaker picture of the oil markets for the next 12 months. Many analysts had already predicted lower consumption this year, and some also expect demand to drop next year. The Energy Department said earlier this week that global consumption would probably fall by 450,000 barrels a day in 2009, the first time in more than 30 years that demand will decline for two consecutive years. As a result of the global recession, the price of oil has fallen more than 70 percent since its peak this summer as demand dropped in the United States and other industrialized countries. Oil fell to $40 a barrel last week, after rising as high as $147 a barrel in intraday trading in July. On Thursday, oil futures in New York surged $4.46 to $47.98 a barrel, after the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said that his country had cut its production to 8.5 million barrels a day, down more than 1.2 million barrels a day from its August peak. The agency’s report could add grist to the view that producers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries must reduce their output to prevent a complete price collapse. The oil cartel is meeting next week in Algeria to consider reducing its output and stem the price drop. The world’s idle production capacity has risen to its highest level in six years, and now stands at nearly five million barrels a day. Tight spare capacity, which had fallen to a low of a million barrels a day, was a big factor in the price surge in recent years. OPEC’s efforts to stabilize prices may be getting some assistance from other producers. Russia suggested on Wednesday that it would coordinate a possible production cut with the cartel, while President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia said on Thursday that the country could not rule out joining OPEC, according to local news agencies. Other producers that have cooperated with OPEC in the past, like Norway or Mexico, have so far ruled out cutting production. Oil demand in the United States has been particularly hard-hit this year, especially when gasoline prices exceeded $4 a gallon nationwide over the summer. Consumption is expected to fall by 6.3 percent this year compared with 2007, to 19.4 million barrels a day, and again by 1.4 percent in 2009, the energy agency said. But as gasoline prices have fallen back to a nationwide average of $1.66 a gallon, there are preliminary signs that consumption may be picking up again. Last week, gasoline demand rose for the first time in 33 weeks, according to a survey of national sales conducted by MasterCard.",

    "source": "U.S.C. Erases Stanford From the National Title Picture <eos> LOS ANGELES — As it turns out, a loss to Utah, once the lone blemish on Stanford’s sterling résumé, will have little effect on sorting out the Bowl Championship Series title contenders over the final weeks of the regular season. Nine days after thrusting themselves back into the national championship chase with a dominating victory over Oregon on national television, the fourth-ranked Cardinal fell with a thud Saturday night, when Andre Heidari’s 47-yard field goal with 19 seconds lifted Southern California to 20-17 victory in a Pacific-12 Conference matchup. Stanford looked sluggish at the start, and even after reasserting control, the Cardinal squandered several scoring opportunities in the fourth quarter. Quarterback Kevin Hogan, who had not been needed to throw against Oregon, threw two costly interceptions in the fourth quarter. One killed a drive inside U.S.C.’s 10-yard line. The other, a regrettable throw while Hogan was in the grasp of linebacker Hayes Pullard, set up the Trojans’ winning drive. “It was Kevin trying to do too much,” Stanford Coach David Shaw said. “He was trying to get rid of the ball, but he threw the ball in bounds. He should have just taken a sack and played it smart.” That failed gambit led to a successful one — by the Trojans interim coach Ed Orgeron, who kept his offense on the field facing fourth-and-2 at the Stanford 48 with 1 minute 23 seconds to play. “I knew I was taking a chance,” Orgeron said, adding that he knew by looking at his players that they wanted to go for it. “I wanted to take the best shot to give them what they wanted.” From there, it was left to two Trojans who had been having disappointing seasons to rescue their teammates. Marqise Lee, the Biletnikoff Award winner a year ago, has been bothered by knee and hamstring injuries as well as increased defensive attention. After catching one pass in a rout of California last week, Lee joked that he would file for unemployment benefits. But Lee, who had hobbled off the field moments earlier with an injured shin, told quarterback Cody Kessler he had one more play in him. Kessler hit him on a slant for 13 yards. That set up the field goal by Heidari, who had missed two attempts in a 10-7 loss to Washington State and two more in a 14-10 loss to Notre Dame. He also had missed an extra-point attempt earlier Saturday. But before his kick had even sailed through the uprights in the final seconds, Heidari’ had sprinted to the opposite end zone in celebration as the sold-out Coliseum shook. Moments later, students and fans poured onto the field, as the Trojans continued their resurgence since the firing of Lane Kiffin as coach last month. The Trojans have begun to resemble a different team since Kiffin was summoned off the team bus in the middle of the night and fired as they returned from a blowout loss at Arizona State. Their only blemish in six games under Orgeron was the defeat at Notre Dame. The Trojans (8-3, 5-2 in the Pac-12 South) kept their Rose Bowl hopes alive. The victory also gave considerable momentum to Orgeron’s candidacy to stay on as coach beyond this season. Last week, Athletic Director Pat Haden said Orgeron would be considered. The loss not only ended Stanford’s national title hopes but also severely dented its Rose Bowl hopes. The Cardinal (8-2, 6-2) now trail Oregon by a game in the North Division, although they hold the tiebreaker. “It’s not a good feeling,” Stanford running back Tyler Gaffney said. “It’s the first time I’ve lost to them and I think it’s the first time anyone on this team has lost to them. It’s a tough thing to swallow.” Stanford did not waste time giving life to the idea that it would be ripe for a letdown. Although the Cardinal had won five of its last six games against U.S.C., the last three were by a total of 17 points, and they had played so brilliantly against Oregon. Before the game was three plays old, the Cardinal was whistled for a false start and had to use two timeouts. When they finally ran a play, Ty Montgomery, who had raced past the U.S.C. defense, watched a long pass slip through his hands. The Cardinal fell into a 17-7 hole but began to assert themselves late in the first half. When they drew even on Gaffney’s 18-yard run with 8:22 left in the third quarter, their physical offensive line had begun to wear on a U.S.C. defense that because of injuries had used only two substitutes. For an offense seemingly built for tight spaces, the Cardinal struggled in the red zone — which had to bring back unpleasant memories of its only defeat, a 27-21 loss to Utah that ended when Stanford was stopped on down in the final seconds inside the Utah 10-yard line. On Saturday night, the Cardinal managed only 17 points on five trips inside the red zone. Conrad Ukropina’s 30-yard field goal, which would have put Stanford ahead, was blocked midway through the third, and Hogan was intercepted by Dion Bailey at the Trojans’ 7-yard line with just under 11 minutes left. But that mistake was not as costly as his final one, which the freshman Su’a Cravens picked off at the Trojans’ 44. It almost certainly ended Stanford’s hopes for a trip to the national title game.",

    "source": "Maruyama Has Two-Shot Lead at Sony Open <eos> HONOLULU (AP) — Shigeki Maruyama had another five-under-par 65 and found himself atop the leader board in the Sony Open on Saturday, allowing him to look ahead to the final round. He is more concerned about stamina than nerves. Maruyama, winless on the PGA Tour since 2003, hit a bunker shot that banged into the pin and dropped for birdie on the par-3 seventh to break out of a tie, and a two-putt birdie on the short par-5 ninth gave him a two-shot advantage over the early starters. Stuart Appleby, the 18-hole leader, was among those who played Waialae in the afternoon. Because the opening round was washed out by rain, the Sony Open is to be decided by a 36-hole final round Sunday. Maruyama, 41, looked at his shoes and said with a laugh: “My feet. It’s a problem.” Maruyama, who was at 10-under 130, added, “I’m getting older, and 36 holes is going to be a struggle.” He was two shots clear of Steve Marino (67) and Roland Thatcher (65), whose runner-up finish at Disney in the final PGA Tour event last year enabled him to keep his card and book a trip to Hawaii. Matt Kuchar, coming off a PGA Tour money title and the Vardon Trophy, had a 67 and was at 133. The group at 134 includes Boo Weekley (66) and Chris DiMarco (67), who are looking to turn their fortunes around. Anthony Kim had the best score of the morning group, a 64 that put him back in the picture. Maruyama, playing on a sponsor exemption, is popular at this tournament with several Japanese in the gallery and a Japanese sponsor. He has not been heard from much since going three straight seasons with a PGA Tour victory a decade ago. But he is well aware the tournament is only half over. “I haven’t gotten that far yet to think about winning,” he said through an interpreter. “Right now, it’s just been about really trying to play good golf and entertain the Japanese tourists.”",

    "source": "Matt Cain Pitches the Giants Past the Phillies <eos> SAN FRANCISCO — Just about every time he had faced the Philadelphia Phillies , Matt Cain had been treated like a piñata. So when Cain, a soft-spoken right-hander, took the mound Tuesday afternoon, he made it clear with a couple of well-placed fastballs — one under the chin of Cole Hamels and the other in the ribs of Shane Victorino — that he would not be batted around this time. Cain was dominant, allowing two hits over seven innings, and the Cody Ross-fueled offense continued to be just enough as the Giants beat the Phillies, 3-0 , to take a 2-1 lead in the National League Championship Series. “No question, there’s a sense of confidence when you’re going against such a great team and outstanding pitching,” said Giants Manager Bruce Bochy, who will send Madison Bumgarner against Joe Blanton on Wednesday in Game 4. “You find a way to win ballgames, it does a lot for them.” This was nothing like the Cain the Phillies had seen before. He had never beaten them, and he had a 6.23 earned run average in five career starts . But Cain struck out five, walked three and hit two, and he capped his day by retiring Victorino with two runners on to end the seventh inning. Javier Lopez and Brian Wilson pitched the final two innings. “From what I’ve seen of him in the past, he would get kind of aggressive with his fastball,” Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel said. “Today, he used all his pitches and his command was better. He pitched a super game.” It was a near-perfect day in San Francisco, and it was that way from start to finish for the Giants. Barry Bonds made a rare appearance at AT&T Park, bouncing up the dugout steps to throw a ceremonial first pitch, and waving his arms to a loud ovation. Bonds might have a place in this lineup, as much as it struggles to score, but with the pitching the Giants continue to receive, it was again enough. San Francisco won its fourth playoff game in which it has scored three runs or fewer. And again, Ross was at the center of it, his run-scoring single with two outs sparking a two-run fourth inning. “For the most part, it’s about confidence, going up there and knowing you’re going to get the job done or do something to help your team,” said Ross, who has hit three home runs in the series. If the Giants’ confidence soared after they took a 2-0 lead, it is not without reason. The Giants were 63-19 in the regular season and are 4-1 in the playoffs when they score first. “It’s important for us to get runs early to take the pressure off them,” Giants second baseman Freddy Sanchez said. “I think it’s difficult for any pitching staff when it’s 0-0, or 1-0.” Though Tim Lincecum has turned in the Giants’ signature pitching performance of the playoffs — a 2-hit, 14-strikeout shutout of Atlanta — and Jonathan Sanchez has won key games down the stretch, Cain has been quietly effective in the playoffs. In 13 2/3 innings, he has not allowed an earned run. “This has got to be the top one, really,” Cain said. “To be able to pitch in the postseason is great, and to be able to go out there and throw the ball well and help your team win is a great feeling.” The Phillies put the ball in play against Cain, but rarely did they do so with any authority. He allowed only singles by Carlos Ruiz and Ryan Howard. “What he does best is he’s able to throw all his pitches for strikes and he keeps those guys off balance, and when you have a team with as much firepower as Philadelphia has, you have to do that,” said center fielder Aaron Rowand, a former Phillie. “If you’re not throwing strikes with certain pitches, they’re going to recognize that and then they’re going to sit on the other ones and make you pay.” The hardest-hit ball may have been Raul Ibanez’s line drive at first baseman Aubrey Huff in the seventh. Cain then hit Ruiz and walked pinch-hitter Ross Gload, but after a visit from Bochy, he retired Victorino on a groundout to second. For Chase Utley, the Phillies’ star second baseman, it was not a good day in the field. He has had problems throwing the ball in recent playoffs, and he did little to help with his glove Tuesday. Huff’s two-out roller into the hole escaped under his glove, bringing in the second run in the fourth. And the Giants added another in the fifth when Utley misread Sanchez’s soft liner. Instead of taking two steps in to catch it, Utley played the ball on a short hop, and it caromed off his chest and into center field. The play, ruled a hit, allowed Rowand to score from second. At the center of each Giants rally were Rowand and Edgar Renteria, a couple of playoff-tested veterans who lost their starting jobs in the second half. They were put into the lineup because the Giants had struggled to score any runs that were not produced by Ross. Center fielder Andres Torres and third baseman Mike Fontenot, who were a combined 5 for 37 in the postseason, were benched, and Juan Uribe, who has a sore wrist, was shifted to third to create a spot for Renteria at shortstop. The Phillies are searching for a similar spark. “There’s not enough time to analyze situations,” Victorino said. “Let’s go out there and worry about tomorrow.” Nearby, Howard, with a host of reporters waiting at his locker to speak with him, excused himself to spit out some mouthwash. Washing away the taste of this defeat, though, had to wait another day.",

    "source": "Police Shooting Victim in Georgia Tried to Follow ‘Sensible’ Path <eos> MONCKS CORNER, S.C. — Long before two bullets from a police officer’s handgun tore through Anthony Hill’s chest, he had tattooed it with the words of advice that his grandfather regularly imparted to him in this small Southern city: “Be sensible.” Last week, Mr. Hill’s relatives buried him in Moncks Corner. On their shirts and lapels, they had pinned photos of him, smiling and sharp, in his Air Force uniform. It was a wordless rebuke to the TV news images that had shown Mr. Hill as he wandered in his last moments — naked, unarmed and acting in a way that alarmed neighbors — through his suburban Atlanta apartment complex. It was March 9, a Monday afternoon. A DeKalb County police officer, Robert Olsen, arrived on the scene, responding to a 911 call. Witnesses said that Mr. Hill, an African-American, approached the officer, who is white, with his hands either up or at his sides, but that he did not heed the policeman’s order to stop. Officer Olsen fired. And Mr. Hill would become another hashtag for a roiling movement of Americans who questioned the value that police officers place on black lives. For those closest to Mr. Hill, the pain has been amplified by the fact that he had, until that last day, largely heeded his grandfather’s counsel. He had no criminal record. He had served in the war in Afghanistan. And before his death, Mr. Hill, 26, had been trying, like many other Americans, to make sense of the complex questions of race and law enforcement that have emerged since the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Image Anthony Hill with his parents. In a Twitter post on Dec. 24, Mr. Hill challenged protesters not to reflexively condemn all police officers. “If 99 of 100 officers” were on the streets “killing black men like its hunting season,” he wrote , “that still leaves 1 just doing his job. Stop w/ the generalizations.” A state investigation of the shooting is underway. But according to friends and family, doctors told Mr. Hill that he had bipolar disorder after he returned from Afghanistan. They believe that his bizarre antics before the shooting — in which he removed his clothes and clambered down from a second-floor balcony — were symptoms of his illness. In Moncks Corner, the grief and anger commingled with incredulity. Mr. Hill was the last man anyone would have expected to tangle with the police, they said. And he deserved better. “To come home from Afghanistan and be killed by someone who’s supposed to protect you — that I don’t understand,” said James A. Hill, 29, Mr. Hill’s brother. His father, also named Anthony, said, “Why would you go directly to deadly force for someone who clearly does not have a weapon?” Image Anthony Hill’s mother, Carolyn Giummo, and his grandmother Theola Baylor, who helped raise him, in Moncks Corner, S.C. Credit Stephen Morton for The New York Times Mr. Hill’s mother, Carolyn Giummo, said that she did not hate Officer Olsen, who has been placed on administrative leave pending the inquiry by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. “I’m very disappointed in him,” she said. Ms. Giummo, 54, raised her son with the help of her parents, Theola and William Baylor, in Moncks Corner, a Lowcountry city of 7,900 where residents take pride in a certain racial harmony. The public high school, from which Mr. Hill graduated in 2006, is racially mixed, and students tend to segregate by areas of interest, not skin color. Over the years, Mr. Hill’s extended family came to include a number of nonblack members. “I never thought to tell my son, ‘You’re black, you’d better look out,’ ” said Ms. Giummo, who is African-American. Armed instead with “Be sensible” — his grandfather’s counsel nearly every time he left the house — Mr. Hill came of age in a world that revolved around school, family and the weekly rhythms set by the Moncks Corner African Methodist Episcopal Church, where he sang in the youth choir and was captivated, early on, by the power of music. In high school, he played the male lead, Danny Zuko, in a production of “Grease.” The summer after graduation, his mother said, he worked as an intern with a local law enforcement agency. He tried his hand at college, but eventually dropped out to enlist, in 2008, in the Air Force. Two years later, Mr. Hill was deployed to Afghanistan. His father said he had been responsible for loading ordnance into aircraft in Kandahar Province. Image Pallbearers carried the flag-draped coffin of Anthony Hill for his funeral service at the Berkeley High School auditorium in Moncks Corner, S.C. Credit Stephen Morton for The New York Times His Atlanta roommate, Kailien Alexander, a 23-year-old college student, said that Mr. Hill had told him that he had post-traumatic stress disorder, and that he had seen children killed in Afghanistan. “It just didn’t sit right with him,” Mr. Alexander said. After doctors diagnosed the disorder, his mother said, he was “medically retired” from the Air Force. Later, Mr. Hill moved to Atlanta, in hopes of breaking into the music business. He worked as an intern at a recording studio, and took odd jobs while constructing R&B tracks at home, sometimes recording in his closet with Mr. Alexander’s help. He was open about his mental illness, even commenting about it on Twitter. The illness, his family members said, seemed to mostly manifest itself in bursts of hourslong phone conversations. But before March 9, no one had seen him fully lose control. Mr. Alexander said he and Mr. Hill were poor but happy, and eager to make friends in an apartment complex mostly filled by families. One hot afternoon, Mr. Alexander recalled, the pair spent some of their last money on ice pops for the children in the neighborhood. They also followed the national conversation about minorities and the police prompted by the shooting in Ferguson. Mr. Alexander said Mr. Hill was troubled by examples of overaggressive policing. But on social media, he challenged those who would dismiss all police officers as evil, and those who sought simple definitions of heroes and villains. “Some of us black folks have to start actually living like #blacklivesmatter but I’ll probably get called a house slave for saying so,” he wrote on March 6. Image Mr. Hill was raised with the help of his grandmother Theola W. Baylor, who wore a pin that showed him in his Air Force uniform. Credit Stephen Morton for The New York Times At the same time, Mr. Hill was struggling with the medication he had been given by doctors at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Bridget Anderson, 22, Mr. Hill’s girlfriend, said he had stopped taking his medicine about 10 days before he was shot. On the morning of March 9, Mr. Hill made his final Facebook post : “Where i once saw death i only see life.” Mr. Alexander said that before he left for class that morning, Mr. Hill seemed upbeat. DeKalb police officials said Officer Olsen had a Taser with him at the time of the shooting. They also said the officer had undergone training in dealing with the mentally ill. This week, the department announced that it would increase its training requirements for “critical incidents,” which include encounters with the mentally ill, but Capt. Steven R. Fore said the change was unrelated to the shooting. In an interview last week, Mr. Hill’s family blamed the Department of Veterans Affairs for failing to properly treat Mr. Hill, arguing that he should have had better guidance after he learned of his mental illness and retired. Officials said they could not comment on an individual case. Ms. Giummo said she did not think her son’s story had much to do with race. “There is a ‘black and white’ issue” in the country, she said, “but our main concern is we want to know what happened.” “And if he was a black officer, we’d still feel the same way,” she added. At Mr. Hill’s funeral last week in the public high school, the P.A. system played Sam Cooke’s “A Change Is Gonna Come” — Mr. Hill’s favorite song. Sandy W. Drayton, the former pastor at Moncks Corner A.M.E. Church, referred to the officer as “the betrayer who misunderstood,” and asked God to forgive him. Mr. Drayton described death as the door that leads away from this world — away from “the racial stuff” and “the ethnocentrism” — and into “a new heaven, a new earth, a New Jerusalem.”",

    "source": "Corporate Tax Plan Unveiled in European Union <eos> BRUSSELS — A new effort to coordinate corporate tax policy in the European Union introduced on Wednesday has increased tensions between some member states and Ireland, which said it was skeptical about the process. The initiative would develop a common basis for calculating corporate taxes across the bloc and allow companies to opt in to the system. The European Commission , which made the proposal, estimated that the plan could save businesses 700 million euros ($973 million) a year in reduced compliance costs and an additional 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in tax benefits. The commission has been trying for years to coordinate the bloc’s corporate tax policy. Previous efforts have come to nothing because changes in tax policy require the agreement of all 27 European Union member states. But this time the politics have changed and — crucially — this plan could work with a smaller group of countries, because some think that those who adopt the proposal could reap competitive advantages rather than lose out. The new plan is a contentious topic within the union, where some countries regard the right to set their own tax rate as a cornerstone of national sovereignty. While the proposals outlined by the commission cover only the tax base, rather than rates, some nations worry that the proposals could be a stepping stone to further coordination of tax policy. If there is no consensus this time, France and Germany are expected to press for an accord among the 17 members of the euro zone. Ireland, which has already come under pressure over its low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent, struck a noncommittal tone on Wednesday. “We remain skeptical about many aspects,” the Irish Finance Ministry said in a statement. But, it said it would work with member states on the issue. Last week, Ireland failed to secure a reduction in the interest it is paying on its 85 billion euro bailout from the union because it refused to promise to work constructively on tax coordination. In talks among the European Union members, Ireland has always had a powerful ally in Britain. But Britain is not a member of the euro zone, theoretically putting Ireland in a weaker bargaining position. Moreover, if any group of countries goes ahead with the proposals, those that stay outside might, potentially, lose out if large multinational companies moved some of their operations to a nation that took part. A British government spokesman, who asked not to be named, said the plan would be considered on its merits. “We would want to ensure that we are constructively engaged in discussions,” the spokesman said. “However, we will not agree to a proposal that might threaten or limit our ability to shape our own tax policy.” “Obstacles to cross-border activity in the field of corporate taxation hamper business development and the growth potential of the single market,” said Philippe de Buck, director general of Businesseurope, a lobbying group. “The proposal to develop a common consolidated corporate tax base could help and is welcome under the condition that it remains a competitive option for companies and excludes any form of tax rate harmonization.”",

    "source": "Tiger Woods Is Missing, but So Is Dominance in Golf <eos> AUGUSTA, Ga. — Four of the six amateurs in the Masters field this week were born after Tiger Woods made his Augusta National debut in 1995. They grew up in a world in which Woods’s contending in a major was a given, like spring following winter. In 75 combined appearances in the four majors, not counting an injury withdrawal during the first round of the 1995 United States Open , Woods missed the cut eight times while recording 37 top-10 finishes. He has 14 major championships. Rory McIlroy, the world No. 2, who can become the first player since Woods to complete a career Grand Slam with a victory this week, has missed the cut four times in 28 major starts while posting 12 top-10s. He has four major titles. Woods, who is missing the Masters for only the second time in 22 years as he recovers from his most recent back surgeries, spent 683 weeks as the world No. 1, including 281 consecutive weeks from June 2005 to October 2010. Led by McIlroy, the 10 players in this year’s field who have ascended to No. 1 have spent a combined 262 weeks at the top. “It is much different than the years Tiger dominated,” McIlroy said, adding, “I don’t know if we’re going to see a 10-year stretch of golf like that in our lifetime. What he did in that time span was amazing.” Adam Scott, who spent 11 weeks at No. 1, also marveled at Woods’s sustained excellence. “What’s hard to imagine is the confidence he must have had going to the golf course to play over that period of time,” said Scott, who won back-to-back starts in late February and early March. “I thought I felt pretty confident rolling around Florida there a couple of weeks ago, but that’s how he felt for 10 years.” Scott, the 2013 Masters champion, added: “It was so good the way he played for such a long period of time. Just getting it done; the more you win, the more you believe in yourself, the more you go for a shot, the more you pull off a shot when it counts. That’s what it was like watching him for that period.” Woods, whose last competitive start was in August, attended the champions dinner Tuesday night. According to one of the attendees, he looked fit. “You know, he’s encouraged,” said Billy Payne, the chairman of Augusta National. “I could tell the fire is building back up in his belly, and I suspect Tiger’s going to be back fairly quickly, and I’m looking forward to it.” NO. 13 MAY BE LONGER The iconic 13th hole at Augusta National features more than 1,500 azaleas, and it could soon gain several yards in length. The club has acquired land from Augusta Country Club bordering Augusta National’s 12th green and 13th tee, affording it the option of adding roughly 50 yards to the hole, a 510-yard par-5 dogleg-left. A new tee was added in 2002 as part of the club’s so-called Tiger-proofing of the course. Led by Woods, the longer players were hitting short-iron second shots. During the 2014 tournament, the long-hitting Bubba Watson found the green with his second shot using a wedge. “Thirteen is one of the holes we’re studying,” Payne said. “We have made no decision whatsoever.” Jack Nicklaus, a six-time Masters champion, said he thought the hole could benefit from some lengthening. “I don’t think there’s any question about that,” he said. “Guys now take it over the top of the trees. I used to be able to do that, too, but the trees were about half the size.” He added: “I think with the way the guys hit the ball today, it’s a little easier than it needs to be. It’s not really a par 5 the way it is.” WATSON’S SWAN SONG Tom Watson, 66, is bowing out of the Masters after this year. In his competitive swan song at Augusta National, he will be paired Thursday with Charley Hoffman and Lee Westwood, whose 18 combined Masters appearances are 24 fewer than those by Watson, who is making his 43rd start. “When you see these kids play out here and see them carry the ball 280 and 290 yards off the tee, it’s time to say I can’t compete with them,” Watson, a two-time champion, said. Watson, who last made the 36-hole cut in 2010, added, “I didn’t want to take up another spot and shoot scores and just not even sniff making the cut.” PALMER TO JOIN CEREMONIAL STARTERS Arnold Palmer, 86, will accompany the other ceremonial starters, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player, to the first tee Thursday, though he is not expected to hit a shot. Palmer, who is in frail health, had a diminished presence last month at the PGA Tour event that he hosts in Orlando, Fla. “He’s a hero,” Billy Payne said. “He’s my hero who needs no club in his hands to receive the recognition and the love that he so richly deserves.”",

Defensive end Pierre-Paul has just one and a half sacks this season, but he has been fearsome against the run and has disrupted many passing plays by forcing the quarterback out of the pocket. Pierre-Paul could be the key to taking the Cowboys’ offense out of its rhythm. But if Smith wins most of the battles with Pierre-Paul, the Giants’ defense is in trouble. Even Perry Fewell, the Giants’ defensive coordinator, was excited about watching the matchup. “Smith is the linchpin of their offense,” he said. “And we’ve got our best guy on him. I think it will be a heavyweight battle.” Number to watch: 6 100-yard rushing games by DeMarco Murray for the Cowboys this season. Murray leads the N.F.L. in rushing.

    "source": "New Communist Party Chief in China Denounces Corruption in Speech <eos> BEIJING — In his first speech to the Chinese Communist Party’s elite Politburo, Xi Jinping , the new party chief, denounced the prevalence of corruption and said officials needed to guard against its spread or it would “doom the party and the state.” The blunt remarks by Mr. Xi were made Saturday at a meeting of the 25-person Politburo, which announced a turnover of 15 members last week during the change in leadership at the close of the 18th Party Congress, the state news media reported on Monday. Mr. Xi’s admonitions suggested that he wanted to take a populist tack in shaping his image, but they were also consistent with warnings that Chinese leaders have delivered in recent years and echoed points he made in his inaugural speech on Thursday. Corruption is one of the issues of greatest concern to Chinese, and Mr. Xi even obliquely referred to the problem in Arab countries and the revolutions there. “In recent years, the long pent-up problems in some countries have led to the venting of public outrage, to social turmoil and to the fall of governments, and corruption and graft have been an important reason,” Mr. Xi said, according to a version of the speech posted online. “A mass of facts tells us that if corruption becomes increasingly serious, it will inevitably doom the party and the state. We must be vigilant. In recent years, there have been cases of grave violations of disciplinary rules and laws within the party that have been extremely malign in nature and utterly destructive politically, shocking people to the core.” Mr. Xi used a Chinese aphorism — “worms come only after matter decays” — to stress his point. The phrase is often attributed to Su Shi, a scholar of the Northern Song dynasty, and it was cited on several recent occasions by Bo Xilai, the disgraced former party chief of Chongqing, who was felled last spring by a murder scandal and is expected to stand trial soon on criminal charges related to abuse of power. When Mr. Bo used the phrase in speeches, it was also in the context of denouncing corruption and enhancing his populist image. Ironically, Mr. Xi’s allusion to recent “grave violations” of party discipline appeared to refer in part to Mr. Bo. Both Mr. Xi and Mr. Bo are sons of powerful Communist leaders, and Mr. Bo, a former Politburo member, was seen as a rival to Mr. Xi. Mr. Xi also took the occasion on Saturday to underscore the need to remain true to the party’s founding ideology, and warned that some officials appeared to be heading down a wayward path in this area, too. “Faith in Marxism and a belief in socialism and communism is the political soul of a Communist and the spiritual pillar that allows a Communist to withstand any test,” Mr. Xi said. “To put it more vividly, ideals and convictions are the spiritual calcium of Communists, and if these ideals and convictions are missing or irresolute, then there is a lack of spiritual calcium that leads to soft bones.” A series of scandals and revelations this year have undermined confidence in China ’s leaders and cast greater scrutiny on the prevalence of nepotism and patronage at the top ranks of the party. All that comes at a time when influential voices are rising inside China calling for fundamental changes to the political and economic systems. The Bo Xilai scandal attracted widespread attention last spring inside China and abroad. Then Bloomberg News reported that the relatives of Mr. Xi held investments and assets worth at least hundreds of millions of dollars, and The New York Times published the results of a yearlong investigation that found the family of Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, held investments and assets worth at least $2.7 billion. The Web sites of both news organizations were blocked in China around the time the articles were published. Pu Zhiqiang, a rights lawyer, said in an interview on Monday that “every generation of leaders has mentioned” corruption upon taking office. “No one would neglect paying attention to the problem of corruption,” he added. “It’s common sense. The crux of the matter is how to implement anti-corruption measures.” On Thursday, the party announced that the new head of its anti-corruption agency, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, would be Wang Qishan, a former vice premier with deep experience in the finance sector. Mr. Wang is now the sixth-ranking party official and is on the seven-man Standing Committee of the Politburo. (In other important appointments, the party announced Monday that Meng Jianzhu, a Politburo member, will take charge of the party’s Central Politics and Law Commission, which oversees security and the courts and was previously run by a Standing Committee member, the much-disliked Zhou Yongkang; and Zhao Leji, also on the Politburo, will be the head of the Organization Department, which oversees personnel issues.) There are those who say that relying on the anti-corruption commission and a nontransparent process to ferret out and punish offending officials is not the right way to set the party straight. At a seminar in Beijing on Friday that was attended by liberal scholars and intellectuals, Chen Youxi, a prominent lawyer and former official, emphasized that point. “Our present approach to fighting corruption basically has increasingly relied on turning the legal authorities into party authorities, strengthening the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and using party oversight against corruption,” he said. “But I think this is a dead end. The more powerful the Discipline Inspection Commission has become, the more serious corruption has become, because if you depend on secretively fighting corruption, you only encourage more corruption.”",

    "source": "Moody’s Reduces Its Outlook for Europe’s Credit Rating <eos> Moody’s Investors Service cut the European Union ’s credit outlook to negative on Monday, reflecting the risks to Germany, France, Britain and the Netherlands, the four countries in the group with AAA ratings, which account for about 45 percent of the group’s budget revenue. Moody’s lowered the outlook on the union’s AAA long-term bond rating from stable, according to a statement released late Monday in Frankfurt. It also changed to negative from stable its outlook on the provisional AAA rating for the European Union’s medium-term note program. The change “reflects the negative outlook on the AAA ratings of the member states with large contributions to the E.U. budget,” Moody’s said. “The creditworthiness of these member states is highly correlated, as they are all exposed, albeit to varying degrees, to the euro area debt crisis .” Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told a crowd of beer drinkers in Bavaria on Monday that Germany must show solidarity with Europe, and indicated that she would back a more active role for the European Central Bank to fight the debt crisis. Her nation shoulders the largest cost of bailing out weaker governments. Risks of a downgrade to the European Union’s sovereign debt rating come from a “deterioration in the creditworthiness of E.U. member states,” Moody’s said. “Additionally, a weakening of the commitment of the member states to the E.U. and changes to the E.U.’s fiscal framework that led to less conservative budget management would be credit negative.” Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, told officials on Monday that he would be comfortable buying three-year government bonds to bring down borrowing costs for nations in financial distress. European leaders are stepping up shuttle diplomacy this week as they brace for Mr. Draghi’s plan to defend the euro from bond market turmoil. Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Union, is traveling to Berlin for talks with Ms. Merkel on Tuesday as Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy welcomes President François Hollande of Italy to Rome. The yield on Italian 10-year bonds declined 8 basis points yesterday to 5.77 percent. That was still 439 basis points more than the yield on similar maturity German bunds. Spain’s 10-year bonds were yielding 6.85 percent, near the 7 percent level that compelled Greece, Portugal and Ireland to seek bailouts. “The outlook for the E.U.’s ratings could return to stable if the outlooks on the ratings of the key AAA countries with contributions to the E.U. budget also returned to stable,” Moody’s said of the 27-member group.",

    "source": "In Bosnia, Doubts About Vote, and About Future <eos> PRAGUE — The potential for achieving unity in Bosnia appeared in doubt on Monday after preliminary election results showed deep divisions in the ethnically divided country and election officials said they would investigate accusations of voting fraud. Suad Arnautovic, an election commission member, said the commission would begin an inquiry after 10 percent of the ballots in the race for the Serb presidency, one element of the country’s three-member presidency, were voided. The election was being closely watched as a test case of whether Bosnia can overcome deadlock and undertake changes needed to advance the country’s goals of becoming a member of the European Union and NATO. Under a 1995 accord brokered by the United States, what was once a single entity, Bosnia and Herzegovina, was split into a Muslim-Croat Federation and a Serbian Republic. But the decentralized institutional structure that emerged, coupled with strong residual nationalism among the country’s disparate ethnic groups, has made it extremely difficult for Bosnia to move forward. The preliminary election results underlined the risks, with Muslims and Croats favoring leaders advocating national unity and Bosnian Serbs choosing candidates who called for the country’s breakup. Bakir Izetbegovic, the son of Bosnia’s wartime Muslim leader and a proponent of dialogue among the ethnic groups, appeared poised to win the race for the Muslim presidency, ousting the incumbent Haris Silajdzic, whose vociferous opposition to the Serbian Republic has contributed to national deadlock. The current Croat member of the presidency, Zeljko Komsic, a moderate who comes from a multiethnic party, also won another four-year term. However, analysts said that Bosnia’s already fragile cohesion remained under serious threat because of the strong showing of Milorad Dodik, the Bosnian Serb leader, who was elected president of the Serbian Republic and has repeatedly threatened secession. The leading contender to be the Serb representative on the country’s presidency, Nebojsa Radmanovic, also wants Bosnian Serbs to seek independence. Srecko Latal, a Balkan analyst with the International Crisis Group in Sarajevo, said that the moderate inclination of Bosnian Muslims would either isolate Mr. Dodik or magnify his intransigence. If Bosnia’s Muslims “extend a hand to Dodik and he rejects them, then that will pull him out into the open,” he said. He added, “Dodik will have no excuse for his attempts to rip the country apart.”",

    "source": "Sublime Serves Up Big Flavors and Portions - Review <eos> WHEN Scott Howlett, a veteran chef for hire, finally opened his own first restaurant in June 2009, he didn’t want to feel locked in to a particular kind of cuisine. So the name he chose — Sublime — deliberately offered few culinary clues, though it did set expectations high. Mr. Howlett’s menu is dotted with the influences of a career spent cooking Japanese, pan-Asian and, to a lesser extent, Latin American and Mediterranean dishes. But that isn’t anything to apologize for. Asian accents, in particular, pop up all over the menu at Sublime, a bustling place sleekly done up in blues and browns — with the odd pair of longhorns nodding to Mr. Howlett’s favorite college football team — in a nondescript building near the Gladstone train station. Mr. Howlett’s own accent is that of Bayonne, and it’s slightly unexpected in horse country; indeed, he confesses to missing being “closer to civilization.” But it’s Somerset County’s good fortune that this 6-foot-2-inch, 250-pound former linebacker chose to serve up his he-man-size portions here. Take his scallops: Mr. Howlett starts with five big diver scallops weighing at least 1.6 ounces apiece, pan-sears them in butter, cooks them through in the oven, then finishes them in the pan with fresh butter to make a glaze worth savoring. He embeds them in a mountain of creamy, buttery mashed potatoes, laced with chives and truffle oil, accompanied by creamed fresh corn with saffron, onions and garlic. The filet is just as generous (if pricey at $38) and just as dangerous: nine ounces of Black Angus, grilled after being wrapped in applewood-smoked bacon, and served with mashed potatoes — this time spiced with chipotle peppers — sweet hush puppies and a syrupy maple-and-cider vinegar gastrique. Mr. Howlett delicately balances flavors and takes pains to ensure that his food looks as fresh as it tastes. So the beef tartare is made to order and chopped by hand, not ground. (Grinding, he says, partially cooks the fatty meat, changing its bright red color and turning it to paste.) He mixes in a house-made garlic-ginger-sake ketchup, fresh chives and a hint of Szechuan pepper; sits it atop a toasted brioche; tops the beef with a raw quail egg; and dresses the plate with a mayonnaise made with Thai sweet chili. The mussels, which one of my companions said were the best she had ever tasted, have their roots in a nine-week trip Mr. Howlett made to Japan, where he learned to make a sauce of red Thai curry paste, garlic and ginger, onions, sake, apples and bananas for sweetness, and seasonings including thyme and kaffir lime leaves. Dishes like that make Sublime’s appetizers its strong suit. The baked brie, for another, is uplifted by basil-infused orange-blossom honey and the chopped macadamia nuts baked along with it. The crab and avocado salad grabs one’s attention with its heavily applied tangy dressing of garlic, shallot, thyme, honey and lemon. Yet, while the first courses made good on the promise of the restaurant’s name, entrees did not always deliver the way the scallops and the filet did. The braised short ribs struck me as bland, and they were dry on my first visit (though tender on the second). The mahi mahi and couscous of dashi kombu — Japanese dried fish-and-kelp stock — seemed better on the page than on the plate. But the tuna katsu — breaded, twice fried and surrounded by a flavorful potato hash and that Thai curry sauce — worked nicely. Desserts were plentiful — unnecessarily so, given what had preceded them — but mostly unmemorable. The plate of six house-made truffles stood out, with flavor combinations of exotic teas and fruits. At his best, Mr. Howlett offers zesty, high-spirited cooking, matched by generous portions, in a lively but intimate setting. Sublime? Maybe not. Satisfying? Without a doubt. • Sublime 12 Lackawanna Avenue Gladstone (908) 781-1888 sublimenj.com WORTH IT THE SPACE Seating for 88 in two sleek dining rooms, and 14 seats at the bar; patio for 20 in good weather.

    "source": "Former Workers’ Compensation Judge Appointed to Lead System <eos> Gov. David A. Paterson has appointed Robert E. Beloten, a longtime workers’ compensation judge, as the chairman of the New York State Workers’ Compensation Board, a spokesman for the governor said on Wednesday. Mr. Beloten, 56, was named one of the board’s 12 commissioners in May, after having been a workers’ compensation judge from 1988 to 1996 and from 2000 until he became a commissioner. As a judge, he worked mostly in the system’s office in Jamaica, Queens. He will succeed Zachary S. Weiss, who has resigned to become a judge in the Social Security system. Mr. Weiss was appointed as the chairman less than two years ago with a mandate to bring sweeping change to a system long criticized for its delays and ineffectiveness. Mr. Beloten, who was a law student with Mr. Paterson at Hofstra University, will lead a $5.5 billion-a-year system that has 1,500 employees and handles about 140,000 new cases each year. Mr. Beloten said he would like to continue the changes begun by Eliot Spitzer when he was governor and furthered by Mr. Paterson and Mr. Weiss. “I think all systems have room for improvement,” Mr. Beloten said in a telephone interview. “I think we’ve made substantial strides.” He said his priority would be to shorten the amount of time it took for claimants to receive benefits. “This is an opportunity where you can really touch people and their lives,” he said. “You can help people rise again after they’ve been injured. You can help increase their self-esteem. You deal with the two most important issues that affect these people: medical care and replacement wages when they’re disabled.” Mr. Beloten will assume the chairmanship on July 15, state officials said. Since Mr. Beloten is already on the compensation board, his appointment does not require Senate confirmation. During the four years between his stints as a compensation judge, Mr. Beloten worked for Keating & Klein, a law firm on Long Island that specializes in health care law. From 1985 to 1988, he was an assistant counsel for the New York State Racing and Wagering Board. He has lectured extensively on workers’ compensation and medical law. Three months ago, The New York Times published a series that detailed the shortcomings of the state’s compensation system. The series found that cases dragged on needlessly for months or years, that doctors’ opinions were frequently skewed and that businesses often retaliated against employees who filed claims. Even though the system was conceived as a no-fault process, it has produced workplaces plagued by mistrust. “It’s an area where you can try to make people as whole as possible, to try to put them in the same position they had before they were injured,” Mr. Beloten said.",

    "source": "Dow-DuPont Deal Seems Impermeable to a Bid by BASF <eos> DuPont’s planned union with Dow Chemical, both American companies, looks like a tough nut for interlopers to crack. The German chemical giant BASF is considering a counterbid for DuPont, its rival, according to Bloomberg . But tax benefits alone make the American conglomerates’ merger and expected breakup pretty close to ironclad. Dow and DuPont agreed in December to a multipart transaction in which they would combine, cut costs and then split into three listed companies. The companies’ nearly equal market values and overlapping shareholders allowed them to structure the deal in a way that should avoid taxes on capital gains — a feat that BASF could struggle to match. The tax savings were not quantified but might far exceed the American companies’ target of $3 billion of annual cost savings, according to Reuters sources. Derailing the merger would probably require BASF to offer a significant premium for DuPont — after covering the $1.9 billion breakup fee and any tax savings the Dow deal would have produced. The German conglomerate could struggle to pull all that off without destroying value for its own shareholders. BASF’s strength in pesticides and other kinds of crop protection would complement DuPont’s valuable seeds business. The companies’ otherwise-limited overlap, however, suggests the synergies from any deal between them would fall short of what a Dow-DuPont transaction could produce, according to Bernstein analysts. The potential synergies of a BASF merger with DuPont would be up to $1.1 billion a year, the analysts estimate, while a Dow-DuPont union would, conservatively, produce $1.7 billion. Tax the BASF deal on a blend of the companies’ tax rates, apply a multiple of 10 and subtract $1.9 billion for the breakup fee, and the German company might struggle to justify paying 11 percent above DuPont’s market value before the Dow deal was announced. If BASF is looking for a transaction that stacks up on the raw numbers, it’s unlikely to get there. The better option could be to wait until after Dow and DuPont merge and then bid for the agricultural chemicals business they plan to spin off. There might be complications, though. The spinoff could lose its tax-free status if the Internal Revenue Service concluded that a deal with BASF was discussed in advance. Closing the transaction at hand, rather than taking that risk, still seems the safest bet.",

    "source": "New Studies of Permian Extinction Shed Light on the ‘Great Dying’ <eos> It may never be as well known as the Cretaceous extinction, the one that killed off the dinosaurs. Yet the much earlier Permian extinction — 252 million years ago — was by far the most catastrophic of the planet’s five known paroxysms of species loss. No wonder it is called the Great Dying: Scientists calculate that about 95 percent of marine species, and an uncountable but probably comparable percentage of land species, went extinct in a geological heartbeat. The cause or causes of the Permian extinction remain a mystery. Among the hypotheses are a devastating asteroid strike, as in the Cretaceous extinction; a catastrophic volcanic eruption; and a welling-up of oxygen-depleted water from the depths of the oceans. Now, painstaking analyses of fossils from the period point to a different way to think about the problem. And at the same time, they are providing startling new clues to the behavior of modern marine life and its future. In two recent papers, scientists from Stanford and the University of California, Santa Cruz, adopted a cellular approach to what they called the “killing mechanism”: not what might have happened to the entire planet, but what happened within the cells of the animals to finish them off. Their study of nearly 50,000 marine invertebrate fossils in 8,900 collections from the Permian period has allowed them to peer into the inner workings of the ancient creatures, giving them the ability to describe precisely how some died while others lived. “Before, scientists were all over the map,” said one of the authors, Matthew E. Clapham, an earth scientist at Santa Cruz. “We thought maybe lots of things were going on.” Dr. Clapham and his co-author, Jonathan L. Payne, a Stanford geochemist, concluded that animals with skeletons or shells made of calcium carbonate, or limestone, were more likely to die than those with skeletons of other substances. And animals that had few ways of protecting their internal chemistry were more apt to disappear. Being widely dispersed across the planet was little protection against extinction, and neither was being numerous. The deaths happened throughout the ocean. Nor was there any correlation between extinction and how a creature moved or what it ate. Instead, the authors concluded, the animals died from a lack of dissolved oxygen in the water, an excess of carbon dioxide, a reduced ability to make shells from calcium carbonate, altered ocean acidity and higher water temperatures. They also concluded that all these stresses happened rapidly and that each one amplified the effects of the others. That led to a wholesale change in the ocean’s dominant animals within just 200,000 years, or perhaps much less, Dr. Clapham said. Among the hardest hit were corals; many types, including the horn-shaped bottom-dwellers known as rugose corals, disappeared altogether. Sea sponges were also devastated, along with the shelled creatures that commanded the Permian reefs and sea. Every single species of the once common trilobites, with their helmetlike front shells, vanished for good. No major group of marine invertebrates or protists, a group of mainly one-celled microorganisms, went unscathed. Instead, gastropods like snails and bivalves like clams and scallops became the dominant creatures after the Permian. And that shift led directly to the assemblage of life in today’s oceans. “Modern marine ecology is shaped by the extinction spasms of the past,” Dr. Clapham said. So what happened 252 million years ago to cause those physiological stresses in marine animals? Additional clues from carbon, calcium and nitrogen isotopes of the period, as well as from organic geochemistry, suggest a “perturbation of the global carbon cycle,” the scientists’ second paper concluded — a huge infusion of carbon into the atmosphere and the ocean. But neither an asteroid strike nor an upwelling of oxygen-deprived deep-ocean water would explain the selective pattern of death. Instead, the scientists suspect that the answer lies in the biggest volcanic event of the past 500 million years — the eruptions that formed the Siberian Traps, the stairlike hilly region in northern Russia. The eruptions sent catastrophic amounts of carbon gas into the atmosphere and, ultimately, the oceans; that led to long-term ocean acidification, ocean warming and vast areas of oxygen-poor ocean water. The surprise to Dr. Clapham was how closely the findings from the Great Dying matched today’s trends in ocean chemistry. High concentrations of carbon-based gases in the atmosphere are leading to warming, rapid acidification and low-oxygen dead zones in the oceans. The idea that changes in ocean chemistry, particularly acidification, could be a factor in a mass extinction is a relatively new idea, said Andrew H. Knoll, a Harvard geologist who wrote a seminal paper in 1996 exploring the consequences of a rapid increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere on the physiology of organisms. “In terms of the overall pattern of change, what we’re seeing now and what is predicted in the next two centuries is riding a parallel track to what we think happened in the past,” he said. Dr. Clapham noted that Permian and modern similarities are not exact. The Permian ocean was easier to acidify than today’s ocean because it had less deep-water calcium carbonate, which offsets the acid. But he said that corals are the most vulnerable creatures in the modern ocean for the same reason they were during the Permian extinction. They have little ability to govern their internal chemistry and they rely on calcium carbonate to build their reefs. Chris Langdon, a University of Miami biologist who is a pioneer in ocean acidification research, said corals are undoubtedly in danger across the globe. “Corals, I think, are going to take it on the chin,” he said. In a recent study , Dr. Langdon examined the effects of naturally high acidification on coral reefs in Papua New Guinea. They showed drastic declines in coral cover at acidity levels likely to be present in the ocean by the end of this century, especially among branching corals that shelter fish. Hans Pörtner, an animal ecophysiologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, said his work showed that a warmer ocean with less dissolved oxygen and greater acidity had an array of negative physiological effects on modern marine animals. The Permian extinction provides an archive of effects suggesting how modern marine creatures will fare as the carbon load in the atmosphere increases, he said. Like Dr. Clapham, he cautioned that the trends between the two periods were not exactly comparable. Back in the Permian, the planet had a single supercontinent, Pangea, and ocean currents were different. And he and Dr. Langdon noted that carbon was being injected into the atmosphere today far faster than during the Permian extinction. As Dr. Knoll put it, “Today, humans turn out to be every bit as good as volcanoes at putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.”",

    "source": "Old Carriages on Display in Renovated Galleries at Long Island Museum <eos> STONY BROOK, N.Y. — A fire seems to be blazing inside a wooden row house. Flames crackle and alarmed voices cry out as visitors enter a newly refurbished gallery on the lower level of the carriage museum, part of the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages in Stony Brook. It is one of two renovated spaces that complete a decade-long refurbishment, in stages, of the entire carriage museum. The galleries, housing vehicles that were mostly elsewhere in the museum or in storage, will be unveiled beginning Thursday. As visitors approach the house, a motion sensor sets off sound and lighting effects and what appear to be rippling flames, which are actually fabric strips blown by a hidden fan behind shattered windows, said Joshua Ruff, curator of the carriage and history collections. They create a dramatic backdrop for a display of three 19th-century firefighting vehicles. Image The Tally-Ho. Credit Kathy Kmonicek for The New York Times “You want to try to have an exciting entry, to kind of wake people up, pull them into the gallery and immerse them into a different world,” Mr. Ruff said. The gallery, which shows off 23 other vehicles in other settings, is called The Streets of New York. The adjacent gallery, called Driving for Sport and Pleasure, holds 20 more vehicles, including sleighs, a stagecoach and a recently acquired 19th-century English carriage named the Tally-Ho that launched a driving craze among wealthy Americans. Before visitors reach the Tally-Ho, in a room formerly used for storage, they pass the fire scene. “This is our showstopper,” said Sam Morse, who designed and installed the exhibitions with his Brooklyn company, Southside Design and Building , which makes museum shows. “We wanted that theatrical punch.” Each sequence of sound, light and movement lasts two minutes, he said, and changes slightly over time so that people lingering in the gallery won’t see and hear the same things over and over. (There are also short breaks.) Image A phaeton. Credit Kathy Kmonicek for The New York Times The firefighting equipment looks quaint by today’s standards: an 1870 hose cart that was used by the Patchogue fire department until 1904 and was pulled by firemen, not horses, as an accompanying photograph shows; an 1807 gooseneck pumper, which could emit a pressurized stream of water and was used in Manhattan and Queens; and a more advanced 1874 steam pumper, which, weighing 9,000 pounds and standing 10 feet tall, proved too big for the narrow streets of New Orleans and was sent back to be used in New Hampshire, where it had been made. Beyond the fire scene, visitors enter a Manhattan streetscape of the late 1800s and early 1900s lined with replicas of old-fashioned lampposts and a variety of original vehicles, from a 1900 Standard Oil delivery wagon to a 1907 popcorn wagon that, according to signs painted on its sides, sold freshly popped corn and roasted peanuts at 5 cents a serving. Popcorn, an explanatory panel notes, was a brand-new snack food when it was introduced at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Behind the stream of wagons, buggies and carts are large blowups, stretching from the floor nearly to the ceiling, of period photographs showing the streets of New York during those turn-of-the-century years. At several audio stations, visitors can punch a button to hear recorded descriptions of the era, like a reminiscence drawn from the memoir of a “cartman,” who made pickups and deliveries. Image An 1870 hose wagon. Credit Kathy Kmonicek for The New York Times That one is near a hand-pulled cart used by a painter to carry his supplies, which is parked in front of a large photograph showing a similar cart piled with produce, and other vendors peddling their wares, on a crowded street in Lower Manhattan. The refurbishing of all eight carriage galleries, Mr. Ruff said, was meant to provide “a new, fresh and innovative stage for people to appreciate the collection, to bring in social history and compelling people stories, and to put the vehicles into a context, a setting, so that people can see them as a link to that era of transportation that served America before the automobile.” One elegant small carriage that appears in the street scene is a coupé made about 1860. As one of the exhibition’s informative panels explains, it was used in the funeral procession for President Abraham Lincoln in New York on April 25, 1865, which was attended by more than 75,000 mourners. Image A 1900 oil wagon. Credit Kathy Kmonicek for The New York Times It stands near what is called a gypsy wagon from around 1870, decorated with landscapes, seascapes and other paintings. A panel says it belonged to Phoebe Stanley, sometimes referred to as Gypsy Queen Phoebe, from West Natick, Mass. Vehicles used for public transportation, including a hansom cab from around 1895 and an omnibus from around 1890, are grouped in the middle of the gallery. In the Driving for Sport and Pleasure gallery, the vehicle in the center of the room is the yellow and black Tally-Ho, America’s first sporting coach, made in London in 1875 and brought to the United States by Col. DeLancey Astor Kane. It sparked a new pastime, popular among the wealthy, called road coaching. Image A gypsy wagon. Credit Kathy Kmonicek for The New York Times Across the aisle is the 1867 Crawford House coach, a large stagecoach that brought well-to-do summer visitors from a train station to the Crawford House, a resort in New Hampshire’s White Mountains. A period photograph shows about 20 passengers perched precariously in and atop the coach, which had an early shock absorber system that allowed it to sway with the terrain. A vehicle made on Long Island, the East Williston cart, designed and patented by Henry Willis, a farmer, carriage maker and inventor, stands nearby. It had a spring and shafts that reduced road shock and made for a smoother ride, according to the information panel. Willis manufactured about 1,000 of them, but the Valentine Company in Hempstead made this one around 1895. Next to it is a phaeton made in Albany around 1780 and first owned by the Revolutionary War hero Peter Gansevoort. Herman Melville , who was Gansevoort’s grandson, described the phaeton in his 1852 novel “Pierre.” Seeing a real carriage is increasingly rare, Mr. Ruff said. Young people, including students who visit the museum for educational programs, “may be encountering a carriage for the very first time,” he said. “There are more of those as we move forward in time,” he said, “many people who have encountered a carriage only in a movie and have no idea that this physical artifact still exists and is important to treasure.”",

    "source": "Ehud Olmert, Israeli Ex-Premier, Is Convicted of Fraud <eos> JERUSALEM — Ehud Olmert, the former Israeli prime minister who was forced from office under a cloud of corruption, was convicted on Monday of fraud and breach of trust in a retrial of a case involving an American businessman, whose sensational testimony in a Jerusalem court in 2008 was instrumental in Mr. Olmert’s downfall. This was Mr. Olmert’s third conviction on corruption charges since 2012, and he is already facing jail time. The American businessman, Morris Talansky , said at the time of his testimony that he had provided Mr. Olmert with about $150,000 over 13 years, mostly in cash stuffed into envelopes, an assertion Mr. Olmert vehemently denied. Mr. Talansky, known as Moshe, had said that much of the money was earmarked for election campaigns but that some was for Mr. Olmert’s personal expenses. The prosecution said then that the money had been funneled to Mr. Olmert from 1992, when he first ran for mayor of Jerusalem, to late 2005, when he was minister of industry and trade. He became prime minister in early 2006, and his three-year tenure of that office was dogged by police investigations. Court documents subsequently said that Mr. Talansky had transferred a total of about $600,000 to Mr. Olmert, including a small amount in donations from Mr. Talansky’s relatives. “The battle against corruption is long and stubborn,” a lawyer for the prosecution, Uri Korb, told reporters outside the courtroom after the verdict on Monday. “It takes a long time, but, at long last, justice prevails.” He added, “Seven years after Moshe Talansky’s testimony, the court determined that Olmert certainly got envelopes of money and that his behavior was breach of trust and damaged public trust and is true corruption.” Eyal Rosovsky, a lawyer for Mr. Olmert, said the defense team was “very disappointed” with the ruling and would decide whether to appeal after studying the verdict. Mr. Olmert left the court building without making any statement. He is due to be sentenced in May. The court said that the maximum prison term for fraud under aggravating circumstances, which Mr. Olmert was found guilty of, is five years. Monday’s conviction in the Jerusalem District Court came a year after Mr. Olmert was convicted of taking bribes in another case involving the construction of a huge housing complex in Jerusalem. A judge sentenced Mr. Olmert to six years in prison in that case, dashing any hopes the former prime minister might have had of a political comeback. The start of that sentence has been postponed pending an appeal. Mr. Olmert was acquitted in July 2012 of corruption charges in the Talansky case and in another case involving travel expenses. At the time, a panel of three judges ruled unanimously that the evidence did not prove beyond doubt that Mr. Olmert had acted with criminal intent in the Talansky case. They said that Mr. Talansky was a problematic witness whose testimony proved correct in part while also containing statements that were “incorrect and even false.” Mr. Olmert was convicted of breach of trust in a separate matter in 2012, but it was the least serious of the charges he faced at the time, and he was not sentenced to prison. The retrial in the Talansky case came after Shula Zaken, Mr. Olmert’s longtime aide and confidante, became a state witness and testified against him, providing the police with her diaries and tapes she had made of apparently incriminating conversations she had had with Mr. Olmert. According to the latest court documents, Mr. Talansky provided $153,950 from 2003 to 2005 for a fund run by another Olmert aide while Mr. Olmert was serving as minister of industry and trade. Twice during that period, money from the fund was used to supplement Ms. Zaken’s salary. “Talansky and others gave Olmert money for years as a political contribution,” the court documents said, adding, “Olmert made private and even forbidden use of it” by giving Ms. Zaken, his office manager and a public servant, “tens of thousands of dollars.” Mr. Olmert came to a verbal agreement with Ms. Zaken under which she would receive money annually from the fund in return for continuing to work for Mr. Olmert. Eli Zohar, a high-profile lawyer who represented Mr. Olmert in this case and previous ones, told reporters outside the courtroom on Monday that Ms. Zaken’s tape recordings were “selective” and that many parts of the conversations were missing. When Mr. Talansky testified against Mr. Olmert in 2008, he said, among other things, that the money he gave Mr. Olmert included at least $25,000 meant for a vacation in Italy and almost $5,000 to cover Mr. Olmert’s bill at a Washington hotel because Mr. Olmert’s own credit card was “maxed out.” Mr. Talansky added that some of the money was intended as a loan but was never repaid.",

    "source": "Eleanor R. Adair, Microwave Safety Researcher, Dies at 86 <eos> Eleanor R. Adair, a scientist who spent decades exposing monkeys and eventually people (including herself) to microwave radiation to determine whether it posed serious health risks — she concluded, emphatically and somewhat controversially, that it did not — died on April 20 in Hamden, Conn. She was 86. The cause was complications of a stroke, her daughter, Margaret Adair Quinn, said. In the early 1970s, Dr. Adair, who had done her doctoral work in sensory psychology, was pursuing an interesting but not necessarily provocative topic: how people and animals react physiologically to external heat sources. Yet over the next three decades — after her research led her to study heat generated through microwave radiation, which is used in microwave ovens and emitted at low levels by things like cellphones and electrical transmission lines — Dr. Adair became an increasingly prominent and firm voice of assurance that microwave radiation posed no health risk. “All the emphasis that we need more research on power line fields, cellphones, police radar — this involves billions of dollars that could be much better spent on other health problems,” Dr. Adair said in an interview with The New York Times in 2001. “Because there is really nothing there.” For some people close to the issue, those were fighting words. Even as numerous studies have found that microwave ovens are safe and many scientists say there is no evidence that cellphones cause cancer or other health problems, the rising use of cellphones, wireless Internet signals and some medical and military devices has continued to raise questions about their risk. Last year, a panel of the World Health Organization listed microwave radiation as “possibly carcinogenic.” In March, the Federal Communications Commission announced that it would review its standards for cellphone use for the first time since 1996. Some scientists do not use the term microwave radiation because they are concerned it is misleading and scares people unnecessarily. Microwave radiation is far weaker than the radiation in X-rays or gamma rays. Advocates for more research count Dr. Adair in to a camp that focuses too much on heat or thermal effects from microwaves and is too quick to dismiss other ways microwaves might affect health. “There’s something going on, and the question is what that is and whether it’s dangerous,” said Louis Slesin, the editor of Microwave News , a Web site that is often skeptical of the role industry and the military play in influencing health standards related to the issue. “Don’t let anyone tell you they know the answer to that question.” Although Dr. Adair said she did not receive money from cellphone makers or industries whose products released microwave radiation, she served for five years late in her career as a senior scientist at the Air Force Research Laboratory in San Antonio. The Air Force uses radar that emits microwaves. Dr. Adair was indisputably an innovator in studying microwave radiation, work she began in the mid-1970s while a fellow at the John B. Pierce Laboratory in New Haven. First with squirrel monkeys and then with human volunteers, she placed subjects in a chamber into which she released relatively high levels of microwaves for about 45 minutes, followed by a cool-down period. She focused on what impact the heat generated by microwaves might have — and she said she never found much more than perspiration. She said the monkeys and the people mostly enjoyed the experience. “Particularly if the environment is cool, they love it when the field comes on,” she told The Times. She said: “It is very easy to sense it and it feels good. If they are in a warm environment, and the field is strong they may start to sweat and they may feel quite uncomfortable. They always have an option of getting out of the chamber at any time, saying, ‘I’ve had enough.’ ” Richard A. Tell, who consults for cellular companies and other industries and who served with Dr. Adair on a committee of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers that helps set standards for permissible microwave levels, said she “did the first and only studies that have ever been done so far in which humans were studied under controlled conditions.” Eleanor Campbell Reed was born on Nov. 28, 1926, in Arlington, Mass. Her father owned a Dodge dealership near Boston and her mother worked as a fashion illustrator before she married. She graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1948 and received her doctorate from the University of Wisconsin in 1955. In 1952 she married Robert K. Adair, who would later become a prominent physicist at Yale. Mr. Adair became involved in his wife’s work in her later years and sometimes appeared with her at conferences. Besides her daughter, survivors include her husband; her son, Douglas; two grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. “She would always be the first human subject in all of her experiments,” including those involving exposure to microwaves, her daughter said. “She said it was absolutely the most comfortable heat that she ever experienced. She described it once as like having the sun come out — you just suddenly feel all warm and cozy. You’re warm on the inside, not overly hot on the outside.”",

    "source": "Donald Trump Asks for Evangelicals’ Support and Questions Hillary Clinton’s Faith <eos> Donald J. Trump met privately with evangelicals on Tuesday in New York, asking for their support and questioning Hillary Clinton’s faith. Before meeting with a larger group, Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, spoke to a small number of evangelical leaders from around the country, and, according to video posted to Twitter by a minister in attendance, Mr. Trump said that “we don’t know anything about Hillary in terms of religion. Now, she’s been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there’s no — there’s nothing out there.” In response to Mr. Trump’s comment, the Clinton campaign released a statement from Deborah Fikes, who had been an executive adviser to the World Evangelical Alliance. “Mr. Trump’s proposals are not just un-Christian — they’re un-American and at odds with the values our country holds dearest,” her statement read. Ms. Fikes also stated that Mrs. Clinton, whom she said was known as Sister Hillary by organizations she worked with, “is embraced by many evangelical sister churches as a trustworthy and respected political leader because she lives the Golden Rule in her private life and in her public policies.” In response to whether Mr. Trump was questioning Mrs. Clinton’s faith, Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump’s spokeswoman, said there was “no intention” of doing so. Instead, Ms. Hicks said, Mr. Trump “should be praised” for responding to a question about Mrs. Clinton’s faith by saying that he was not aware of Mrs. Clinton’s ties to religion. Mrs. Clinton, a Methodist, has rarely talked about her faith on the campaign trail, but at a rally in January in Iowa, she offered a lengthy reply to a question about her Christianity. “My study of the Bible, my many conversations with people of faith, has led me to believe the most important commandment is to love the Lord with all your might and to love your neighbor as yourself, and that is what I think we are commanded by Christ to do,” she said. Her support of Planned Parenthood and of abortion rights, however, clashes with the views of many socially conservative Christians. It was on these issues that many of the evangelicals sought assurances from Mr. Trump, telling him that they wanted to see him choose a socially conservative running mate with a good relationship to the Christian community, eight members of the group said at a news conference after the meeting. Mr. Trump has seemed to struggle at times in his attempts to court the evangelical vote. In November, Mr. Trump scheduled a news conference saying that a large group of black pastors would endorse him, but the group replied that although they were willing to listen to him, they were not ready to endorse. Mr. Trump canceled the news conference for a private meeting instead, then called an impromptu news conference after the meeting, where none of the pastors offered a formal endorsement. On Tuesday, one attendee, Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, said she was impressed by three commitments Mr. Trump said he would make if he were elected president. She said he promised to defund Planned Parenthood, to pass H.R. 36, or the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, and to appoint a “pro-life Supreme Court justice.” Attendees were quick to acknowledge that Mr. Trump had not completely bridged a gap with social conservatives and evangelicals. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said that conservatives “don’t completely understand him because he comes a little bit from a different world, but they identify with him.” Mark Gonzales, a pastor and founder of the Hispanic Action Network, said Mr. Trump also might find it difficult to reach out to Hispanics. Mr. Gonzales said he had discussed immigration with Mr. Trump, but concluded that the “conversation will continue.” “The verdict is still out as he continues to try to create that narrative that we hope will be more welcoming, and won’t be as harsh,” Mr. Gonzales said. During the news conference, a reporter asked which of the eight attendees were ready to endorse Mr. Trump. None raised a hand.",

    "source": "Paterno’s Testimony No Longer Admissible <eos> STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — The death of Joe Paterno on Sunday will partly weaken the state’s prosecution of two former university officials who have been charged in connection with the child sexual abuse case involving Jerry Sandusky. Paterno was expected to testify at the trials of Tim Curley, the former Penn State athletic director, and Gary Schultz, the university’s former senior vice president for finance and business. However, it is unclear how much of an effect the lack of that testimony will have on the state’s case against Curley and Schultz. Paterno testified before a grand jury in January that he met with Curley and Schultz about Sandusky. Paterno told Curley and Schultz that Mike McQueary, a former graduate assistant, reported to him that he had witnessed a sexual assault involving Sandusky and a boy, known as Victim 2, in the shower of Penn State’s athletic facility in 2002. In a separate meeting, McQueary testified, he told Curley and Schultz about the graphic sexual nature of what he had witnessed. Curley and Schultz were charged for failing to report to the authorities what they knew about the incident. Curley is on administrative leave; Schultz has retired. “Now that Paterno is deceased, this charge will have to stand only on the report by McQueary,” said Geoff Moulton, a former federal prosecutor and an associate professor at Widener School of Law. “With respect to Victim 2 and the charges against Curley and Schultz, McQueary’s testimony, which has always been critical, is even more so.” Paterno’s grand jury testimony is inadmissible, according to several lawyers, because he was not cross-examined in that proceeding. The Sixth Amendment’s confrontation clause guarantees criminal defendants the right to confront the witnesses against them. Wick Sollers, who was Paterno’s lawyer, said in an e-mail that Paterno’s statements before the grand jury constituted his only under-oath testimony in the case. With Paterno’s death, the lawyers for Curley and Schultz no longer have the opportunity to challenge his credibility. Curley and Schultz were also charged with lying to the grand jury, but it appears from the grand jury report that those charges stem only from their account that McQueary did not tell them that the incident was sexual in nature. That would mean Paterno’s inability to take the stand is perhaps not as critical in prosecuting the perjury charges. But his absence could have some effect. “Why would he have told it to Paterno and not told them?” said Howard Bruce Klein, a former federal prosecutor who is a criminal defense lawyer in Philadelphia. “McQueary becomes more credible when you hear Paterno tell his version of it. On the perjury charge, I would say Paterno would be a corroborating witness.” It is unknown whether the Pennsylvania attorney general has uncovered additional evidence that would bolster the case against Curley and Schultz. A spokesman for the attorney general’s office said that there would be no comment about the case. Sandusky, a former Penn State defensive coordinator, has been charged with more than 50 counts of sexual abuse against boys. Paterno’s failure to report to the authorities what he knew about the 2002 incident contributed to the Board of Trustees’ decision to fire him Nov. 9, in his 46th season as the coach. He was not charged in the case. There will be public viewings of Paterno, who died of lung cancer, on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Pasquerilla Spiritual Center, to which he and his wife made a significant financial contribution in 1998. He will be buried Wednesday, and there will be a public memorial service Thursday at Penn State’s 16,000-seat Bryce Jordan Center.",

    "source": "For Emerging-Markets Investors, a Stronger Comeback <eos> UNTIL recently, emerging-markets funds have looked a lot like commodity funds. When the prices for raw goods tumbled last fall, emerging-markets funds fell on a nearly identical trajectory. When commodity prices picked up this spring, these funds rose along with them. But in the third quarter, emerging-markets funds made a stronger comeback than either natural resources funds, which own stocks, or commodity funds, which use futures contracts to bet on rising commodity prices. Many developing economies like Brazil are based on commodity exports, and rapidly growing countries like China and India are stoking the global demand for steel, coal and soybeans. Investment strategists point out, though, that many emerging markets benefit whenever there is demand for their manufactured products — while commodity investors make money only when the prices for raw materials rise. “Emerging-markets funds are closely aligned with commodities, but they do have some additional exposure, certainly to technology and manufacturing,” said Jeff Tjornehoj, a senior research analyst at Lipper, the fund tracker. He said that there was a lot of overlap between these types of funds, though, and that some investors who owned both might have less portfolio diversification than they thought. To be sure, all three categories have regained ground since the global markets hit bottom in March. But only the emerging-markets fund category finished the third quarter higher than it had been a year earlier. An investor who put $1,000 into an emerging-markets fund on Sept. 30, 2008, would have had $1,167, on average, a year later, according to Lipper. But a $1,000 investment in a typical commodities fund a year ago would have been worth around $900 at the end of September. And a similar investment in a natural resources stock fund would have been worth $828. Edward E. Yardeni, an independent investment strategist, said that China had kick-started the global economic recovery when it created a huge public works program last fall, and that he thought developing countries would continue to lead the way. “That’s very positive for commodities,” he added, “because these emerging economies spend a great deal on roads and bridges and airports, and their consumers are spending more on homes and cars.” Mr. Yardeni said that with commodity prices already driven up, he would rather own emerging-markets stocks at this point. Most commodity prices, he said, accurately reflect current supply and demand — except for oil, which he said was more expensive than it should be because of concerns about geopolitical risks. He added that current prices would allow both commodity exporters like Brazil and importers like China to prosper. But Mr. Yardeni did not object to the idea of an individual investor owning both a commodity fund and an emerging-markets fund in the same portfolio, “as long as you know that you’re doubling down on the same fundamental trade.” Gonzalo Pangaro, the manager of the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Stock fund, predicted that the gap between the growth rates of the developed world and the developing world would widen over the next decade. “I think it will take the developed world some time to deleverage,” he said. Mr. Pangaro, who previously managed the T. Rowe Price Latin America fund, has put a strong emphasis on Latin America, which makes up 28 percent of the emerging-markets fund, and particularly on Brazil, at 18 percent of the portfolio. Petrobras, the Brazilian state-run oil company, at 6.2 percent of the portfolio, is the fund’s largest holding. “We’ve owned Petrobras for a very long time,” Mr. Pangaro said, “but in the energy and materials sector, we generally focus on midcaps and small caps.” The portfolio does not hedge the currencies of countries in which it invests. So investors will be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, including those for the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. The fund rose 21.7 percent in the third quarter and returned 12.5 percent in the 12 months through September. The Van Eck Emerging Markets fund also does not hedge for currency risk, and it tilts toward small and midsize companies rather than the large, formerly state-owned companies that dominate the stock markets in many developing countries. David Semple, the portfolio manager, said that small companies were more likely to benefit from rising consumption in their local markets, which should bolster demand for commodities, “whether it’s steel for cars or crocodile skin for Gucci shoes.” In the energy and basic materials sectors, this has led Mr. Semple to focus on some stocks that would not be on the radar screen of many natural resources funds, which tend to own larger energy companies. For example, the second-largest holding in the Van Eck fund, recently at 2.2 percent of the portfolio, is KazMunaiGas Exploration Production, which is majority owned by the government of Kazakhstan. “It has decent assets, and cash in the bank,” Mr. Semple said. But he said the key attraction was its relationship with the government, which gives it preferential rights for oil and gas drilling in Kazakhstan, a central Asian country with vast energy reserves. Another large holding is the KNM Group, which is based in Malaysia and works on refinery projects for major oil and gas producers worldwide. Its shares trade only on the Malaysian stock exchange. Van Eck Emerging Markets rose 25.1 percent in third quarter and 23.45 percent during the last 12 months. THE similarities between emerging markets and commodities are also apparent in the world of exchange-traded funds , said Paul Justice, the E.T.F. strategist at Morningstar, the fund tracker. Among E.T.F.’s owing emerging-markets stocks, Mr. Justice says, he likes the Vanguard Emerging Markets E.T.F. because of its diverse portfolio and low cost. It rose 21.2 percent in the third quarter and charges 0.2 percent in annual expenses. If investors already own one or two emerging-markets funds, he said, they might consider an E.T.F. focused on small-cap stocks, like WisdomTree Emerging Markets Small-Cap Dividend. It was up 22.9 percent in the quarter. But after six months of robust returns, Mr. Justice cautioned investors not to expect emerging markets to continue to grow by leaps and bounds. “I’m not saying that it’s going to go negative,” he said. “But I’m not predicting anything like the returns that it’s had this year.”",

    "source": "To Reduce Costs, Warner Brothers Closing 2 Film Divisions <eos> LOS ANGELES — Warner Brothers announced Thursday that it would shut two troubled film divisions, a cost-cutting move rooted in the changing economics of the specialty film business. Picturehouse, known for art films like “Pan’s Labyrinth,” and Warner Independent Pictures, which distributed “March of the Penguins,” will cease operations in the coming weeks, Warner Brothers said. About 70 people will lose their jobs. What will happen to the projects in development at the two companies must still be decided, said Alan F. Horn, the studio’s president. “This reflects the reality of a changing marketplace and our need to prudently run our businesses with increased efficiencies,” Warner said in a statement. Together, Picturehouse and Warner Independent released 12 films in 2007. Mr. Horn said that Warner would release “overall fewer movies” but declined to specify a goal. The two labels were intended to tap a growing market for cerebral, low-budget films — and to make Warner competitive at the Oscars. But the company was late to the game. By the time Warner Independent was founded in 2003, every other major studio had already established a specialty division. Warner Independent never found a niche and suffered from executive infighting. Meanwhile, a glut of movies in the marketplace — about 600 films were released in 2007, up from 450 in 2002 — has dented the profitability and reliability of specialty divisions. No longer can these units produce films on the cheap, apply a little marketing and watch the cash roll in. As competition has increased, advertising costs have soared. Recent flops by Warner Independent include “In the Valley of Elah,” which took in a scant $6.7 million at the box office. Picturehouse managed to squeeze two Oscars out of “La Vie en Rose” in February, but the picture sold only about $10 million in tickets in North America. In an interview, Mr. Horn said that Warner, part of Time Warner, remained committed to making specialty films, though he would not say how many. “We are not abandoning the independent marketplace,” he said. The closures come after Time Warner’s recent decision to fold its New Line studio into Warner Brothers, eliminating 500 jobs. Under this configuration, New Line will use the main studio’s infrastructure to release about six films a year. Warner will release the last pictures from the two labels over the next six months. Picturehouse, created in 2005 after Time Warner acquired Newmarket Films, the company behind “The Passion of the Christ,” is set to release a remake of “The Women” in September. Warner Independent’s releases include “Towelhead,” about a Lebanese teenager growing up in Texas.",

    "source": "Maine Loses His Composure and the Mets Lose a Game in Chicago <eos> CHICAGO, Aug. 4 — There were still six innings of baseball to be played Saturday when the Mets lost. Their afternoon unraveled in the time it took for John Maine to pound his glove against his hip, a visceral reaction to what would have been an inning-ending call at first base that instead went against his team. Maine faced five more batters. He did not retire any of them, and the Cubs rolled to a six-run third inning that fueled their 6-2 victory at Wrigley Field. When Maine was replaced by Aaron Sele, after Jacque Jones lined his 44th pitch of the inning for a run-scoring single, he walked slowly toward the dugout. He stared at the ground, cap pulled low on his head, as if he knew he had done something wrong. On a certain level, Maine could tolerate six runs, four hits, three walks and a hit batsman. But he could not handle what he viewed as lapses in concentration: after the close call at first, and during the previous at-bat, when Alfonso Soriano hit a comebacker that Maine did not field cleanly, costing him a chance for a double play. “I hurt myself,” Maine said. For all of Maine’s numerous accomplishments — a team-leading 12 victories and a 2.92 earned run average entering Saturday, for starters — every once in a while he supplies a reminder that he is pitching in only his second full major league season. He has, for the most part, maintained his focus throughout his starts, a problem that plagued him last season. Manager Willie Randolph said, “When you do it for a while and then get away from it, you have to get back to it.” Maine’s counterpart on the mound, the left-hander Ted Lilly, stymied the Mets over seven and two-thirds innings, allowing two runs and seven hits and striking out eight before leaving to a standing ovation. Lilly had spent all but his rookie season in the American League, and the Mets’ starting lineup had a combined 24 at-bats against him. Moises Alou made the only lasting impression on Lilly, slamming two bases-empty home runs to double his season output. Even with Sele, Jorge Sosa and Scott Schoeneweis combining to hold the Cubs scoreless the rest of the game, the Mets could not bail out Maine. Shortly after the game, Maine sat engrossed in a conversation with the pitching coach Rick Peterson. When that ended, Maine stood in front of his locker, arms folded across his chest, and did not much care to re-create how the miserable third inning unfolded. “I couldn’t find it,” Maine said. “I kept trying to find it, but it wasn’t there.” The first two Cubs reached base in the third, but Maine recovered to retire the next two hitters. Up came the No. 2 hitter, Ryan Theriot, who tapped a slow grounder toward José Reyes. The league’s other shortstops surely would have gotten to the ball, but Reyes is among a few with an arm strong enough to make a play on Theriot. The first-base umpire, Marty Foster, called Theriot safe, although slow-motion television replays appeared to show that Reyes’s throw arrived a half-step ahead. “The boys in here were saying we had him, but at the moment I couldn’t tell,” first baseman Carlos Delgado said. Standing on the edge of the mound, Maine recoiled when the call was made, but it was only one run, and he had two outs. But Maine walked Derrek Lee on four pitches to load the bases. He walked Aramis Ramírez to force in a run. He hit Cliff Floyd on the right knee to force in another. Singles by Mark DeRosa and Jones doubled the Cubs’ lead to 6-0 and knocked out Maine after his shortest start of 37 as a Met. “That was the first time all year in a key situation with runners on when I couldn’t help myself and get out of it,” Maine said. “I know that tomorrow I’m going to wake up and think about it.” INSIDE PITCH The longer Paul Lo Duca sits, the more he wonders why. But Lo Duca, who missed his sixth consecutive game Saturday while recovering from a right hamstring injury, does not make the decision. The man who does, Willie Randolph, said Lo Duca would be re-evaluated in New York on Tuesday; thus he will miss another chance to catch Tom Glavine’s potential 300th victory Sunday night. “I appreciate him wanting to play,” Randolph said. “But I’m the manager. I have to be smart enough not to react to the will of the player.”... Damion Easley said his head still hurt a few hours after he fell backward against the brick wall in right field to catch a fly ball hit by Aramis Ramírez in the second inning. ... Randolph scrawled the initials “B.R.” on the left side of his cap to honor Bill Robinson, the hitting coach of the 1986 Mets and a mentor of Randolph’s, who was buried Saturday morning in Washington Township, N.J.",

    "source": "A Desert War on ISIS, Fought From a Floating City <eos> ABOARD THE U.S.S. CARL VINSON, in the Persian Gulf — More than a dozen Navy F/A-18 warplanes roar off this aircraft carrier every day to attack Islamic State targets in support of Iraqi troops battling to regain ground lost to the militants in June. These Navy pilots face an array of lethal risks during their six-hour round-trip missions. Surface-to-air missiles and other enemy fire lurk below, as the downing of an Iraqi military helicopter late Friday underscored. About 60 percent of the aircrews are still learning the ropes on their first combat tours. The United States-led coalition improvises how the Iraqis call in airstrikes: Iraqi troops talk by radio to American controllers at Iraqi command centers, who in turn talk to the Navy pilots to help pinpoint what to hit. Senior commanders have said that placing American spotters with the Iraqi troops would be more effective, but they have yet to recommend that step knowing that President Obama opposes it. In the initial weeks of an air campaign that started in August, Iraq’s troops were tentative. Fighters from the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL, quickly learned not to move in large numbers to avoid being struck. Three out of every four missions still return with their bombs for lack of approved targets. But in recent days, the Iraqis have been advancing, forcing ISIS to fight more in the open. The airstrikes are severing the militants’ supply lines, killing some top leaders and crimping their ability to pump and ship the oil that they control. “It wasn’t going so well there for a while, but the momentum seems to have reversed,” said Cmdr. Eric Doyle, a 41-year-old F/A-18 Hornet pilot from Houston who also flew combat missions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. About one quarter of the 1,200 total airstrikes in Iraq and Syria so far have been flown off a carrier — the other missions began from bases around the gulf — an enduring symbol of American power in the Middle East. After ISIS fighters rolled south into Mosul six months ago and threatened Baghdad, the Pentagon rushed the carrier George H.W. Bush to the Persian Gulf from the coast of Pakistan, where it was flying missions in support of American troops in Afghanistan. Iraqi Army Retakes Government Complex in Central Ramadi Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State. Within two days, the carrier was sending surveillance and reconnaissance flights over Iraq and Syria. It was weeks before the United States ironed out arrangements with regional allies to allow land-based planes to carry out strikes. The Vinson relieved the Bush in mid-October, and will stay until next spring. “You don’t have to ask anybody for permission to use a carrier,” said Vice Adm. John W. Miller, commander of the Navy’s Fifth Fleet in Bahrain. “It’s five acres of sovereign U.S. territory.” This ship has an unusual place in the annals of the campaign against terrorism. Some of the first airstrikes of the Afghan war in October 2001 were by jets from the Vinson; nearly a decade later, it was here that Navy SEALs brought Osama bin Laden’s body after the raid in Pakistan, and buried it at sea after religious rites on the lower hangar deck. The flight deck is the bustling hub of this nuclear-powered behemoth, which is home to 5,200 sailors and officers for nearly 10 months at a time. Sailors in light helmets and goggles, mostly in their early 20s, scurry about in vests and long-sleeve shirts color-coded to their jobs — red shirts handle bombs, purple shirts handle fuel, yellow shirts handle the flights. Racks of bombs and missiles rise from elevators below deck amid the din. MH-60 Seahawk search-and-rescue helicopters buzz overhead on their way out to sea. It is like a crowded suburban parking lot, except these are $57 million jets taxiing for takeoff with 500-pound laser-guided bombs tucked under their wings. The slightest misstep around these high-performance jets and turboprop planes could be fatal. “Beware of Jet Blast, Propellers and Rotors” is emblazoned in large yellow letters on the ship’s superstructure, lest anyone forget. It is a dangerous business, even when the ship is not at war. In September, while training in the western Pacific, two F/A-18s from the Vinson collided in midair soon after takeoff. One pilot was rescued in the accident, but the other was killed. His body was never found in waters nearly three miles deep. About 20 percent of the 100 daily flights are strike missions into Iraq and Syria. The others are a mix of training, supply, reconnaissance and other flights, usually between 10:30 a.m. and 11 p.m. About an hour before takeoff, fighter pilots in flight suits stride to their planes for a final inspection. Tiny black bombs are stenciled below the cockpit for each weapon dropped from that aircraft. A giant steam-powered catapult then hurls the jets off the ship, from a dead start to more than 125 miles an hour in less than three seconds. Video How has ISIS, a 21st-century terrorist organization with a retrograde religious philosophy, spread from Iraq to Syria, Libya and beyond? By then, the pilots have studied their routes, the weather and the targets assigned by an American air command center in Qatar, a tiny gulf state. Targeting specialists have selected bombs big enough to do the job but mindful of the risk to civilians. The allied jets are operating under some of the strictest rules intended to prevent civilian casualties in modern warfare. “If there’s any doubt, we do not drop ordnance,” said Capt. Matt Leahey, a 44-year-old Naval Academy graduate from Lewiston, Me., who commands the 2,100 personnel and 63 aircraft in the carrier’s air wing. The Vinson has steamed to the northern part of the gulf to shorten flight times as much as possible, but it is still 450 miles to Baghdad and much farther to Syria. The F/A-18s burn 5,700 gallons of fuel on a typical mission, and pilots must refuel in midair three or four times. The jets fly well above 20,000 feet, out of the range of most antiaircraft guns. ISIS has surface-to-air missiles and has downed a few Iraqi helicopters, so pilots cannot fly as low as they would like to get the best look at their targets. “Manpads are a real threat,” said Commander Doyle, referring to Man-Portable Air Defense Systems. In some cases, pilots are striking specific, planned targets such as headquarters buildings. But most of the Vinson’s missions are targets of opportunity while safeguarding Iraqi troops below. Pilots fly over designated grid areas, typically 60 miles square, searching for fighters, artillery and other signs of the enemy. An aerial armada of surveillance planes with names like Joint Stars and Rivet Joint track militant movements on the ground and intercept their electronic communications, feeding a steady stream of information to pilots. “It can be pretty boring, then all of sudden it gets heated and you’ve got a whole lot of work to do in 120 seconds,” said Commander Doyle, who has flown eight strike missions so far. “We’re trying to find things and kill them.” Working with the American air controllers in the Iraqi command centers — special operations troops in contact with Iraqi or Kurdish ground troops — pilots say they are aiming to weaken ISIS’ war machine in a fight they caution could take months or even years. “We’re taking away the enemy’s ability to reinforce and resupply,” said Lt. Adam Bryan, 31, an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot from northwestern Connecticut. “It’s a pretty dynamic situation.”",

Gmail, initially released as an invitation-only service in 2004 , is Google’s official web-based email service and a competitor to Microsoft’s Outlook.com (formerly Hotmail.com), Yahoo Mail and Apple’s iCloud mail service, among others. Inbox, first released as an invitation-only service in 2014 , is a program that attempts to sort and organize your Gmail messages into logical groupings so they are easier to manage — especially on a mobile device. You do not need an invitation to use either service anymore, but you need to have a Gmail address to use Inbox. Google makes both a Gmail app and an Inbox app for devices running Android and iOS. If you like the way Inbox organizes your messages, you can also use it with your desktop web browser after you have set it up on your mobile gadget; point your Chrome, Firefox or Safari browser to inbox.google.com to use it there. If you have both apps installed and set up, your messages (and the actions you take with them) are synced between Gmail and Inbox . Messages you archive, delete, create or mark as spam are handled the same way in both apps, no matter which one you are using at the time. Some features appear in only one app, though. You need to create your vacation response messages and certain filters in Gmail, while Inbox Reminders are not visible in Gmail. People who like the traditional approach to dealing with email may prefer Gmail’s more straightforward message view. However, those who like anything that saves time — or automatically organizes information for quick perusal on the go — may favor Inbox. If you want to get to know the newer app a little better, Google has created an Inbox Help Center online and has a brief demo video on YouTube .",

    "source": "Raising Ghosts Long Thought to Be Laid to Rest <eos> BERLIN — The air filled with noise, and the aircraft’s payload spiraled downward, sometimes black against a clear blue sky, sometimes catching a glint of sunlight. The moment was meant to revive modern Europe’s fading memories not simply of war, but of conflict so enormous that entire cities were razed by aerial bombardment in the rush for conquest or the slide to defeat before peace in 1945. But here, on a late August evening in 2010, the airplane was not an American B-17 or a British Lancaster or a Soviet Ilyushin — airplanes from the three air forces that bombed the German capital at various stages in World War II. And the payload was not hostile, either. Coinciding with a regular all-night opening of the city’s museums, the “bombing” was an airdrop from a helicopter of 100,000 poems by 80 writers printed on silvery bookmarks — replicating similar rains of verse over cities once shattered from the air, Guernica, Spain, and Warsaw among them. Conceived by Chilean and German artists, it was a kind of street theater designed to inspire musing on what has really changed in the 65 years since the end of World War II and what has simply been transplanted to other arenas of conflict. Berlin is a good place for such rumination. The city’s very architecture — rebuilt apartment houses interspersed with the ponderous, imperial baroque of an older Germany — offers testimony to the postwar ruin presided over by those who inherited a divided city in 1945. Indeed, the sight of the cards fluttering across the ornate facade of the Berliner Dom, the Berlin Cathedral, had a particular poignancy: The building’s grand cupola was destroyed by Allied firebombing in 1944, only to be rebuilt in the postwar era. The city, though, is not always so eager to resuscitate its history. Barely seen amid the frenetic construction since the end of communism, traces of the Berlin Wall — the very emblem of the Cold War in a divided Europe — linger in the rebuilt city center like chimera, strips of sometimes anonymous cobblestone along its erstwhile route. Was this the cusp of East and West? Was this the concrete enforcer of global division with its death strip, enfiladed by machine guns in the watchtowers before the wall came down in 1989 and a reunified Germany began burying its memory under a forest of glittery high-rises? Only a fraction of its 105-kilometer, or 65-mile, length remains, some as an open-air art gallery. “They should have kept a whole stretch of the Wall, 500 meters, so people would see what it was like,” said Harry Hampel, a photojournalist who has chronicled Berlin’s before and after in black and white and sells his work from the taxi cab he drives to fund the enterprise. Then, finally, there is the new Berlin rubbing shoulders with the old. As nations have made the voyage from world war to cold war to a war of hearts and faiths, so Berlin has moved into a new century, seeking the self-confidence to cease apologizing so frequently for a past that will not fully release it. Last month, the defense minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, announced plans for a military overhaul including the abolition of the draft — an acknowledgement of NATO’s changed landscape since the end of the Cold War. No longer do military strategists contemplate tank battles across the north German plain or massed infantry maneuvers along the Iron Curtain. Instead, the effort to combat the Taliban and Al Qaeda has supplanted the Cold War as the existential fight propelling a new generation since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 (although its seeds were sown much earlier). Germany itself has sent 4,500 soldiers to Afghanistan — an unpopular deployment that set the needs of the U.S.-led coalition ahead of the nation’s profound aversion to the militarism of its past. And that remote conflict mirrors divisions closer to home. Just as jihadists depict Western soldiers as unholy warriors, so, too, in the West, suspicion of Islam seems often to trump government protestations of evenhandedness toward the Muslim minorities that have become part of Europe’s social fabric. President Barack Obama has signaled a drawdown of U.S. forces from Afghanistan in mid-2011 after formally ending the U.S. combat role in Iraq. But it seems unlikely that Western leaders will find a way anytime soon to unlock a riddle as baffling and enduring as the Kremlinology of the past: How do affluent Western societies counter the gravitational pull of radical Islam that stirs not only in distant Muslim societies but also among their own citizens? Only this month, a German newspaper reported that a German citizen was arrested by U.S. troops in Afghanistan, accused of belonging to a group of Islamists from Hamburg who had traveled to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area in 2009 to train as militants. Just a few days earlier, Thilo Sarrazin, a board member at the German central bank, ignited a fury over an assertion that Germans could become “strangers in their own land” as the land’s large Turkish minority expands. Those might have seemed familiar words in the vocabulary of fear generated by Europe’s unresolved debate over immigration — the common strand linking such disparate phenomena as the expulsion of Roma from France or Britain’s resistance to the undocumented arrival of fugitives from Afghanistan or Iraq. But, in a new book, Mr. Sarrazin, who has since quit the bank under intense political pressure, also argued that all Jews share a common gene differentiating them from other people. Berlin, of course, is a city of monuments to a past that struck fear within and far beyond its frontiers. So dropping poems among those symbols the other day betokened a newer striving for a kind of normalcy — for fun, even. As the cards fell from the sky, children scrambled to catch them in midflight or retrieve them from the cobblestones while older citizens looked on with benign and sometimes inscrutable expressions. One poem by Timo Berger, called “What Comes From Above,” described the cards of verse sailing “into your hand, with a smile.” It was not ever thus.",

    "source": "For French and Italian Soccer, Dark Days Could Lie Ahead <eos> The four-year cycle of a World Cup is almost run. Italy and France, who contested an unedifying final in Berlin in 2006, appear to be preparing some of the same old cast, with more bad odor along the way. Zinédine Zidane, the most marvellous player of his generation until he chose to end his career with that infamous head butt in Berlin, is retired. But Franck Ribéry, the man who would be the new Zidane, is among the players being questioned by the police investigating a prostitution racket involving underage girls. That, so far, is simply a story of suspicion, but the leak comes at the worst imaginable time. Raymond Domenech, the same France national coach as four years ago, is about to set up camp for South Africa 2010 with, reportedly, four of his squad liable to be wanted for further police questioning. Italy, meanwhile, is truly back in the old routine. It won the last World Cup even as the Calciopoli, the investigation into referee tampering, was running through leading clubs like Juventus and AC Milan. Italy won the World Cup with two-thirds of its players coming from clubs implicated in those trials. And it won at a time when spectator violence, including murders, threatened to close down some of Italy’s stadiums. Roll on four years, and Calciopoli is back in front of magistrates with yet more claims of corruption, yet more evidence from tapped telephone calls leaked to the media and about to be heard in court. And, as the derby Sunday in Rome showed, the crowd violence has not gone away. This could hardly be more ill-timed. Marcello Lippi has been restored as the national coach of Italy and is intent on taking many of his 2006 World Cup winners to the next tournament, implying that few younger Italians have impressed him in the four intervening years. There has been change in Italy because Juventus has not totally recovered from being dumped down a division and made to work its way back up. AC Milan, Silvio Berlusconi’s club, has run short on cash and sold its brightest star, Kaká, to Real Madrid. There is a fresh challenger for Serie A. Inter, whose team is predominantly Argentine and Brazilian, has been eased off the top by Roma, which achieved a remarkable comeback to beat its neighbor Lazio, 2-1, in the stadium they share in Rome. There was, once again, serious violence. One fan had his throat slit, others suffered knife wounds, a few were under arrest. Players fought and scrapped, tempers were lost — a normal day in the Olympic stadium, Rome’s modern day Coliseum. Even Inter Milan, the club that benefited from the Calciopoli trial, is under suspicion. Its accuser, it has to be said, is Luciano Moggi, the man branded as the biggest manipulator for Juventus. Moggi tells the media, and now the Naples court, that Inter was as involved as all the rest in making the irregular calls to match referees. Oh, what a web of Machiavellian intrigue the Italians make of soccer. Last weekend did provide one moment of absolute purity. It came through a goal of sweet Brazilian magic, by Inter’s right back Maicon as he scored against Juventus and Italy’s No. 1 goalkeeper, Gigi Buffon. We might all need to cling to Maicon’s artistry to retain any sense that the sport is worth the notoriety that sometimes it attracts. Maybe it is the pervasive nature of 24/7 media using, and being used by, the police and rumor mongers. It isn’t just soccer that has changed through easy money and overblown idolatry. Only in make-believe can we imagine ourselves still to be in the era of Arnie Palmer and Jack Nicklaus rather than Tiger Woods. The world has changed, and with it the methods of communication that sometimes blur the lines between fact and fiction around sporting icons. There is substance, but as yet very little fact to the French scandal involving Ribéry et al. His legal representative, Sophie Bottai, sought to put press speculation into perspective on Monday through a statement that read: “Personalities including Franck Ribéry and other players of international fame count among their relationships a person close to the leader of a girls escort network. It is only because of that relationship that they have been, or will be, heard by police investigating this case. “My client was called as a witness, but had no other part in the matter. The matter stops there,” she said. No, it does not, not even in France where a privacy law protects politicians, sports figures and anyone else in the spotlight from media intrusion. On Wednesday, Ribéry is due to play for Bayern Munich against Lyon in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal. He hopes to be at the top of his game, which is a rare occurrence given his perpetual injury breaks — and he might come face to face with Sidney Govou, his fellow striker on the France national team. Govou, too, was named in the investigation into the nightclub near the Champs-Elysées that the police claim was being used as a brothel. Lyon, and Govou’s lawyer, deny he is involved. Ribéry, 27, has two young daughters and converted to Islam when he married their mother. Govou is single, with a 5-year-old daughter. But there are other, younger, French national squad players being named on French Web sites and in print. One of those, currently employed outside of France, is reported to have admitted that he had sex with a prostitute but did not know she was under 18. Jean-Pierre Escalettes, the president of the French soccer federation, told the media: “An investigation is under way. There is nothing else to say at the moment.” He might think that suffices, but in today’s environment, and with the French about to start World Cup camp, it might be easier to cap the outpouring of an Icelandic volcano than put a lid on this story.",

He spins the on-screen design, then flips it upside down to see if all the sides are even. Later, his art teacher, Nicole Zahour, will print the object in plastic on the classroom’s 3-D printer, which during a recent visit was abuzz producing a bracelet made with paper-thin plastic layers. By next week, Julian will hold his vase-like invention in his hands. Forget the days when art classes were strictly about drawing, painting and sculpting. In the last two years, the Rye Arts Center, located in a classic, gray-shingled colonial house in the village of Rye, N.Y., has added classes for children as young as 8 in coding, 3-D printing, computer animation, robotics and even Minecraft, the building game that some parents write off as just another video game. Here, the digital arts are given the same weight as watercolors and clay-making. Image Manipulating a 3-D design. Credit Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times “There’s always going to be a need for traditional arts,” Meg Rodriguez, the executive director of the Rye Arts Center, said. “We’re not trying to change that. But we do want to introduce children to the modern tools for creativity.” Rye isn’t the only art school that has retooled its course offerings in recent years. The Rhode Island School of Design led the charge several years ago when John Maeda, then its president, championed a movement to inject the arts into STEM curriculums (science, technology, engineering and math), arguing that design was a critical component of innovation. A new acronym, Steam, has since caught on, with supporters including members of Congress, the National Science Foundation, school districts around the country and the Department of Education. Many educators maintain that classes that combine technology, engineering and art help students learn how to solve problems and, perhaps more important, think creatively. The Katonah Art Center offers two Steam classes for younger children, as does the Digital Arts Experience in White Plains, which offers several 3-D design and coding classes for youngsters. At the Rye Arts Center, 25 percent of the budget for traditional art programs is now reserved for Steam course offerings. Last year, the center’s darkroom, which was abandoned when digital photography classes became popular several years ago, was transformed into what the school calls its “MakerSpace”: a brightly lit classroom with a high square table at the center covered with a dozen laptops and surrounded by citrine and royal blue metal stools. A large flat-screen TV hangs at the center of the room for teacher demonstrations, and three 3-D printers sit in a row on a back shelf. Also on the shelves are the students’ creations: a robotic dog that was programmed to move; a charming pair of owls printed on the 3-D printer. In a coding class here, the young children weren’t sitting in rows plugging numbers into a computer — they were learning how to build rockets and space stations in Minecraft, a game that is like a digital version of Lego. Sometimes those projects lead to offline discoveries. One 8-year-old student, Ben Fritsche, was taking his space station design from coding class and building it out of cardboard and mirrored tiles in another class called Creative Building. Image A product of the class, which is offered to students as young as 8. Credit Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times Said Ben of his space station: “I thought it would be cool to make it for real.” In Creative Building, children are inspired to think up their dream structure, build it with found materials and often power it with electricity using basic circuitry. One 9-year-old girl, Sydney Ruthazer, is making a fashion house with a runway and pendant lights with beaded drum shades, while another boy is building a copy of his little sister’s nursery school, complete with beeping smoke alarms. The teacher of both the Minecraft and Creative Building classes, Gary McLoughlin, whom the children call Mr. Mack, has developed a bit of a following over the last few years; creative-minded children take his Steam classes at Discover Camp in Hawthorne in the summer and then at the Rye Arts Center during the school year. One Friday in November, he was in the MakerSpace with six boys no older than 10. All were building in Minecraft. A boy named Manuel Marchand had created an underground secret base in the game, and the other boys were trying to find it. When asked how they would use the code they were learning here in class, one boy shrugged, “Build an app.” Mr. McLoughlin said he had heard naysayers over the years assert that digital art was not art at all. All of us, he argued, need to re-examine our ideas about what counts as creativity. “Why does art have to be a framed watercolor hanging in a museum?” Mr. McLoughlin asked. Besides, he added, the art world is already experimenting with the same digital tools as the children in Rye. Case in point: A dress made with a 3-D printer is now hanging in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. “A kid might say he’s not an artist because he can’t draw or paint,” Mr. McLoughlin said. “But if you go into a 3-D world and manipulate structures and print them out, or if you build a rocket in a virtual world and make it take off, it’s still your creation. It’s still your idea. And it’s still art.”",

    "source": "Scores Are Stranded as Ferry Catches Fire Off Greek Coast <eos> VERBANIA, Italy — Italian, Greek and Albanian vessels battled gale-force winds and rough seas early Monday as they struggled to rescue hundreds of passengers stranded on a ferry that caught fire on Sunday off the northwestern coast of Greece en route to Italy. Italian news media reported that the fire broke out on the car deck of the ferry, which was heading to the Italian port of Ancona. The ship was carrying 422 passengers and 56 crew members, according to the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry. The ministry said that 234 of the passengers were Greek and that the ship was also carrying passengers from Albania, Austria, Belgium, France, Georgia, Italy, Switzerland, Syria, Turkey and other countries. Italian officials said that one passenger had died while trying to get off the ship, and a spokeswoman for the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry confirmed that a Greek man had died during the rescue effort. Image Passengers from the Norman Atlantic on Sunday in the harbor of Otranto, Italy. The fire is said to have started on the car deck. Credit Biagio Claudio Longo/European Pressphoto Agency Nearly 200 people remained stranded on the ferry as dawn broke on Monday, while helicopters continued to airlift exhausted passengers to waiting merchant vessels nearby. Some were taken directly to Italian hospitals to be treated for hypothermia. Difficult weather conditions continued to hamper the rescue efforts, which had gone on through the night. Helicopters redoubled their efforts after a navy ship with a helipad reached the ferry on Sunday evening. Another naval vessel was heading to the scene on Monday. An Italian Coast Guard official, Giovanni de Tullio, said on Italian television that stormy weather had been forecast. A container ship carrying 49 passengers from the ferry arrived in the Italian port of Bari on Monday morning. Shortly before 8 a.m., the Italian Navy said that 290 people had been saved, and that another 188 were still on board. “The water is choppy, and it is very cold,” Capt. Riccardo Rizzotto of the Italian Navy said on RAI News, an Italian national broadcaster. “Certainly they’re suffering.” Image Photographs taken from video show the burning ferry adrift off Albania. Credit Italian Navy Throughout the day, ships and helicopters departed from several Italian ports to reach the stricken boat. The ferry, the Norman Atlantic, sails under an Italian flag but was chartered by a Greek company, ANEK Lines. It caught fire about 35 miles north of the Greek island of Corfu after leaving the Greek port of Igoumenitsa early Sunday morning, the charter company said in a statement. It did not say what had caused the fire. A distress call was issued shortly before 5 a.m. on Sunday, requesting that all ships in the channel off Otranto in the Puglia region of Italy assist with the rescue efforts. Italian news media broadcast images of the ship enveloped in smoke. Greece’s merchant marine minister, Miltiadis Varvitsiotis, described the rescue operations as “particularly difficult and complicated,” and the Italian Navy said Sunday evening that the smoke was hampering rescue efforts. Passengers found refuge on the top deck of the ship, according to the navy. But a Greek woman, who gave her name only as Athina, told a Greek television station that she and about 40 other passengers could feel the heat from the fire on the deck before boarding a lifeboat. “The deck was hot; it was burning our feet,” she said. “We couldn’t believe what was happening.” Image The ferry caught fire with 422 passengers and 56 crew members on board. Credit Italian Navy Navy helicopters were used to begin carrying some passengers to safety, and by late Sunday afternoon, the ship was attached to a towboat. Although other ships were responding to the distress call, rescuers warned that it was still a hazardous situation. “The severe weather conditions are still making it difficult for ships to get close, and it’s beginning to be dark,” said an Italian Defense Ministry spokesman, who asked not to be identified according to Italian institutional practices. But by Sunday evening, 10 merchant ships had managed to reach the ferry, and they were taking on passengers, the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry said. Another Greek passenger, Nikos Papatheodosiou, told Greek television that “the wind is pushing us from one side to the other, and we can’t breathe in the smoke.” “Do something to save us,” he begged. “We’ll drown like mice.” In a separate accident in the region, a Turkish cargo ship collided with another merchant vessel and sank off the coast of Italy in the northern Adriatic on Sunday, killing two crew members and leaving four others missing, officials said, according to The Associated Press.",

    "source": "Rockies Give Carlos Gonzalez 7-Year, $80 Million Extension <eos> No team has spent more money this off-season than the Colorado Rockies . Most of it has gone toward re-signing their core players, and the latest beneficiary is the star outfielder Carlos Gonzalez, who has agreed to a seven-year, $80 million extension. The deal, confirmed Tuesday by a person in baseball with knowledge of the contract, is pending a physical. Gonzalez starred for the Rockies in 2010, his first full season, batting a National League-best .336 with 34 home runs and 117 runs batted in . He won a Gold Glove and finished third in the balloting for most valuable player, two slots ahead of shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, who signed a seven-year, $134.5 million extension with Colorado in late November and is under contract through 2020. Gonzalez was not eligible for free agency until after the 2014 season, but Colorado was betting that his value, if he continued to perform, would only escalate. Gonzalez has already been traded twice, including as part of a package Colorado acquired from Oakland for Matt Holliday in 2008, and he seemed to value the stability of a long-term deal. With Gonzalez, 25, on board through 2017 — taking him through his first three years of free agency — the Rockies have two of baseball’s best all-around players locked up at reasonable contracts. The Rockies, who also re-signed the left-hander Jorge De La Rosa and added the utility player Ty Wigginton, have committed about $250 million this winter. TRAINER ARRESTED FOR FRAUD A high-profile baseball trainer in the Dominican Republic who negotiated multimillion-dollar contracts with major league teams for teenage prospects has been arrested there on charges he falsified documents about players’ identities, the Dominican authorities said Tuesday. The arrest is seen as a significant victory for baseball, which has invested millions of dollars in trying to clean up its operations in the Dominican Republic and has urged the government to crack down on the trainers. Baseball officials believe the trainers help falsify prospects’ identities to make them appear younger and more appealing to teams, and are also a source of steroids for prospects. The trainer, Victor Baez, has been on the radar of baseball officials for several years. In 2009, he said in an interview with The New York Times that he routinely injected his teenage players with vitamin B12 because he could not afford to feed them meat. In 2010, Baez had 5 of the top 40 prospects who were eligible to sign with teams after July 2, and all five tested positive for steroids as part of their registration with Major League Baseball. Baez said the positive results were because of a tainted protein shake he had given his players. Baez’s arrest stemmed from an investigation by Major League Baseball, which uncovered that he had falsified documents. Baseball officials turned the investigation over to the Dominican government, which further pursued the matter. “We have been working very hard to implement reforms that will improve the environment for conducting the business of baseball in the Dominican Republic,” Rob Manfred, Major League Baseball’s executive vice president for labor relations, said in a statement. “Today’s action by the Dominican authorities is a positive step that the commissioner’s office truly appreciates.” MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT BUCKNER RETURNS Bill Buckner, the Boston Red Sox player long associated with the team’s former curse, will try to work some managerial magic in Massachusetts. The Brockton Rox of the independent Can-Am League announced Tuesday that Buckner would manage the team this summer. Buckner had 2,715 career hits, but he is most remembered for an error that cost the Red Sox Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. In a statement, Buckner said he was excited to return to Massachusetts. The Rox’s chief executive, Chris Carminucci, praised Buckner’s vast baseball knowledge and called it a “great day” for the Rox. (AP)",

    "source": "Fireplace in a Brooklyn Church Is Drawing Scholars’ Interest <eos> A mystery involving a fireplace in Brooklyn has set off a scholarly stir. At the Greenpoint Reformed Church on Milton Street, a grand 19th-century pillared building that the congregation has owned since 1943, half a dozen historians have visited over the past few months to scrutinize old tiles along the back wall of a fireplace in the parlor. It was not until this year that anyone recognized their historical significance. Two white porcelain plaques depict a pair of gentlemen wearing waistcoats, a model of a primitive paddle-wheel boat and a snub-nosed object that resembles a miniature submarine or perhaps a torpedo. The bas-relief porcelain is detailed down to fingernails, hair strands, buttonholes and boot tassels — even the upholstery tacks on one man’s chair are visible. “Of course I’d seen many, many fireplace tiles over the years, but never anything like this,” said Andrew S. Dolkart, director of the historic preservation program at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University. Mr. Dolkart said he stumbled on the parlor and the tiled fireplace by accident. He had gone to the Greenpoint church while researching sites for walking tours he conducts for the American Guild of Organists, and happened to take a close look at the parlor fireplace. “I realized these pieces were important and rare, and out of my field of expertise,” Mr. Dolkart said. So he started assembling a team, which has included Susan Tunick, president of the Friends of Terra Cotta, a preservation group in New York, and Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen, the lead curator of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. What they have determined about the porcelain scenes is that the nattily dressed standing figure is Robert Fulton, who pioneered designs for paddle-wheel steamboats, submarines and torpedoes in the early 1800s. The seated gentleman is the politician Robert Livingston, Fulton’s business partner. The plaques were probably made in the late 1870s at the Union Porcelain Works, a factory in Greenpoint that was in operation from the 1860s to the 1920s, Ms. Frelinghuysen said. The factory’s owner, a major real-estate developer named Thomas C. Smith, built and lived in the bay-fronted building that now houses the Greenpoint church. In the 1940s, the congregation converted some central rooms into a sanctuary with stained glass and an organ, but much of Smith’s décor was left intact, including honey-colored carved woodwork and elaborate plaster moldings. Union Porcelain Works was known for producing some zealously realistic images of historic figures. But Ms. Frelinghuysen said she had never seen a Fulton portrait made by the company. Did Smith commission the scenes? Who installed them in the Greenpoint fireplace alongside tiny 1890s tiles patterned in blue and white griffins and flowers, and why? “Was there just some bin of extra stuff at the factory that these were all pulled from at some point, or was there some actual connection between Smith and Fulton?” asked Ms. Frelinghuysen, who has gamely crawled around the sooty fireplace with a flashlight and magnifying glass. “It’s really wonderful how well preserved these are, as a puzzle for us to explore.” The leaders of the church, Pastor Ann Kansfield and the Rev. Jennifer Aull, find the academics’ enthusiasm somewhat perplexing. “I feel like such a philistine — why is everyone so excited about these?” Ms. Kansfield said. “But I do wonder why they were made, and how they ended up here. I hope someone figures it out.”",

She was 76. Her death was confirmed by Orlando Rey Santos, director of the environment directorate at Cuba’s Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment. Dr. Ibarra was born on Dec. 27, 1932, in Santiago de Cuba. She joined the faculty of the University of Havana in 1964 and eventually rose to become dean of biology. After early research on plankton and related marine organisms, she turned her attention to crocodiles, manatees and especially the turtles of the Caribbean, and to measures to protect them. “She was the quintessential scientist-activist,” said Oliver Houck, a professor at Tulane University Law School who went to Cuba in the 1990s to help draft environmental legislation. “She did not back down.” The World Wildlife Fund describes Cuba’s marine habitats as well preserved, in what it calls “dramatic contrast” to its Caribbean neighbors. Researchers who study its marine ecology attribute its relative health at least in part to Dr. Ibarra. Working at the marine center with very limited resources, Dr. Ibarra and her colleagues “created a hell of an agency out of nothing,” Professor Houck said.",

    "source": "Tiger Woods Seems Doubtful for British Open <eos> NEWTOWN SQUARE, Pa. — Tiger Woods did not rule out playing in the British Open. But the bulk of his remarks Tuesday indicated that his ailing left knee and left Achilles’ tendon would not be healed in time for him to make the tournament, the season’s third major championship, at Royal St. George’s in two weeks. Woods, who is here at the AT&T National this week in his role as the nonplaying tournament host, said that other than some putts, he had not hit any golf balls since he withdrew from the Players Championship after nine holes almost seven weeks ago. He said he exacerbated the strains to his left lateral collateral ligament and Achilles’, which he originally injured at the Masters in April. “Probably in retrospect, it was a borderline call whether I should have played the Players,” Woods said. He added: “I pushed it too hard and hurt myself. Now this time around, it’s different. I’m setting no timetable.” By not making a call on whether he will be ready for the British Open, he leaves open the possibility that he could play if he improves drastically in the next two weeks. But based on previous training regimens he has used when preparing to return to competition after an injury, the chances of a return appear virtually nil. Relaxed, joking at times and wearing an almost full beard, Woods looked as if he has been on summer vacation. That is hardly the case, he said. “We’re in the gym every day, most of the time two times, sometimes three times a day,” he said. “It’s not just the leg; it’s the whole body. Got to keep everything going. And obviously soft tissue, getting that worked on. So it’s been arduous, but then again, I’ve done this before.” Woods said surgery had not been discussed and was not required. And he dismissed the notion that his pursuit of Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 major championship victories — which Nicklaus capped by winning the 1986 Masters — had been set back by missing the recent United States Open and, possibly, the British Open. “Absolutely not,” said Woods, 35. “He won when he was 46, right? I’ve still got some time. And on top of that, we’re about the same pace, I believe, years on tour and majors won. So I feel pretty confident of what my future holds and very excited about it. “I’m excited about coming out here and being ready to go instead of trying to kind of patch it, which I’ve been for a while.”",

    "source": "New York City Police Reorganizing to Focus More on Gangs <eos> The New York Police Department announced on Tuesday that it was reorganizing its investigative operations, a move that senior officials said would allow for an increased focus on gang activity. Under the new structure, nearly all of the department’s investigative units will be brought under the supervision of the Detective Bureau, James P. O’Neill, chief of department, said. An investigative chief will be assigned to each of the department’s eight patrol borough commands and will report directly to the chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, Chief O’Neill said. The changes, which are to take effect next month, are the latest in a series of moves by the department as it tries to adapt its crime-fighting methods to new technology and trends. Under the plan announced on Tuesday, the Organized Crime Control Bureau will be eliminated, and its chief, Thomas P. Purtell, will be assigned a broader role as chief of a citywide operations bureau. In that role, he will oversee units conducting a range of tasks, from special operations to homeless outreach. The new strategy resurrects a style of policing that was employed in New York City decades ago and is now being revived by Commissioner William J. Bratton. The recent initiative began as a pilot program in Queens that was meant to increase efficiency by giving local commanders direct access to resources in the department’s specialized units, including detectives and officers assigned to divisions focused on gangs, guns and drugs. “It’s going to improve the coordination and focus of our investigations,” Chief O’Neill said. “So it will help us more quickly identify targets and patterns.” The Internal Affairs Bureau, which investigates allegations of police misconduct, and the Intelligence Division and Counterterrorism Bureau are not part of the reorganization. Chief Boyce said officials hoped to further drive down crime by targeting gangs and crews, whose members were responsible for more than half of the nonfatal shootings in the city last year. Chief O’Neill said: “It’s just an evolution of the way we do business. I think it’s important that if we’re going to keep pushing homicides and shootings down, we have to keep up with the trends, and this is where the trends are leading us.”",

    "source": "Hole in Fuselage Forces Qantas 747 to Land <eos> The Australian authorities opened an investigation on Friday into what caused a section of the fuselage of a Qantas airliner to burst open en route from Hong Kong to Melbourne , Australia , forcing the Boeing 747-400 to make an emergency landing in Manila . The jumbo jet, which carried 346 passengers and 19 crew members, landed safely on Friday and those on board left without injury. As a piece of fuselage the size of a sedan ripped from the plane, the jet, Qantas Flight 30, had been forced to descend steeply to 10,000 feet from 29,000 feet. Passengers described hearing a loud bang and seeing debris fly into the cabin. As the plane depressurized, oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling and cabin crew members shouted to passengers to put them on. “There was a terrific boom and bits of wood and debris just flew forward” into the first-class area, a passenger, Dr. June Kane, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from Manila, the capital of the Philippines . Another passenger, Phill Restall, of Chippenham, England , said that he was awakened by the sound of what the authorities said may have been an explosive decompression, but that there was no panic. “It dawned on a lot of people that this was a major incident,” he told the British Broadcasting Corporation. “There was no screaming. It wasn’t your typical television movie.” He said some passengers were shaking afterward, while, according to The Associated Press, others vomited. Aviation experts said the hole might have appeared when a part of the plane meant to reduce wind resistance pulled away from the fuselage, although they cautioned it was too soon to draw conclusions. Boeing and the National Transportation Safety Board of the United States said Friday that they were sending teams to aid in an investigation by the Australian Air Transport Safety Bureau. Under international treaty, the United States, as the country where the plane was built, will be an official participant in the investigation. The plane had recently undergone a major overhaul, in which engineers discovered a great deal of corrosion inside the cargo hold, The Daily Telegraph of Australia reported in its Saturday issue. As the plane lost pressure, oxygen masks descended from the ceiling, and passengers reported seeing mist and debris in the cabin. Video, apparently taken on a passenger’s cellphone and released by Reuters , showed passengers sitting calmly, wearing their yellow masks and watching the seat-back screens showing the plane’s altitude as the aircraft descended. “Nobody had any idea what was going on,” George Kierans, of Drogheda, Ireland , told the BBC. “I think most people were in a state of shock.” Many of those on board only realized how serious the situation was after they got off. Photographs and video of the plane, which went into service in 1991, showed a gaping hole in the underside of the aircraft, just in front of its right wing. In Washington , a senior counterterrorism official said there was no indication of terrorism in the incident. The accident was a blemish for Qantas, which has one of the world’s best safety records and prides itself on never having lost a jet in a major crash. Qantas gave no information on the probable cause of the accident but praised crew members for their calm handling of the emergency. The hole appeared to encompass a part of the plane called a fairing, which is meant to smooth out the surface of the fuselage and reduce wind drag. Many airplanes are subject to cracking as they age as a result of the repeated stress of pressurization and depressurization, but a 747 typically flies for many hours between landings and has far fewer pressurization cycles. Although metal fatigue has been blamed for similar emergencies in the past, fairings, which are installed on various parts of an aircraft, do not normally have that problem, said Robert W. Mann Jr., an industry consultant based in Port Washington, N.Y. That raised the question of whether the aircraft might have been damaged on the ground or from inside the cargo compartment, possibly when bags were being loaded, Mr. Mann said. He said passengers were not in danger from the depressurization because aircraft that fly above 10,000 feet are generally required to carry oxygen systems. The atmosphere is thin above that altitude, and people can function for only a few minutes without oxygen before becoming groggy and losing consciousness. Pilots are trained to bring a plane down swiftly to 10,000 feet, where passengers and crew can breathe without assistance. Given that the Qantas jet was at 29,000 feet, the plane dropped roughly a mile a minute, “not the kind of descent you would normally subject passengers to,” Mr. Mann said. The landing in Manila came only about 630 miles into the journey, a little over an hour after the plane took off. Qantas has decades of experience flying the Boeing 747, a model it first ordered in the 1960s. It has more than 50 of the planes in its fleet, although it was also one of the first customers for the rival Airbus A380 jumbo jet. At one point in the 1980s, Qantas’s entire jet fleet was made up of 747s, which are ideal for the long-haul flights in which the airline specializes. Qantas has promoted its safety record, and in the 1988 movie “Rain Man,” the autistic savant Raymond Babbitt, played by Dustin Hoffman , declared he would feel safe flying on Qantas because its planes “never crashed.” However, the airline suffered fatalities in its early years in business, when it flew propeller planes and flying boats, which take off and land on water. Qantas has also had some close calls. In 1999, a Qantas jet ran off a runway in Bangkok while landing in heavy rain. There were no reports of serious injuries. More recently, a Qantas-operated Boeing 717 was damaged in February when it sustained a hard landing at Darwin, Australia. The landing gear, tires and fuselage of the plane, flown by QantasLink, the airline’s regional carrier, were damaged. In 1988, a gash opened in a Boeing 737 belonging to Aloha Airlines at 24,000 feet on a flight from Hilo to Honolulu , Hawaii . A chunk of the plane’s roof and the cockpit door were blown out. One flight attendant was killed when she was swept out of the plane, and 65 passengers and crew members were hurt. Federal investigators said the accident was caused by metal fatigue, exacerbated by corrosion caused by salt water.",

    "source": "California Sues State Street Bank for Fraud <eos> The California attorney general’s office has charged the State Street Corporation with fraud, accusing the company of cheating the state’s two largest pension funds of at least $56.6 million by overcharging them for a series of foreign exchange trades. The lawsuit , unsealed on Tuesday by a Sacramento Superior Court judge, contends that State Street currency traders consistently overcharged the two state pension funds, Calpers and Calstrs, for the costs of managing their accounts since 2001, and then concealed the charges. The California attorney general is seeking to recover $200 million in overcharges and penalties. “State Street bankers committed unconscionable fraud by misappropriating millions of dollars that rightfully belonged to California’s public pension funds,” said Jerry Brown, the California attorney general. “This is just the latest example of how clever financial traders violate laws and rip off the public trust.” Carolyn Cichon, a spokeswoman for State Street, which is based in Boston, said the bank categorically denied any allegations of wrongdoing and would defend itself against any litigation. The lawsuit is the latest in a string of recent legal headaches for State Street, a bank that has long flown under the radar of ordinary investors but plays a crucial role in the global financial system in booking trades, lending securities and providing other services to hedge funds, pension funds and investment firms. Federal regulators considered it one of 19 too-big-to-fail banks in the recent stress tests . State Street has faced multiple regulatory investigations and shareholder lawsuits over whether it misled investors about the risk in certain bond fund, derivatives , and subprime mortgage-related investments. One lawsuit was filed in April on behalf of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It also comes as State Street is struggling to regain its financial footing. After passing the stress tests this spring, federal officials put them alongside JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and eight other large banks that were among the first to repay their taxpayer investments. State Street announced on Tuesday a $516 million profit in the third quarter, but its shares fell 8.4 percent, its biggest drop in five months, on the news of the lawsuit and a sobering earnings forecast. Ronald E. Logue, State Street’s chief executive, said the bank expected earnings to decrease by about 16 percent, worse than the 12 percent decline projected earlier this year. Bank of New York Mellon, another big custodial bank, reported a $2.46 billion third-quarter loss on Tuesday, but its shares rose 6.1 percent. Still, the lawsuit raises troubling questions about the bank’s practices and controls. It grew out of an inquiry by California state investigators who were looking into claims made against State Street by unidentified whistle-blowers that accused the bank of adding a secret and substantial markup to the price of their currency trades. The whistleblowers alleged that the scheme cost State Street clients about $400 million annually and dated back to 1998. According to the California Attorney General, State Street executed about $35.2 billion in currency trades for Calpers, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, and Calstrs, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, from 2001 to this fall. State Street tellingly referred to the state pension funds as “dumb” clients since they allowed the bank to handle foreign exchange transactions for them, according to a complaint filed by the whistleblowers. Smart clients, it said, traded directly with the bank and obtained better rates. The lawsuit contends that State Street concealed fraudulent pricing practices by entering false exchange rates into electronic trading databases and reporting false prices in the account statements that it provided Calpers and Calstrs. The lawsuit also accuses State Street of deliberately failing to include time stamp data in its reports so that the pension funds could not verify the actual cost of the trade. If the California attorney general is successful, the whistle-blowers who filed the original sealed lawsuit could receive a share of any money recovered.",

    "source": "Al Qaeda Fighters Try to Seize Yemeni Military Base in Aden <eos> MAHRA, Yemen — Dozens of fighters belonging to Al Qaeda ’s Yemeni affiliate briefly tried to seize control of a military base and the presidential palace in the port city of Aden before suddenly withdrawing on Sunday, according to local fighters and a senior military official in the city. By Sunday afternoon, there were no signs of Qaeda militants in Tawahi, the neighborhood surrounding the palace. But their appearance, however fleeting, was an embarrassing setback for the exiled government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which had described its success in securing Aden as a major victory in its war with the Houthi rebels. The government, which is backed by Saudi Arabia , was driven from power this year as the Houthis, a northern group, captured territory across Yemen, including parts of Aden in the south. A Saudi-led military coalition began an air offensive against the Houthis in March to restore Mr. Hadi. Al Qaeda’s Yemeni branch, which fiercely opposes the Houthis, has been able to capitalize on the disorder by seizing territory, including Mukalla, the country’s fifth largest city. At the same time, the militants have faced no opposition from the Saudi-led coalition as warplanes have carried out thousands of airstrikes against the Houthis and their allies. Officials in Mr. Hadi’s government have been reluctant to admit that small numbers of Qaeda militants have been fighting as part of a broad anti-Houthi coalition that includes southern separatists, Yemeni soldiers trained in the Persian Gulf as well as troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. On Saturday, local officials denied that Al Qaeda was present in Tawahi — even as local news accounts said that the militants had raised their black flag in the area and were telling residents that they controlled the neighborhood. On Sunday, a senior military official aligned with the anti-Houthi forces acknowledged the entrance of about 100 Qaeda fighters into Tawahi and said they had been the subject of a local security committee meeting. The official requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists. It was unclear whether the Qaeda fighters left because of an agreement with local commanders, or because they were trying to avoid an armed confrontation. On Sunday, local southern separatists took total control of Tawahi, said Abdul Wahab Al-Boujah, a local fighter who was guarding a checkpoint there.",

    "source": "Power Rising, Taliban Besiege Pakistani Shiites <eos> PESHAWAR, Pakistan — It was once known as the Parrot’s Beak, a strategic jut of Pakistan that the American-backed mujahedeen used to carry out raids on the Russians just over the border into Afghanistan . That was during the cold war. Now the area, around the town of Parachinar, is near the center of the new kind of struggle. The Taliban have inflamed and exploited a long-running sectarian conflict that has left the town under siege. The Taliban, which have solidified control across Pakistan’s tribal zone and are seeking new staging grounds to attack American soldiers in Afghanistan, have sided with fellow Sunni Muslims against an enclave of Shiites settled in Parachinar for centuries. The population of about 55,000 is short of food. The fruit crop is rotting, residents say, and the cost of a 66-pound bag of flour has skyrocketed to $100. And, in a mini-conflict that yet again demonstrates the growing influence of the Taliban and the Pakistan government’s lack of control over this highly sensitive border area, young and old, wounded and able-bodied, have become refugees in their own land. Thousands of displaced Shiites from Parachinar are scattered among relatives in Peshawar, capital of North-West Frontier Province, which abuts the tribal areas, and in hotels and shelters where images of Iranian religious leaders decorate the halls. Last month, a Pakistani government relief convoy loaded with food and medicines that had been sent to break the siege was attacked by the Taliban at the village of Pir Qayyum. Many of the 22 vehicles were burned and 12 drivers were killed by the Taliban, according to government officials here and Shiites. And little seems to be hindering the Taliban since the army, six months ago, agreed to a peace deal with the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, and has remained in its barracks. Groups of Taliban affiliated with Mr. Mehsud, who according to the Bush administration is supported by Al Qaeda, now control wide swaths of the tribal areas, from Waziristan in the south to Bajur in the north. From some parts of the tribal areas, like Waziristan and Mohmand, the Taliban have stepped up their operations into Afghanistan against NATO and American soldiers, cross-border attacks that have resulted in rising casualties for coalition forces over the last two months, the Bush administration said. In Kurram, the general area where Parachinar is located, the Taliban are a relatively new phenomenon, exploiting the generations-old sectarian conflict as a way of keeping the government out of the strategically important piece of territory, the senior government official in Kurram, Azam Khan, who serves as the political agent and who organized the June convoy, said in an interview. But Shiites say the Taliban are doing more than just keeping the government at bay. The Shiites say that because they are stopping the militants from entering Afghanistan, the Taliban are attacking them. The situation has attracted the attention of the leading Shiite figure of Iraq, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who has encouraged all Shiites in Pakistan to do what they can to help their brethren in Parachinar, said Sheik Mohammed Shifah Alnajafi, the deputy representative of Ayatollah Sistani in Pakistan, and the vice principal of a Shiite seminary in the capital, Islamabad. About 80 percent of Pakistan’s overwhelmingly Muslim population is Sunni, and about 20 percent Shiite. In Kurram as a whole, the two sects are almost evenly divided, with Parachinar almost entirely Shiite, according to figures from the secretariat of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, the body that loosely oversees the tribal region. The origins of the siege reach back to April 2007, when sectarian violence between Shiites and Sunnis flared over provocative remarks made by a Sunni of Wahhabi beliefs against historical Shiite figures, said Muhammad Amin Shaheedi, the director of the Islamic Research Council in Islamabad, and a leader of the Shiite community in Pakistan. But unlike previous bouts of sectarian violence that were settled by mediation after a few days, the tensions mounted, exacerbated by the Taliban, who sided with some of the Sunni, he said. Then, last Nov. 16, the tensions exploded in a day of extraordinary violence in Parachinar and surrounding villages, including mortar fire between Sunni mosques and Shiite mosques, said M. B. Bangash, a Shiite businessman from Parachinar who has taken refuge in Peshawar. In contrast to other parts of the tribal areas, the Pakistani Army has had a garrison in Parachinar for decades, but it failed to stop the violence, he said. “The government is indifferent,” Mr. Bangash said. Some of the moderate Sunni families in Parachinar, who had often helped Shiites in conflicts, were attacked in the November fighting by extremist Shiites and were forced to flee, according to Mr. Khan, a well-regarded political agent who was appointed last month to the area in an effort by the government to reduce tensions. This left the general Shiite population feeling more vulnerable to the Taliban, he said. But the ambush of the convoy last month proved the power of the Taliban, the displaced Shiites in Peshawar said. A driver of one of the trucks who survived, Asif Hussain, described being captured at Pir Qayyum, taken to a Taliban training camp in the village of Shasho, interrogated and then released after convincing his captors that he was not Shiite, but Sunni. “At the camp, the Taliban killed eight other drivers because they were Shia,” said Mr. Hussain, 33, in a telephone interview from Parachinar. An official of the Pakistan Peoples Party from Parachinar, Mirza Jihadi, confirmed the existence of the Shasho camp, which, he said, is at a place where Afghan refugees used to live and is now controlled by loyalists of Mr. Mehsud, the head of the Pakistani Taliban. The displaced in Peshawar told stories of growing hardship at home, and they complained bitterly of the failure of the government to help. “I want to go home but the government does not provide any transportation,” said Mohib Ali, 45, at a hotel here, as he nursed a bandaged right arm that was wounded, he said, in fighting. He had spent the previous day at the Peshawar airport hoping to board a military helicopter that he had been told would take civilians back to Parachinar. But instead, he said, it filled up with soldiers returning after leave, and a few favored others with good contacts. The army garrison in the town had done little to help, and had failed to organize major food supplies, said Haji Gulab Hussain, a retired government official who leads a Shiite tribal council. “The lower-ranking soldiers are ready for any action,” he said. “But the army is supporting the Taliban. There are no orders.” During the November violence, he said, “The army did nothing.” Parachinar has prided itself on the best education in the tribal areas since the British colonial era, so the closing of schools since the violence began is a special blow, some of the displaced said. Teachers were too afraid to travel, they said. The one hospital in Parachinar was left with only a few nurses. Basic medicines, including anesthesia equipment and oxygen, were depleted, according to a medic reached by telephone. Killings have demoralized the population. In the village of Bilyamin, 22 miles south of Parachinar, two students walking to their matriculation exams were shot dead by the Taliban, Mr. Bangash said. Some solace was coming from Afghanistan, the refugees said. A schoolboy, Ashfaq Hussain, 12, arrived in Peshawar on Tuesday after a two-day journey by car through Afghanistan to enroll at Islamia Collegiate School, a prestigious school here. “We can go through Afghanistan without a visa, it’s a help,” said his father, Sabir Hussain. But his son’s travel to Peshawar by car via Afghanistan cost the equivalent of $50 over two days, instead of the usual $3 by bus in about five hours, he said. Much of the vegetable crop of potatoes and tomatoes that is normally sold to markets in the heart of Pakistan was now being sent to Kabul, Mr. Bangash said. More perishable fruits were wasted. After the disaster of the June convoy, Mr. Khan, the political agent, said he had a new plan to try to persuade moderate tribesmen, both Sunni and Shiite, who were now weary of the violence, to allow the opening of the 45-mile road that runs from the town of Thal along a deep, wide valley up to Parachinar. “It’s been an intense year of warfare,” he said. “Both sides are fed up.” In Islamabad, Mr. Jihadi said the Interior Ministry had promised on Wednesday to resume flights by the government airline, Pakistan International Airways, to the airstrip in Parachinar, which had been abandoned long ago. To try to quash the Taliban, the ministry would urge the local tribes to form small armies, known as lashkar, he said. The ministry was also offering local people financial rewards, he said, if they killed a Taliban leader. But whether the army would take a role in the efforts to find a solution appeared to remain an open question.",

    "source": "Pirates Beat Tigers as Justin Verlander Is Shelled <eos> Justin Verlander has never been a big fan of April. That is why it was surprising when he took a no-hitter into the sixth inning of his season-opening start last week in Miami. On Monday, though, things got back to normal. Gregory Polanco had two of Pittsburgh’s six doubles, and the Pirates chased Verlander in the fifth inning on the way to a 7-4 win over the host Detroit Tigers. Verlander (0-1) allowed seven runs and 10 hits — five of them doubles — in four and a third innings. Jon Niese (1-0) gave up four runs — three earned — and five hits in six innings. Mark Melancon pitched a one-hit ninth for his third save. ORIOLES 9, RED SOX 7 Chris Davis hit a tiebreaking, three-run homer off the new Boston closer Craig Kimbrel in the ninth inning and drove in five runs, carrying Baltimore over the Red Sox in David Ortiz’s final home opener. Kimbrel (0-1), the All-Star reliever acquired in an off-season trade from San Diego, entered with the score tied at 6-6. He walked Caleb Joseph with one out and Manny Machado with two outs, then gave up Davis’s home run to center. PADRES 4, PHILLIES 3 Alexi Amarista’s safety squeeze in the seventh scored the go-ahead run as San Diego spoiled Philadelphia’s home opener. Kevin Quackenbush (1-0) struck out the only batter he faced to earn the win after starter Andrew Cashner allowed three runs in five-plus innings. CARDINALS 10, BREWERS 1 Michael Wacha allowed four hits in six scoreless innings, and St. Louis had 10 extra-base hits while routing Milwaukee in the Cardinals’ home opener. Jeremy Hazelbaker was 4 for 4 with a triple, double and sacrifice fly, lifting his average to .526, and his fellow rookie Aledmys Diaz had two doubles. WHITE SOX 4, TWINS 1 Austin Jackson hit a two-run, two-out single in the fourth inning, one pitch after just missing a grand slam, and Minnesota dropped to 0-7 with a loss in its home opener. Jose Quintana (1-0) completed six smooth innings with one run allowed for the White Sox, who have won five of their first seven. NATIONALS 6, BRAVES 4 Falling to 0-6 for the first time in nearly 30 years, Atlanta lost to host Washington, which overcame a shaky start by Max Scherzer. The Nationals’ Wilson Ramos helped out with four singles and two R.B.I. Scherzer (1-0), who went six innings, won despite allowing two-run doubles to A. J. Pierzynski and Nick Markakis in the first two innings.",

    "source": "Macy’s Will Cut 10,000 Jobs After Poor Holiday Sales <eos> Struggling with sagging sales over another crucial holiday shopping season, Macy’s announced on Wednesday that it was eliminating more than 10,000 jobs as part of a continuing plan to cut costs and close 100 stores. Macy’s, the country’s largest department store chain, said sales at its stores had fallen 2.1 percent in November and December compared with the same period in 2015. Terry J. Lundgren, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that while the trend was “consistent with the lower end of our guidance, we had anticipated sales would be stronger.” He attributed the decline to “broader challenges” facing much of the retail industry. Consumers, who endured a long recession, have turned to low-cost chains like T. J. Maxx and shifted their spending away from brick-and-mortar stores for the convenience of online shopping with the retail giant Amazon. The announcement on Wednesday continued a trend for Macy’s, which announced last January that it was eliminating about 4,500 jobs in a major restructuring. Then, too, it said slumping holiday season sales had hurt its bottom line. The company, which now has 730 stores, announced in August that it would close 100 of them. On Wednesday, it identified 68 stores to be closed. The 158,000-square-foot store in the Douglaston neighborhood of Queens, which opened in 1981, will close. Stores at the Marketplace Mall in Rochester; at the Oakdale Mall in Johnson City, N.Y., near Binghamton; and at the Preakness Shopping Center in Wayne, N.J., will close, the company said. Of the 68, three were closed by the middle of 2016, 63 will close in the spring and two will be closed by the middle of 2017. Three other locations were sold or are to be sold. The company said it planned to close about 30 other stores over the next few years. Some employees may be offered positions at nearby stores, but Macy’s estimated that 3,900 workers would be affected by the closings. It also said it planned to restructure parts of its business, leading to a reduction of an additional 6,200 jobs. Over all, the job cuts represent about 7 percent of its work force. The company estimated that the changes would save about $550 million a year, starting in 2017. Mr. Lundgren said the company was closing stores that were “unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations because of changes in the local retail shopping landscape.” Other sites were being targeted for closing to take advantage of their highly valued real estate. The company, which owns the Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s brands, has been struggling with declining traffic in its stores, where the bulk of its business is still conducted. It plans to invest some of its savings in expanding its digital business. Macy’s said it now expected to earn $2.95 to $3.10 per share on an adjusted basis for its 2016 fiscal year, compared with its prior forecast of $3.15 to $3.40 per share. Shares in Macy’s fell nearly 10 percent to $32.30 in after-hours trading on Wednesday.",

    "source": "Sanchez Is the Starter for the Jets, Until He Isn’t <eos> FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Mark Sanchez , who seems to be everyone’s favorite target, took a spot in front of his locker, as he usually does on Wednesdays. He did not look, or sound, like a guy who was having a bad day, or month. “Start winning, and we’ll be all right,” he said with his customary cheerfulness. Sanchez had taken subtle public hits within hours from not only Woody Johnson, the Jets ’ owner, but also his coach and staunchest defender, Rex Ryan , who had made a lukewarm pronouncement: Sanchez is the team’s starter. This week. Barring injury. “And things happen,” Ryan said. Ryan did not elaborate on what that meant. But with the Jets at 2-3 and Sanchez not completing half his passes, Ryan was much less enthusiastic about Sanchez’s future than he was last Nov. 18, after a loss to the Denver Broncos (and Tim Tebow ). That day, Ryan said of Sanchez, “He’s going to be our quarterback for as long as I’m here, which I hope is a long, long time.” Ryan sounded a lot less sure about that Wednesday. His news conference started as it usually does, with an overview of the next opponent, the Indianapolis Colts, but then evolved into a discussion over semantics. At one point, a reporter pointed out to Ryan that if he did not want to make a similar pronouncement to last year’s, he would have to answer questions every week about Sanchez’s status. “I got no problems answering questions each week,” Ryan said. “You guys know me.” Another reporter said, “But you’ve gone from saying, ‘he’s our starter,’ to, ‘he’s our starter this week,’ ’ “He’s our starter. What do you want me to say?” Ryan said. “If he’s our starter this week, he’s our starter. You can go Answer A and Answer B and come up with C, I guess.” On Tuesday, the day after the Jets lost to the Houston Texans, Ryan said there was no question that Sanchez was the starter. But that was a day before Johnson said in an interview with CNBC that he wanted to keep Tebow on the team through the 2014 season, when his contract expires. Johnson, who appeared on the cable channel to talk primarily about Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, said of Tebow, “I think he’s going to be a real valuable asset in terms of helping us win games.” Johnson was also supportive of Sanchez, saying that he also had the ability to help the Jets win games. But when asked if that meant Sanchez would never be benched, Johnson replied, “Never is a long, long time period.” But there was some good news. Nick Mangold, the all-pro center who injured his right ankle in the third quarter of Monday’s loss, said he was “hopeful” — “I’m always hopeful,” he said — that he would be able to play Sunday. Dustin Keller, the tight end who has been Sanchez’s favorite receiver, is expected to return Sunday after missing the last four games with a hamstring injury. Stephen Hill, the rookie wide receiver, is also expected to return from a similar injury. Keller said of Sanchez, “Just because of the time Mark and I have spent together, we kind of have that communication that makes it so much easier.” Sanchez also did not seem bothered by answering a lot of questions about Ryan’s tepid endorsement. Sanchez said of Ryan, “He has faith in me,” and he added that he was not worried about losing his starting position. “I’m really not,” he said. He has ways to block out the criticism. “Stick around the building, put blinders on, put earplugs in and keep playing,” he said. There are more than sports channels to watch on television. “There’s a power button,” he added. Sanchez left the locker room, and shortly before it was closed to reporters, Tebow stepped in front of his locker and was surrounded by reporters. He said it meant a lot that Johnson had given him such a strong public endorsement. “I’m definitely someone who gets frustrated,” Tebow said, “but I know my role here right now.” But then, just a few minutes later, he said, “You never know what’s going to happen in the future.” EXTRA POINTS Matt Slauson, the Jets offensive lineman whose chop block Monday resulted in a season-ending knee injury to Houston linebacker Brian Cushing, said: “It’s unfortunate, but you know, it happens. I wasn’t trying to hurt him, obviously. I must have caught him by surprise. Things like that happen.”",

    "source": "A Westchester School for Those Who Want to Train in the Circus Arts <eos> Jenna Kavalchuk is a cardiac sonographer with the VA Hudson Valley Health Care System in Castle Point. She is also a daredevil, whose aerial feats inspire strangers to stop and shoot videos of her on their iPhones. They did so at the September installment of downtown Tarrytown’s Third Friday Street Fair , where Ms. Kavalchuk, dressed in a purple leotard and black tights, hung upside-down from a sky-high rig hung with yards of purple silk. To the rhythms of Rose McGowan’s version of “You Belong to Me,” Ms. Kavalchuk glided, aloft, through a series of gymnastic tumbles. When she dismounted onto a small black mat on the Washington Street asphalt, she was met with applause and wolf whistles. It was her first time performing an aerial show. “I was actually very nervous before I got up there,” said Ms. Kavulchuk, 28, of Suffern, after her two-minute routine for an audience of about 100, made up mostly of families with young children. “But I think I did really well. I concentrated and I didn’t make any mistakes, like getting caught in the fabric. By the time I got up there, I wasn’t nervous at all. It felt great.” Her sense of triumph, she said, was made possible by Westchester Circus Arts , a 2-year-old Tarrytown school offering instruction on everything found under the classic big top, from tightrope walking to the trapeze. Ms. Kavalchuk got the idea to try aerial performing after watching traditional burlesque shows in Manhattan. She has been taking aerial performing classes since March. “I love it. I’ve gotten very fit very quickly,” she said. Westchester Circus Arts, operating in the gymnasium at the Y Early Learning Center, part of the Family Y.M.C.A. at Tarrytown , was formed in 2012 by Hilary Sweeney, 33, of Nyack, a former ballerina. She started dancing at age 5 in her hometown, Oxford, Mass., but discovered while in a pre-professional training program with the Boston Ballet that her body was ill-suited for such a career. Image Mikayla Nolan is a performer from Westchester Circus Arts. Credit Richard Getler “Specifically, it was my hips. I was born with my hips turned in, and I had to have both my legs broken and reset at birth to get me to walk straight,” she said. “Ballet is an art form that requires perfect turnout. Even though I was yearning to do it professionally, I never really could.” Then, in her early 20s, she saw a Cirque du Soleil performance. “It was ballet in the air. For me, it was transformational,” she said. “In the circus, you didn’t have to fit a mold. You could make your own mold.” Ms. Sweeney did not run away and join the circus after that inspirational show. Instead, she graduated with a degree in neuroscience from Manhattanville College in Purchase in 2003, and went to work as a flavor chemist for PepsiCo in Valhalla. She developed her aerial skills through private training with professionals in Manhattan, Montreal and San Francisco and performed in shows such as Cirque Le Masque’s “Carnivale,” and an Off Broadway production of “Above the Belt.” In 2008 she began moonlighting as an aerial instructor at the Family Y.M.C.A. at Tarrytown. “I was doing so much teaching and aerial performing on the side that it sort of took over my life,” she said. “I made a decision to leave the cubicle, which I was very wary of doing because there are so many unknowns. And a job with Pepsi is like a golden handcuff. But it was the best decision I ever made.” The community’s response to the classes, which are geared to everyone from kindergartners hoping to master juggling to adults who want to learn aerial skills, has been enthusiastic. Image Ms. Nolan in Tarrytown on Sept. 19. Credit Richard Getler “This was my second year doing summer camps, and both years we were full,” with 40 campers, ages 5 to 18, per session, some traveling from as far away as Connecticut and Peekskill. “It hasn’t been a hard sell,” said Ms. Sweeney, who runs the school with a co-director, Carlo Pellegrini, also of Nyack. Mr. Pellegrini, 62, is a former ringmaster with the Big Apple Circus and the director and co-founder of Amazing Grace Circus , a nonprofit Tarrytown circus specializing in youth outreach. Both he and Ms. Sweeney teach at Westchester Circus Arts. Ms. Sweeney teaches aerial silks, which she said is the most popular class among adults. Mr. Pellegrini leads classes for children and teenagers, including “circus gym,” a program with clowning and acrobatics for children five to eight, and “variety arts,” including juggling, unicycle, stilts and other on-the-ground-tricks for children nine through 12. Four more instructors lead classes in trapeze, acrobatics and lyra , which involves a suspended spinning hoop used in aerial shows. Both Ms. Sweeney and Mr. Pellegrini offer private lessons; Ms. Sweeney in aerial arts and Mr. Pellegrini in juggling, clowning, vaudeville and human pyramid-making. Classes, though, are not the only way to experience Westchester Circus Arts. “Nevermore,” a circus-theater show created by Ms. Sweeney and based on Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven,” will have its premiere in Sleepy Hollow, in a tent on Horan’s Landing, Oct. 25 and 26. At the recent Tarrytown street festival, Mr. Pellegrini assembled and monitored the aerial rig, an A-shaped structure that looks like a swing set without the swings, while Ms. Sweeney played M.C. In addition to Ms. Kavalchuk, a handful of students from the school’s “teen troupe” performed routines using the silks and lyra. Image Carlo Pellegrini, a former ringmaster with the Big Apple Circus, teaches at Westchester Circus Arts. Credit Richard Getler Among them was Tess Weitzner, 19, of Sleepy Hollow, whose feats of acrobatic derring-do using the lengths of purple silk left Jenny Mirchandani wide-eyed. Jenny, a 7-year-old from Cortlandt Manor, watched from the sidewalk with her mother, Tina. “This is the coolest gymnastics I’ve ever seen,” Jenny said. “I mean ballet.” Her reaction was a familiar one to Ms. Weitzner, who has performed with Westchester Circus Arts at several Third Fridays events. “What I love about aerial is that it combines creativity with athleticism. It’s graceful, and to me it’s more creative than gymnastics,” she said. Since she was in seventh grade, Ms. Weitzner has been training with Ms. Sweeney, but her fascination with the circus dates to a circus summer camp she attended at Purchase College as a 7-year-old. “I’ve just always loved the idea of it,” she said. “And the circus is an incredibly tight-knit community. No one is hopeless in the circus. Even if you can’t do a split on the silks, you can still learn to juggle or learn a clown act.” Ms. Sweeney puts the allure of it in another way: “There’s a sense of doing the impossible that’s innate to the circus. A sense of amazement. Everybody wants that feeling, and we want to provide it.”",

Barnes & Noble, the largest American bookstore chain, said it had reduced the retail price of its Nook tablet with 16 gigabytes of memory to $199, from $249. The company also shaved $20 off its eight-gigabyte model, to $179. And Barnes & Noble lowered the price of its Nook Color by $20, to $149. The new prices went into effect on Sunday. The Nook has given the chain 27 percent of the American market for e-books, Barnes & Noble has said. Amazon is the market leader with about 60 percent of e-book and e-reader sales. Despite the popularity of the Nook devices, Barnes & Noble has had to cut prices a number of times to compete with Amazon. Earlier price reductions ate into Barnes & Noble’s earnings. The company, which has bet its future on e-books, reported lower-than-expected revenue in its fourth fiscal quarter and said Nook revenue fell 10.5 percent. Signs at one Barnes & Noble store in Manhattan already reflected the new prices on Sunday.",

    "source": "Ex-Racehorses Starve as Charity Fails in Mission to Care for Them <eos> One of the largest private organizations in the world dedicated to caring for former racehorses has been so slow or delinquent in paying for the upkeep of the more than 1,000 horses under its care that scores have wound up starved and neglected, some fatally, according to interviews and inspection reports. The group, the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation, is based in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., just miles from the famous racetrack that annually hosts one of thoroughbred racing’s premier meets. For years, it has received millions in donations from some pillars of the industry. But over the past two years, according to the foundation’s financial disclosure documents, it has been operating at a deficit, and as a result has not reliably been paying the 25 farms it contracts with to oversee the retired horses. For example, at the 4-H Farm in Oklahoma, inspectors last month could find only 47 of the 63 retired horses that had been assigned to it. Many of those were starving. The rest had died, probably of neglect, inspectors concluded. Last week, at a Kentucky farm that is also supposed to receive money from the foundation, 34 horses were found in “poor” or “emaciated” condition, inspectors found. One horse had to be euthanized because of malnutrition. It is unclear how many members of the foundation’s blue-chip board of trustees might have been aware of the deteriorating quality of care the horses were receiving. But the foundation’s biggest benefactor — the estate of the breeder and owner Paul Mellon — in recent years had become concerned about the growth of the foundation’s herd after hearing the complaints of caretakers, and it investigated. The estate, which in 2001 established a $5 million endowment for the foundation and subsequently contributed $2 million more, last December requested that Stacey Huntington, a veterinarian based in Springfield, Mo., evaluate the foundation’s herd. So far, Dr. Huntington, along with a local veterinarian in each location, has examined more than 700 horses at more than a dozen farms from Oklahoma to Kentucky and South Carolina. She found many examples of neglect and lack of support from the T.R.F. in her visits to the farms. “We have dug ourselves a big hole financially, and we’re still behind,” the foundation’s president, George Grayson, said. “It’s been a struggle to keep up with the costs associated with a large and aging horse population, at a time when the economy and giving is down. Everybody on the board takes any allegation seriously, and anything less than positive circumstances for the horses are unacceptable. When we’ve been made aware of issues, we have responded quickly, and we will on this.” The cases of neglect, while noteworthy because of the prominence of the organization overseeing the horses, are only the latest embarrassment for an industry that remains vexed by one of its most fundamental challenges: how to humanely look out for horses that no longer have any value at the racetrack or in the breeding shed. The Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation was founded in 1984 to save racehorses no longer able to compete on the racetrack “from possible neglect, abuse and slaughter,” its mission statement says. It has been embraced by some of the biggest forces in the sport: the Jockey Club has given the foundation nearly $250,000 over the past two years, and individual owners — like Mike Repole, the co-founder of Glaceau water and the owner of the current Kentucky Derby favorite, Uncle Mo — have given sizable contributions as well. Over the years, the foundation’s board has included some of the sport’s most influential owners, and the farms it contracts with have been homes to many of the horses those owners have bred and campaigned. Beam Us Up, an accomplished racehorse bred by Richard Santulli, the former chief executive of NetJets, was recently removed from one of the contract farms because of neglect. Santulli’s wife, Peggy, is on the T.R.F. board. The findings of the veterinarian hired by the Mellon estate, Dr. Huntington, moved the estate’s trustees to send the farms money for things as basic as food. She found that some 25 percent of the horses have required some kind of urgent care, which the Mellon estate has provided, costing it “tens of thousands” of dollars, said Ted Terry, one of its trustees. Dr. Huntington found that the foundation’s education of the caretakers and oversight of their farms had been poor. At one farm, Dr. Huntington said, the horses were being fed cattle feed that contained a toxic element. “The horses are getting the short end of the stick from this group that advertises itself as advocates of horses,” Dr. Huntington said. The most dramatic instance of neglect discovered so far, she said, was at the 4-H Farm in Okmulgee, Okla., where the owners, Alan and Janice Hudgins, would not let Dr. Huntington onto their property to inspect T.R.F. horses until the foundation gave them $20,000, a partial payment of what was owed them for taking care of 63 horses since 2005. They also forced the foundation to sign a pledge not to prosecute them for the condition of the horses. When the horses were released, the 47 survivors were in such poor condition that Dr. Huntington filed a report with the Okmulgee County sheriff’s office. Her report included photographs of the malnourished horses, three of them considered starving. Nearly all of them needed urgent care. Ms. Hudgins said her farm had kept horses for the foundation since 2005, but in recent years it fell into a pattern of falling behind in payments. In a tough economy with rising fuel and feed costs, Ms. Hudgins said her family got tired of having to settle for less than they were owed by the foundation. She said they had done the best they could with the horses, and had informed the T.R.F. that some older horses had died. The foundation ran a $1.2 million deficit in 2009, according to its most recent tax filings with the federal government, three times the total in its previous filing. Its inability to pay the agreed costs for the care of its horses severed a number of relationships with farms, including Claybank Farm in Lexington, Ky., which cared for up to 80 horses. Interviews with farm owners, as well as e-mail correspondence they provided, showed the foundation was aware of its deepening financial straits — occasionally taking horses from farms where they had been well cared for and placing them elsewhere on the cheap. Last September, the T.R.F. owed Out2Pasture Farms in Jamestown, Mo., more than $43,000, The farm, run by two University of Missouri professors, Zachary and Robin Hurst-March, is one of the nation’s most highly regarded sanctuaries for thoroughbreds. When the couple pressed for payment, the T.R.F. asked them to reduce their per diem to $3 a day and eventually removed 13 of their horses. “I was being emotionally blackmailed to lower my per diem, and was the subject of retribution because I questioned the care of the horses,” said Mrs. Hurst-Marsh, who is owed $10,000. When Gayle England, whose farm in Stroud, Okla., is also highly regarded as a special-care facility, complained not only of the chronic slow pay but the general lack of regard for the farms and the horses, 26 T.R.F. horses were taken from her. Last month, some of the horses in the worst shape were taken from other foundation farms and returned to the Hurst-Marsh farm and Ms. England. In fact, one of the 14 horses moved to England’s farm with the help and funding of the Mellon Estate had to be put down. “They were making their administrative payroll this whole time, but the horses they were suffering,” Ms. England said. “They need to be held accountable.” Mr. Terry, a Mellon estate trustee, said he still does not know what went wrong. “We don’t know if it was bad judgment, taking on too many horses or bad decisions made internally,” he said. “Eventually, we’re going to have to ask ourselves if we are throwing good money after bad.”",

    "source": "Tech Leaders and Obama Find Shared Problem: Fading Public Trust <eos> WASHINGTON — President Obama met with top technology industry executives on Tuesday to discuss two seemingly distinct controversies: a faulty health care website, and the digital surveillance practices of the National Security Agency. The meeting started with an announcement by Mr. Obama that he was reaching into the ranks of Microsoft, the software giant, to select Kurt DelBene as the next person to run HealthCare.gov. But the focus quickly turned from the health care site to the concerns of Apple, Microsoft, Google and other technology companies about the spying efforts, the latest illustration of the strained relationship between an industry and a White House that had long been close. For months, leading technology companies have been buffeted by revelations about government spying on their customers’ data, which they believe are undermining confidence in their services. The Obama administration has been blasted for the botched rollout of the health site, which prevented many people from signing up for health insurance in the first weeks of the site’s introduction, but seem to have been largely repaired since then. The meeting on Tuesday brought those two issues together into a common forum, and at least partly in the public eye. “Both sides are saying, ‘My biggest issue right now is trust,’ ” said Matthew Prince, co-founder and chief executive of CloudFlare, an Internet start-up. “If you’re on the White House side, the issue is they’re getting beaten up because they’re seen as technically incompetent. On the other side, the tech industry needs the White House right now to give a stern rebuke to the N.S.A. and put in real procedures to rein in a program that feels like it’s out of control.” The meeting of Mr. Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and 15 executives from the likes of Apple, Google, Facebook and Yahoo came a week after those companies and other giants, usually archrivals, united in a public campaign calling for reform in government surveillance practices. On Monday, a federal district judge ruled that the N.S.A. sweep of data from all Americans’ phone calls was unconstitutional , a ruling that added import to the discussions. “We appreciated the opportunity to share directly with the president our principles on government surveillance that we released last week and we urge him to move aggressively on reform,” the executives said in a statement afterward. The chief executives invited to the White House included Timothy D. Cook of Apple, Dick Costolo of Twitter, Marissa Mayer of Yahoo, Eric E. Schmidt of Google, Brian L. Roberts of Comcast, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Reed Hastings of Netflix. Also there were Bradford L. Smith, executive vice president and general counsel of Microsoft, and Erika Rottenberg, vice president and general counsel of LinkedIn. The exchange, which both the White House and attendees from the technology industry said was cordial, lasted about two hours, more than twice as long as scheduled. Image Kurt DelBene, a longtime Microsoft executive, was appointed Tuesday to run HealthCare.gov. Credit Paul Sakuma/Associated Press But even before the meeting, there were some differences about where the discussion would be headed, especially as the White House indicated that the top item on the agenda for discussion be improvements to HealthCare.gov. “From our perspective, this was all about the N.S.A.,” said one person from the tech industry briefed on the meeting who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about it. “We all want Healthcare.gov to succeed, but it is not key to our business.” But Mr. Obama was also there to name Mr. DelBene, a longtime Microsoft executive, as the new fix-it manager of Healthcare.gov. Mr. DelBene, who joined Microsoft in 1992, was president of the company’s lucrative Office division for nearly three years. Mr. DelBene announced his retirement from Microsoft earlier this year, and his last day at the company was Monday. He starts his new job Wednesday, succeeding the initial manager, Jeffrey D. Zients. In February, a month later than initially planned, Mr. Zients will shift to his previously announced job as Mr. Obama’s chief White House economic adviser, the director of the National Economic Council. Mr. DelBene will stay at least through the first half of 2014; his wife, Suzan DelBene, also was a Microsoft executive but was elected in 2012 to Congress as a Democrat representing the Washington State district where Microsoft has its headquarters. The discussion on Tuesday quickly turned to the controversy over the N.S.A.’s intelligence-gathering, which has mounted since leaks by the former agency contractor Edward J. Snowden began emerging last summer. More recent revelations that the N.S.A. is accessing data from Google and Yahoo services without their knowledge was also discussed, according to technology executives briefed on the meeting who asked not to be named. The technology companies raised some specific concerns about that the government’s spying efforts. Several executives, including Ms. Mayer, the chief executive of Yahoo, expressed concerned that foreign countries may now decide to prevent all the user data generated by users in a foreign country from flowing to the United States, the people said. One such law has been proposed in Brazil. The executives said these laws would significantly hurt their businesses and America’s start-up economy. The administration listened to executives’ concerns, but made no commitments, these people said. The one topic the administration seemed most sympathetic to was the web companies’ call for greater transparency around government surveillance requests, according to these people. It was the one issue nearly everyone in the room seemed most aligned on. The administration told executives that government action related to N.S.A. surveillance would happen in the new year, but there was no indication of what that meant and more precisely when it would occur. “This was an opportunity for the president to hear from C.E.O.’s directly,” the White House said in a statement about the meeting, adding, “The president made clear his belief in an open, free and innovative Internet and listened to the group’s concerns and recommendations, and made clear that we will consider their input as well as the input of other outside stakeholders as we finalize our review of signals intelligence programs.” The meeting reflected a shift in the tech sector’s once-close relationship with Mr. Obama, whose 2008 election many industry executives generously supported. After the troubled start of the health care site, the Obama administration tapped a small group of engineers, who took leave from various technology companies to help with the effort. That group included Michael Dickerson, a site reliability engineer at Google who had also worked on Mr. Obama’s campaign. “The government really needs the tech industry to achieve its policy goals,” said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School. “They tried on their own with the Washington version of tech and we saw what happened.”",

    "source": "Predators Send Rangers to Fourth Loss in Five Games <eos> James Neal scored twice, Mike Ribeiro had three assists and the Predators held off the Rangers, 5-3, in Nashville on Monday night. Filip Forsberg, Craig Smith and Ryan Ellis also scored for the Predators, who won for the third time in four games. Roman Josi added two assists, and Pekka Rinne had 26 saves. Jesper Fast, Rick Nash and J. T. Miller had goals for the Rangers, who lost for the fourth time in five games. Forsberg scored the first goal with 1 minute 4 seconds left in the first period. With Nashville on a power play, Josi sent a pass from the right boards to Forsberg on the left face-off dot, where he sent a one-timer by goaltender Henrik Lundqvist on the stick side. Fast tied the game at 6:59 of the second. Standing in the low slot, he deflected Dan Girardi’s shot from the right point between Rinne’s pads. Girardi returned to the Rangers’ lineup after missing five games with a small crack in his right kneecap. Nashville regained the lead at 13:48 of the second on Neal’s 14th of the season. From the high slot, he beat Lundqvist with a wrist shot that glanced off the left post. Smith gave Nashville a two-goal lead at 7:34 of the third when he tipped home Josi’s shot from the high slot. That goal came just 2:16 after Forsberg appeared to make it 3-1 at 5:18 with a shot from behind the Rangers’ net, but the goal was overturned when the Rangers challenged and it was ruled that Smith had interfered with Lundqvist. Ellis scored at 9:52 of the third on Nashville’s second power-play goal of the night. Neal scored his second of the game at 11:13. Lundqvist was relieved by Antti Raanta following Neal’s second goal. Lundqvist made 30 saves on 35 shots against. Nash scored an unassisted goal at 13:20, and Miller added a goal at 16:02. Rangers defenseman Kevin Klein, a former Predator, returned to the lineup after missing 11 games with an oblique injury. CAPITALS 2, SABRES 0 Braden Holtby made 31 saves, and Alex Ovechkin scored his 18th goal to lead visiting Washington over Buffalo for its eighth straight win. The Capitals, who lead the Eastern Conference, improved to 27-6-2, the best start in franchise history. Sabres forward Evander Kane played for the first time since The Buffalo News reported that the Buffalo police were investigating a sex-crime allegation against him. Kane spoke to reporters at a morning skate Monday for about 30 seconds, saying that he had done nothing wrong and was looking forward to having his name cleared. CANADIENS 4, LIGHTNING 3 Max Pacioretty delivered in the third round of a shootout as Montreal ended a six-game losing streak with a victory over host Tampa Bay. Brian Flynn also scored in the shootout for the Canadiens, who got goals from Tomas Plekanec, Alex Galchenyuk and Dale Weise. WILD 3, RED WINGS 1 Mikko Koivu scored twice, Devan Dubnyk made 28 saves in a surprise appearance, and Minnesota beat visiting Detroit. Dubnyk sustained a cut on his arm in practice Sunday and required stitches. He was expected to sit, but Darcy Kuemper was scratched with an upper-body injury about an hour before the game.",

    "source": "Knicks’ Playoff Slump Finally Ends <eos> For all the baggage inherited and hauled around, all the mishaps endured or missteps taken, the Knicks deserved one. If for no other reason that they showed up battered and bandaged, they merited an endgame buzzer that put a bounce in their steps and teeth in their smiles. They earned the streamers that fell from the Madison Square Garden rafters, a spontaneous celebration of sheer — and mere — survival. “I know what it’s like to be a winner in the playoffs — I can finally say that,” the second-year Knick Landry Fields said after Miami’s Dwyane Wade misfired on what would have been a series-ending 3-pointer from the right corner and the Knicks broke their 11-year playoff victory drought, 89-87. “It feels good.” It also seems almost inconceivable that a big-market franchise that spends as much money as the Knicks have from year to year could go so long without winning a measly postseason game. In the N.B.A. only the Charlotte Bobcats have failed to notch a playoff victory in that time and they have had the excuse of not existing before 2004 and more recently being run on a shoestring tied to Michael Jordan’s Nikes. The Knicks had last outscored a playoff opponent — the Toronto Raptors — on April 29, 2001. They had lost 13 straight until the Heat , leading the Eastern Conference series 3-0, contributed 11 missed free throws and 41 percent shooting to a philanthropic cause known as the long-suffering Knicks fan. Think about it: that last Knicks playoff victory came before 9/11, before the start of the war in Afghanistan. The drought easily exceeded America’s other marathon military action in Iraq. It consumed the better part of three presidential terms. It preceded Apple’s unveiling of the iPod in October 2001 and extended beyond the invention of the iPad . The Los Angeles Lakers won four championships between Knicks playoff victories and the San Antonio Spurs claimed three. The New England Patriots’ three-title dynasty in the N.F.L. happened and Eli Manning arrived in New Jersey in 2004 and won two titles for the Giants. Alex Rodriguez began a three-year run with the Texas Rangers the same month of the Knicks’ previous playoff triumph and has since played what feels like a lifetime — this being his ninth season — with the Yankees. And through all of the head-spinning events that spanned the globe, through so much dysfunction that enveloped the Knicks from regimes fronted by Scott Layden, then Isiah Thomas, then Donnie Walsh, Knicks fans kept showing up, filling the building. They have dealt with continuing change, embarrassing behavioral episodes, outrageous ticket price increases and other miseries foisted on them by the Family Dolan while waiting for something good to happen, for the streamers to come down. Yes, of course, fans had championship aspirations more in mind. But considering the alternatives, they took what they could get early Sunday night. They watched Carmelo Anthony finally finish his one-man show with a flourish and with 41 points that sent the Knicks off to Miami for Game 5 on Wednesday night, more crippled than ever but contemplating a miracle. Easy to please, the fans forgave Amar’e Stoudemire’s attempted smackdown of a fire extinguisher casing after Game 2 in Miami and roared for his 20 points and 10 rebounds as at least partial redemption. They chanted “Baron Davis” as the team’s latest casualty — a Knick for all of four months and change — was carried off on a stretcher and out of the series with a dislocated kneecap. Down to Mike Bibby, who delivered a clutch 3-pointer late in the game, at the point, the fans readied themselves for the next news cycle preoccupation, a possible return of Jeremy Lin, or Linsanity itself, to take more heat to South Beach. “He seems to be moving well, real well,” Fields said of Lin’s recent workouts, already stoking the story. “I hope so, although it’s up to the doctors and him.” Knicks fans will wait three days with bated breath. They will interpret Wade’s inability to exploit the defensive switch that left the vulnerable Stoudemire on him — “I lost control of the ball and had to take it out for 3,” Wade said — as a sign of something, anything, that might bring them back to the Garden on Friday night. Maybe the Heat will start to hear footsteps or have a player go down; that seems to be in the air this playoff season. Wade, for one, had his ankles in ice after Sunday’s game. Bottom line: don’t tell Knicks fans — that ever loyal band of wishful thinkers and Anthony worshipers — that no N.B.A. team has ever recovered from a 0-3 playoff deficit. Not after they finally left a playoff game without having to curse the fates while finding the rationalization to still care. “It was a great win for us and our fans to get over the hump,” Stoudemire said. “To finally get over the hump now and win a game today is great.” It was now or not until next year for the Knicks, several of whom won’t be back, and their fans, most of whom certainly will return just as they have season after deflating season. They all earned the win Sunday. But all things considered, the paying sufferers in the stands deserved it more.",

    "source": "Court in Venezuela Orders Release of a Judge Once Scorned and Jailed by Chávez <eos> During the three and a half years that she was held in prison or under house arrest, Judge Lourdes Afiuni became a symbol of political persecution for many in Venezuela under President Hugo Chávez. On Friday, a court in Caracas, acting at the government’s request, ordered Ms. Afiuni to be set free in the latest sign of a shifting political landscape in post-Chávez Venezuela. Ms. Afiuni was jailed in December 2009 after issuing a court ruling that infuriated Mr. Chávez, who went on television and demanded that she be sentenced to 30 years in prison. For years Mr. Chávez ignored international appeals for her release, including from the American leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky. Mr. Chávez, a charismatic socialist, died in March, leaving a bitterly divided country. His handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, was elected by a slim margin in April and since then has confronted political turmoil and serious economic difficulties that have tested his nascent leadership skills. As Mr. Maduro lurches from one crisis to the next, the quality he seems to have honed most is delivering mixed messages at top volume. He branded President Obama “the big boss of the devils” and then sent his foreign minister to shake hands with Secretary of State John Kerry and call for warmer relations. He assailed capitalists for causing soaring inflation and rampant product shortages and then sat down with the head of the country’s biggest private company to discuss the economy. And while he has relentlessly vilified the political opposition and the man he edged out in the election, Henrique Capriles Radonski, as traitors and coup plotters, his government has made some moves that could be seen as concessions to longstanding grievances of the opposition, which has been demanding Ms. Afiuni’s release. “There are lots of mixed signals,” said Elsa Cardozo, a professor of political science at the Central University of Venezuela. “It is clear the government of President Maduro is in a situation that is forcing it to make some changes in direction. What we don’t know is if they are permanent changes or tactical changes.” But while government opponents have long called for Ms. Afiuni’s release, the action may actually be intended to counter an opposition campaign to take its message abroad, with leaders visiting countries around the world to make the case that Mr. Maduro was unfairly declared the winner of a flawed election and that his government is repressive. The opposition routinely points to Ms. Afiuni as the most prominent among a group of what it calls political prisoners, who it says were jailed arbitrarily or were convicted in politically motivated trials. “I view it as a sign from the government to the outside world, the international community, that it is trying to show that it is respectful of human rights,” José Vicente Haro, a constitutional law expert, said of Ms. Afiuni’s release. Ms. Afiuni was arrested after she ordered a jailed businessman accused of evading currency controls freed while awaiting trial. She has said that the man had been held in custody for longer than Venezuelan law generally permitted under the circumstances and that her ruling complied with a recommendation by United Nations human rights monitors. Her lawyer, José Amalio Graterol, confirmed reports last year that she was raped while in prison, became pregnant and had an abortion, which led to other health problems. She was moved to house arrest in Caracas in 2011. Ms. Afiuni’s trial began last November and is continuing, although she has refused to attend it. Last week the national prosecutor’s office made a surprise announcement that it had asked a court to release Ms. Afiuni from house arrest, citing her need for medical treatment. The prosecutor asked the court to require her to report to the authorities every 15 days and to bar her from leaving the country and speaking to the news media. “A judge never should have been imprisoned for three years and six months for issuing a decision in accordance with the law,” Ms. Afiuni’s lawyer, Mr. Graterol, said Friday, adding that her case had intimidated other judges who feared defying the government.",

    "source": "Republican Candidates Set Fast Pace for Spending <eos> WASHINGTON, April 13 — Mitt Romney , whose presidential campaign leads the Republican primary field in fund-raising, spent nearly 60 percent of the $20.7 million he raised in the first quarter, setting a breakneck pace for the start of the 2008 race. Rudolph W. Giuliani , the runner-up in fund-raising among the Republicans , spent more than 40 percent of the $13.8 million his campaign brought in, leaving both candidates with roughly the same amount in the bank as of the beginning of April. Their expenses, disclosed Friday in first-quarter financial reports filed with the Federal Election Commission , underscore the heavy costs that each candidate has incurred to bring in their contributions and, in Mr. Romney’s case, raise his profile among voters. Mr. Romney, for his part, spent more than any candidate had even raised during this stage of the 2004 presidential race. He spent $11.6 million during the quarter. The reports also indicate the relatively narrow base of big donors behind each of the Republican primary’s two fund-raising leaders. Mr. Romney raised about $9.2 million, nearly half his first-quarter total, from about 4,000 contributors who gave the maximum $2,300 allowed under campaign finance laws. Mr. Giuliani’s primary campaign raised about $7.6 million, more than half its total, from about 3,300 donors who paid the maximum. About 430 gave an additional $2,300 to Mr. Giuliani’s general election fund, as well. With 32,000 donors, Mr. Romney’s average contribution was about $650. With about 28,000 donors, Mr. Giuliani’s average contribution was over $500. In contrast, the campaign of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, had 50,000 donors. The campaign of Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, had more than 100,000. Both had average contributions of about $250 a donor, based on their disclosures so far. The first-quarter reports are the first look at the scramble for money behind the 2008 presidential race. For the first time since the advent of public financing of presidential campaigns in the aftermath of Watergate, all the leading candidates are planning to reject public matching funds to spend without limits for the primary and the general election. Unlike the case before public financing, election laws now cap individual contributions — this year at $2,300 each for the primary and the general election — placing special importance on so-called bundlers who collect $2,300 checks from rich friends and associates. Candidates are required to file their reports by Sunday. Mr. Romney and Mr. Giuliani’s campaigns chose to file two days ahead of that deadline. Mr. Giuliani’s campaign filed in the morning, presumably to maximize attention to the amount of cash he has on hand. Dependence on a relatively small number of donors who have already contributed the maximum to the campaign could be a potential liability in part because it could make it hard for candidates to sustain their fund-raising pace. Candidates with a larger number of smaller contributors can go back to them again for more cash, and they can also cite their donor rolls as evidence of popular support. The Romney and Giuliani campaign reports provide snapshots of their respective candidacies. Mr. Romney began the campaign little known outside of Massachusetts, where he was governor; Michigan, where his father was governor; and Utah, where he was chief executive of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. And as he stepped forward to introduce himself to Republican primary voters, he came under fire from the right for past liberal stances on social issues like abortion (he says his views evolved). Mr. Romney had substantial financial resources. He is the multimillionaire founder of a major private equity firm, and his personal wealth gives his campaign a reserve if needed. (To jump-start his fund-raising, he lent the campaign $2.35 million.) His family is among the best-known in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, enabling him to tap networks of rich Mormons, as well as Wall Street financiers. He raised about $2.8 million in Utah, $2.3 million in Massachusetts and $1 million in Michigan — about 30 percent of his total. He raised more than $140,000 from executives of his former companies, Bain consulting and Bain Capital. Mr. Romney used his war chest to spend nearly $2 million on television advertising in selected states, much more than any of his primary rivals, to introduce himself to voters on his own terms before others could characterize him. He also spent heavily on fund-raising consultants in 16 states, for example paying more than $200,000 to buy a list of potential donors from a Virginia direct mail firm. Mr. Giuliani’s greatest asset, in contrast, is the fame he acquired as the mayor of New York after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. In a conference call to discuss the fund-raising report, Mr. Giuliani’s aides noted that they had raised most of their campaign contributions, about $10 million, in the last month of the quarter. They acknowledged a late start in spending and fund-raising, but said the big March demonstrated their momentum. Mr. Giuliani’s first-quarter report did little to address the question of whether he can extend his reputation for strength under fire into deeper support from Republican primary voters in other parts of the country, where his liberal views on social issues are not yet well known. Mr. Giuliani raised more than 30 percent of his first-quarter contributions from three states, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with about $4.5 million coming from the New York area and $1.3 million from Los Angeles. Employees of Mr. Giuliani’s law and consulting firms gave about $77,000. The rest of the presidential candidates are expected to file their reports over the weekend. In anticipation of new scrutiny, Mr. Obama, who raised $25 million during the first quarter, disclosed Friday that his campaign had returned 49 political contributions totaling $50,566 from registered lobbyists. Mr. Obama’s campaign has promised to refuse contributions from registered lobbyists. Accepting such donations is legal, and the Obama campaign has sought contributions from the clients of lobbyists or other interest parties. But the campaign has declared the ban on lobbyists’ money to burnish Mr. Obama’s image as a candidate intent on changing the business of Washington. The campaign said the checks were accepted inadvertently. “Giving back these donations is part of our best efforts to ensure we stay true to our commitment to not take money from federal lobbyists,” Bill Burton, a campaign spokesman, said. “As we’ve said and as this illustrates, this policy isn’t a perfect solution to the problem of money and politics and special interest sway in Washington.”",

    "source": "Google’s Next Stop May Be in Congress <eos> SAN FRANCISCO — Now that a judge has curtailed Google ’s ambitions to create a giant digital bookstore and library, the company is left with few appealing options. Google and groups representing publishers and authors were assessing their options Wednesday, trying to figure out whether they would remain allies or become enemies again. The two sides seemed unlikely to agree on a new settlement. Their original settlement, which would have let Google scan and make available every book ever published, was rejected by a federal judge Tuesday, the latest twist in a seven-year legal process. Instead, Google may take the battle from the courtroom to Congress, to promote a law that would make orphan works — books that are still under copyright but whose author or copyright owner can’t be found — widely available. “The publishers have said, ‘We want to settle,’ but Google’s motivation to settle is quite a bit lower,” said Pamela Samuelson, an expert in digital copyright law at the University of California, Berkeley, who has opposed the settlement. Still, she said, Google, which has already scanned 15 million books, is unlikely to give up. “The next thing to do is think about going to Congress and getting legislation that would make particularly orphan works available to the public,” she said. Aside from appealing the decision of the judge, Denny Chin , publishers and authors have several choices. They could drop or revive their original copyright lawsuit against Google, which claimed that even Google’s more modest initial plan to scan books and show snippets of their text was illegal. Those issues have never been litigated. Dropping the suit seems unlikely given the amount of money and time the publishers have already invested in the fight, said people briefed on the negotiations but who were not authorized to discuss them publicly because they were confidential. Several analysts said the publishers would like to avoid going to court. Another option, which publishers and authors said Wednesday was attractive to them, would be to reach a new settlement with Google that requires each author or copyright owner to opt in and permit Google to digitize their works. Judge Chin said that many of his concerns would be ameliorated if the parties came to this agreement. “We’d love to sit down with our negotiating partners and arrive at a very quick solution,” said Scott Turow, president of the Authors Guild, which was a party to the original settlement. “But given the complexity of this, the Cubs might win the World Series before this is resolved.” Google, which declined to discuss the case on Wednesday, has called the opt-in solution unworkable. Google would not be interested in such an agreement because it already allows publishers to join with Google to show more of their digitized works, and the point of the original settlement was to automatically opt in vast quantities of books, said people briefed on the settlement who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. The settlement also would have given Google exclusive access to millions of orphan works. By agreeing to an opt-in arrangement, Google would lose those books because there are no clear copyright owners to opt in. Scholars estimate that half of all books may be orphans. These range from privately published autobiographies to books that are vital for academics and researchers and are stored in university libraries. Congress has twice considered legislation to address orphan works, spurred on by a 2006 report by the United States Copyright Office that recommended free use of orphan works if there had been a diligent search for the owner. But the legislation was stymied because policy makers were waiting for the outcome of the Google Books settlement, Professor Samuelson said. Judge Chin pointed to such efforts in his ruling , saying that “the establishment of a mechanism for exploiting unclaimed books is a matter more suited for Congress than this court.” Advocates of open access to orphan works cheered the rejection of the settlement, saying it could pave the way for legislation that would let anyone — not just Google — use the books.. “If Congress can wake up to the importance of this issue, there’s a good chance they will pass orphan books legislation, and they will do so in the interest of the general public, not favoring any enterprise,” said Robert Darnton, director of the Harvard University Library, who is helping to lead a project to create a nonprofit digital library. Google has endorsed such legislation in the past, and people briefed on the negotiations said they expected Google to now aggressively pursue it in Congress. That might be the only thing all sides agree on, said Hadrian R. Katz, a lawyer who argued against Google on behalf of his client, the Internet Archive. “I think there’d be a renewed effort to get that kind of legislation, which would probably be in everybody’s interest,” he said.",

But the behind-the-scenes tug of war between banks and the government over the results of their recent stress tests strains the already tenuous credibility of the exercise. It also shows that banks have become too powerful. How so? First, banks and their regulators run stress tests all the time, on individual products, divisions and the institutions as a whole. Without them, it would be very difficult to manage risk or allocate capital among business lines. The current crisis proved these tests were inadequate — or in some cases, ignored by bank managers. But that’s largely because of management incentives to take excessive risks, and the failure of the tests to use sufficiently grim projections. So it’s curious that regulators have put so much stock in the tests they announced in February. The release of their results has been delayed while banks ask for clemency. Since the results will determine which institutions will be forced to raise private capital or take further government infusions, the stakes are high. But like the banks’ earlier and insufficiently stressful stress tests, the government’s worst-case outlooks aren’t all that far-fetched. They also use banks’ own estimates, meaning unscrupulous managers could tweak them to get a better grade. And bankers say they’ll produce very little information that regulators don’t already have. Because of this, bank risk managers (not the most credible group these days) tend to view these tests as a public relations stunt that regulators will use to force their institutions to toe Uncle Sam’s line. That, in itself, is worrying. Regulators shouldn’t have to invent justifications for regulating properly. The right response by a bank when its overseer says jump is, “How high?” That regulators are wrangling with banks over the results of these tests shows that they are not confident in their ability to understand the institutions. That gives banks too much power because regulators are forced to rely on many of their assertions about, say, complex products’ values. It would be better for watchdogs to demand that they reduce their complexity to comprehensible levels. Otherwise the banks will retain the upper hand and no amount of testing will be sufficient to diagnose their problems. May Day’s Softer Side “What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers.” Stirring words, but they won’t be on the lips of the union protesters clogging the streets of big European cities on Monday, the May Day bank holiday. If the marchers want a rallying cry relevant to the current crisis of capitalism, they won’t find it in the grim conclusion to Marx’s Communist Manifesto. The worst recession in decades might have been expected to spawn more widespread violence than it has. European unemployment is up sharply, to 8.9 percent in the euro zone and 17.4 percent in Spain. There are now 14 million nonworkers in the euro zone. But these seemingly alarming rates of unemployment aren’t exceptional by the standards of the last two decades. And while unemployment can be hard on those it affects, Europe’s jobless don’t seem to be suffering enough to do much more than moan. Unemployment benefits are generous, health care is widely available, homelessness is minimal. Unemployment has lost it stigma as well as its sting. The jobless include many with a socially acceptable reason for being out of work — early retirement, extended education, widening definitions of disability, or just taking a break. That may explain why governments have to prod hard to get people back to work. But the complacency of nonworkers cuts both ways. It is frustrating, in that their return to the labor force would help restore economic balance by lowering wages and reducing the burden on government. But the relative lack of violence is also a sign of economic success. In precapitalist days, a downturn meant famine. Industrial workers were often destitute in Marx’s time. If this crisis is the worst that modern capitalism can manage, then bosses, workers and nonworkers should really unite on May Day to celebrate. DWIGHT CASS and EDWARD HADAS",

    "source": "France Dares to Dream as Tsonga Defeats Federer <eos> PARIS — Jo-Wilfried Tsonga’s surprisingly straightforward 7-5, 6-3, 6-3 quarterfinal victory over Roger Federer on Tuesday at the French Open could be seen through two different lenses. It could be seen through the lens of a Federer analyst, who now has more confirmation than ever of a great and classy champion’s slow fade from Grand Slam power. There were hints aplenty under pressure in the brilliant Paris sunshine: shots off the frame; leaps that did not appear to leave as much space between the red clay and Federer’s sneakers as usual; missed opportunities off short balls; and even — gasp — missed overheads. “Missing smashes goes hand in hand with missing so many other things,” said Federer, sounding more melancholy than devastated. But there was also the much more rose-colored lens available to Tsonga observers, of which there will now be millions more than usual in France after this performance. Tsonga, a 28-year-old who professes to prefer the quiet life of the Swiss countryside to the Parisian party scene, does not yet have a Grand Slam title. But he undeniably has charisma, just like France’s last men’s singles champion at Roland Garros — Yannick Noah, who won here with brio in 1983 and remains one of France’s most popular men 30 years later. It still seems early to start talking about history repeating itself. The pretournament favorites — the seven-time champion Rafael Nadal and the top-ranked Novak Djokovic — are still in contention in the other half of the draw and on course for a semifinal showdown. But the sixth-seeded Tsonga does have an opening in his half, with a semifinal on Friday against David Ferrer of Spain rather than a bona-fide member of the game’s Big Four. Ferrer, 31, unlike Tsonga, has never reached a major final. But the bad news for those boarding the French bandwagon is that the fourth-seeded Ferrer, like Tsonga, has yet to drop a set in Paris this year and was in relentless, energy-conserving form again Tuesday as he overwhelmed his compatriot Tommy Robredo, 6-2, 6-1, 6-1, in 1 hour 26 minutes. Image Roger Federer, the 17-time Grand Slam champion, lost to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 7-5, 6-3, 6-3, on Tuesday. Credit Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters “I wasn’t 100 percent ready to fight that match and playing with a guy like David, who is a machine, it’s very tough to be like that,” said Robredo, who had reached the quarterfinals by coming back three times in a row from two sets down to win. No, it will not be easy for Tsonga, soaring confidence and all, to reach even the final in Paris this year, but the French are officially dreaming of another 1983 and another Noah. “It’s not too early to think about it because they are both charismatic players; because it’s been exactly 30 years and because they are both French guys of mixed race,” said Cédric Pioline, the former French star and French Open semifinalist. “There are parallels that are there right in front of us, that are true and that we cannot ignore.” “The atmosphere that was there today, you could almost feel like it was a final. The semifinal against Ferrer will be another note higher and if Jo does indeed manage to reach the final, I don’t know who’ll be across the net but it won’t be a French player that’s for sure, and the atmosphere behind him will be enormous, enormous. There will be so much energy and if he can put both his fingers right into the socket and feel all that power, it will be, wow, like triple turbo.” Asked what kind of relationship he had with Noah, now a popular singer, Tsonga said: “Well, when he sings, I dance. That’s my relationship. When he says something to me, I listen to him.” For now, France and Tsonga will have to settle for his victory over Federer, who had beaten him in 9 of their 12 previous matches, most recently at this year’s Australian Open in a five-set crowd pleaser that seemed to predict a closer match Tuesday. Federer struck first, breaking Tsonga in the fifth game, and was soon up by 4-2. But he could not hold a 40-15 lead in his next service game and Tsonga never trailed again, dominating with his first serve and punching holes with surprising ease in Federer’s defenses. Tsonga’s weaknesses have long been clear: returns and a backhand that has lacked the pop of his world-class serve and forehand. But he did damage with it regularly Tuesday, perhaps the result made under new coach Roger Rasheed. Tsonga spent more than a season without an official coach trying to understand his game and motivations before hiring Rasheed this year. Rasheed, an Australian, was previously the taskmaster and innovator in chief with Lleyton Hewitt and Tsonga’s compatriot Gaël Monfils. “I choose to take Roger, because I knew this guy was able to give me the passion for the game and to give me his passion for the game,” Tsonga said. Image Sixth-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, left, defeated No. 2 Roger Federer in straight sets Tuesday as he bids to become the first Frenchman to win the French Open in 30 years. Credit Matthew Stockman/Getty Images While Federer had to settle for that lone break in the first set, Tsonga broke Federer eight times in all, winning 42 percent of the points on Federer’s first serve and 58 percent of the points on Federer’s second serve. Federer rebuffed any suggestion that he was suffering from a revival of the back problems that have affected him intermittently. “No, no issues,” he said. “They have so much more energy here, the French guys, than maybe elsewhere,” Federer said of Tsonga. “I thought he played great today. He was in all areas better than me today. That’s why the result was pretty clean.” Federer, a 17-time Grand Slam singles champion, will now try to defend his Wimbledon title. Grass-court tennis has lifted him out of the doldrums in the past, but this season has been particularly disappointing by his standards. He has not won a tournament since Cincinnati last August, and although he reached the semifinals at the Australian Open, he has reached only one final this year. That was in Rome, where Nadal overwhelmed him, once again, on clay. Tsonga has spoiled major moments for Federer in the quarterfinals before. At Wimbledon in 2011, he became the first man to overcome a two-set deficit and beat Federer in a Grand Slam tournament. Tsonga, whose only appearance in a Grand Slam final came at the 2008 Australian Open, may also be less intimidated by Federer than ever. They spent considerable time together in the off-season in South America, with Tsonga playing second fiddle to Federer’s Stradivarius on the Swiss superstar’s lucrative tour of the continent. There is a genuine connection between them now, but that did not remove the sting of being upstaged on a court where Federer had only been beaten in straight sets in his prime by clay-court royalty like Nadal, Novak Djokovic and the former champion Gustavo Kuerten. At 3-3 in the third set Tuesday, with Federer facing yet another break point, he came forward and hit a deft half volley that dropped on Tsonga’s side of the net. The Frenchman sprinted forward and ripped a low, lunging, two-handed backhand that grazed the net and left Federer twisting to get out of the way. The ball struck him in the upper back, giving Tsonga the last break he would require, and though he held up his hand to apologize, Federer never looked back. “Come on, Roger!” someone yelled from the stands, as so many have yelled from these stands through the years. But this was a different sort of day, no matter how you looked at it, and cheers of “Allez Jo!” were much more common down the stretch. Just imagine the sound effects if Tsonga keeps winning.",

    "source": "Xavier and Cincinnati Regrouped and Found Postseason Success <eos> One player lay at midcourt, blood pouring off his face. Another was throwing punches at every opponent he could see. A third stood on the scorer’s table, egging on a howling crowd at the Cintas Center in Cincinnati. Expletive-laced challenges were hurled back and forth. All the while, a national television audience watched as one of college basketball’s fiercest rivalries exploded into chaos. The reputations of the two teams involved appeared to be in tatters. Yet now, little more than three months after a Dec. 10 brawl that was, for better or worse, one of the signature moments of college basketball’s regular season, both Xavier and Cincinnati are among the 16 teams left in the N.C.A.A. tournament. And the wild brawl has become, if not forgotten, then certainly a secondary chapter to the teams’ seasons. The Bearcats, seeded sixth in the East, will play No. 2 Ohio State in Boston on Thursday night. The 10th-seeded Musketeers will play No. 3 Baylor in a South Region game in Atlanta on Friday. “We disciplined the guys that did wrong, we apologized, and then we told them how much we loved them, what we expected of them, and moved on,” Cincinnati Coach Mick Cronin said Wednesday. “We knew who we really are. We really focused on making sure we were having fun and not letting that define us.” The tension that exists between Cincinnati — the large public university — and Xavier — the smaller, more affluent Jesuit university a few miles away — mounted a few days before their annual matchup in December. Bearcats guard Sean Kilpatrick needled Xavier’s star guard Tu Holloway, saying that Holloway, the reigning Atlantic 10 player of the year, was not even good enough to start for Cincinnati, which plays in the Big East. The game was heated, with the teams exchanging words on the way to the locker room at halftime. But as Xavier pulled away to what would be a 76-53 victory, the trash talk became more intense. Holloway made a layup with 18 seconds left and yelled at the Cincinnati bench as he ran past on his way back up the court. As the final seconds ticked away, Holloway and the Cincinnati freshman guard Ge’Lawn Guyn went nose to nose. Guyn pushed Holloway in the face, and Xavier’s Dez Wells shoved Guyn to the floor in retaliation. Cincinnati center Yancy Gates then threw the ball at Holloway, causing a full-scale brawl to erupt. Gates then threw a punch at Xavier center Kenny Frease, who was looking elsewhere. The right cross opened up a nasty gash under Frease’s left eye. The Bearcats’ Cheikh Mbodj then kicked Frease after he fell to the floor following a hit by Gates. Frease managed to escape the melee and wander upcourt, bleeding profusely, before lying down and receiving treatment. The game was called with 9.4 seconds left, and the floor was cleared after several minutes. In the postgame news conference, Holloway, who had been up on the scorer’s table during the brawl, said that the Musketeers were “grown men over here,” adding: “We’ve got a whole bunch of gangsters in the locker room — not thugs, but tough guys on the court. And we went out there and zipped them up,” an apparent reference to putting the Bearcats in body bags. Cronin talked angrily after the game of physically removing the jerseys of his players, saying they needed to realize “how lucky they are to even be here, let alone have a scholarship.” “Mick Cronin did a remarkable job of dealing with that head-on in the postgame press conference and obviously in the locker room with his own team,” Dan Gavitt, the associate commissioner of basketball for the Big East, said. “There’s no preparation or script for an incident like that, and he stood up and said the right things and did the right things and in the long run his team benefitted from it.” Xavier Coach Chris Mack sent out a Twitter message after the game that said: “If my players say they’ve been taught to be tough their whole life, they mean ON THE FLOOR. Nothing else is condoned.” Gates, Mbodj, and the Cincinnati freshman Octavius Ellis were given six-game suspensions, with Guyn suspended for a game. Gates tearfully apologized the day after the brawl, and his private apology to Frease was reportedly a factor in his not facing criminal charges. Xavier suspended four players, three of them starters, including Holloway, who missed the next game, a loss to Oral Roberts. The Musketeers, who had been 8-0 after beating Cincinnati, lost the two games after that as well. They struggled during Atlantic 10 conference play, and went 13-12 after the brawl. “After that game our confidence was lost a little bit,” Holloway said last week, “and it took a couple of months to get it back.” It was in the conference tournament in Atlantic City that Xavier righted itself, making the title game, where it lost to St. Bonaventure. Holloway then showed that he could start for any team in the country, scoring 25 points in Xavier’s N.C.A.A. tournament opener against Notre Dame, including a high-arcing bank shot with 21.3 seconds to go that put Xavier ahead for good. He added 21 in the Musketeers’ victory over Lehigh last Sunday, to go with Frease’s 25 points and 12 rebounds. “The adversity we see in the N.C.A.A. tournament, we’ve been through a lot more than that,” Frease said before the Lehigh game. At the time of the brawl, Cincinnati was 5-3, but the fallout seemed to galvanize the team. The Bearcats won seven straight after the Xavier game, and went 12-6 in Big East play and made the conference tournament final, upsetting top-seeded Syracuse. Gates had a double-double in the opening tournament win over Texas, then played a rugged game against Florida State on Sunday night, battling larger players inside in a 62-56 win. And despite being a 60 percent free-throw shooter, Gates made three critical free throws in the final moments. Now Cincinnati finds itself in the Round of 16, just like its crosstown rival, Xavier. It is a long way from the ugliness of Dec. 10. “We’ve been on a mission to define what Cincinnati basketball is all about, what our university and city is all about, and the kids have banded together to do that,” Cronin said. “It hasn’t been easy.”",

    "source": "Giants’ Jason Pierre-Paul Makes First Comments Since Fireworks Accident <eos> EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Alternately smiling and somber, Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul said Friday that he felt lucky to be alive after a Fourth of July fireworks accident caused the amputation of his right index finger and severely damaged his right thumb and middle finger. “I’m just very fortunate that I’m alive,” Pierre-Paul said in his first comments to the news media since the accident. “I’m just fortunate to have a hand.” During the hospitalization for his injuries, he said, he was near others with Fourth of July-related wounds. “I saw a kid die at the age of 12 years old,” Pierre-Paul said. “One they had to cut off his whole finger.” He added that “there were probably 12 people in that hospital” with similar injuries and that his hand was “the best one.” Pierre-Paul declined to be specific about his accident, although he said he had set off fireworks on the holiday for the past six or seven years for children around his South Florida neighborhood. “Things happen, mistakes happen, incidents happen,” he said. Asked for his initial reaction when the fireworks injured his hand, he replied: “I wasn’t worried at all. I wasn’t in shock or nothing. I looked at my hand and my fiancée was going crazy, but I kept calm through the whole situation.” Pierre-Paul indicated there was more to the story, which he said he planned to tell at a later date. He said Friday was not the right time to be more revealing because he wanted to focus on helping the Giants win games. Asked if he was suggesting that the accident was not his fault, Pierre-Paul replied: “No, I’m not saying that. By me buying the fireworks, it was my fault.” He was aware that he had been harshly criticized and mocked nationwide for actions and decisions that have so far cost him millions in salary. But he did not agree with those sentiments. “I wasn’t embarrassed by nothing,” he said. “People are going to have their own opinions. But I didn’t care about none of that because I knew one way or another, I was going to return back to football. Just coming back to the Giants, I’ve already won.” Pierre-Paul, who rubbed his left hand across his surgically reconstructed right hand repeatedly as he spoke for 12 minutes with reporters at his locker, was making no predictions about how effective he would be as a football player. But he defiantly announced that he felt no different from before. He is expected to play next month. “I am the Jason Pierre-Paul I was last year,” he said. “The skill set is the same. It’s not going to be a major adjustment. As far as like my hand goes, I’ll get used to it.” The Giants rank second to last in the N.F.L. in quarterback sacks this season. “Just looking at the games, you can tell they needed a pass rusher,” said Pierre-Paul, who will wear a special glove while playing. Laughing, he said: “Of course, it’s a special glove. I’m missing an index finger.” Pierre-Paul denied rebuffing Giants medical personnel who arrived at his hospital shortly after his accident. “You can’t do nothing when you’re on anesthesia, waking up, going in and out” of consciousness, he said. “I had no reason not to let them in. I just didn’t know. “I don’t know who was making my decisions. It could’ve been the doctors.” When pressed on why he stayed out of touch with the Giants for months after the accident, Pierre-Paul responded, “Next question.” Later, he credited the Giants for being “a very caring organization.” “They did a great job handling it,” he said. “I thank them for giving me a second chance.” Not surprisingly, Pierre-Paul added that his days exploding fireworks on the Fourth of July were over. “As far as fireworks, they’re very dangerous,” he said. “You shouldn’t play with them. Because it had been seven years I did it and it just went off. “You live and learn. People make mistakes. We’re all human. We’re all people.”",

    "source": "A 3-D Printed Car, Ready for the Road <eos> DETROIT — TUCKED away among the gleaming steel machines on display at the North American International Auto Show this week, an Arizona start-up was trying something new: manufacturing a car from scratch right on the convention floor. Thanks to 3-D printing, a vehicle whose body, frame and interior were constructed from a carbon-polymer composite materialized as puzzled onlookers watched. After workers installed an electric motor, suspension and tires, the small car — which resembled a coupe crossed with a dune buggy — was ready to go. The idea was the brainchild of John B. Rogers Jr., the founder and chief executive of Local Motors, based in Phoenix. Mr. Rogers, who prefers to be called Jay, was an infantry commander in the Marines, has an M.B.A. from Harvard and is determined to simplify the way automobiles are produced. Mr. Rogers is no stranger to mobile machines: His grandfather ran the Indian Motorcycle Company and was also the first distributor of Cummins engines in the United States. He himself started a small custom rally-car business in Arizona in 2007, Local Motors. But two years ago, as he read about the auto industry’s attempts to make lighter auto panels and parts, he had an epiphany. “It occurred to me that our enemy was the supply chain. There are just too many parts,” he said in an interview. “That was the genesis of all this.” The question though, was what could be done about it. Cars need parts, thousands of them. Mr. Rogers said he started obsessing about the idea of making a vehicle from a few solid pieces, and began looking for a material. He talked to experts about hardened clay, but that went nowhere. Other options, deemed impractical, also fizzled out. Then a colleague attending a conference in Boston happened to cross paths with an engineer from Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, who invited Mr. Rogers to visit the lab. Inside was an enormous device with a robot arm that emitted moldable plastic and made shapes — a 3-D printer. “As soon as I saw that, I said, ‘That’s my machine,’ ” Mr. Rogers said. “I asked, ‘Can we make a car?’ ” This week in Detroit, he showed off the answer — part of a road show in recent months as he has traveled the country with his creation, the Strati concept vehicle. Aside from a few dozen additional components, like the electric motor, wheels and suspension parts, the small concept car is made from 3-D printed carbon-polymer material. On Monday, Mr. Rogers announced bigger plans: Local Motors would build a production factory outside Washington, capable of making up to 3,000 3-D printed vehicles a year. The so-called microfactory, Local Motors’ fourth, is set to be completed within a year and will sell cars to the public. The company has its original microfactory in Phoenix and another in Las Vegas. It is also building one in Oak Ridge, Tenn., near the national laboratory, its partner. Part retail store, part factory, the Washington plant will let consumers browse the designs, customize their cars, then have them created on one of the half-dozen industrial-grade 3-D printers on site and assembled in a matter of days. “We like to think of it as Build-A-Bear, mashed up with Ikea, mashed up with Formula One,” Mr. Rogers said. But the cars may not be entirely street legal. Local Motors’ first 3-D-printed car is categorized as a “neighborhood electric vehicle ,” much like a golf cart. Under federal regulations, it is legal on public roads at speeds up to 25 miles per hour, and some states allow certain road access up to 45 miles per hour. The company plans to offer a vehicle that can be driven on all roads in the United States by 2017, Mr. Rogers said. That would require passing safety requirements set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, including crash tests. Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com, said that while the market for customization of cars was blossoming, a 3-D-printed car remained “a bit gimmicky at this point in time.” Noting that the price begins at $18,000 and tops out at $30,000, she said most buyers would opt for a vehicle with more traditional amenities. “I struggle to understand the value to the consumer besides having something cool and cutting-edge,” she said. Terry Wohlers, president of the research firm Wohlers Associates, which tracks the 3-D printing industry, said while he did not anticipate the Fords or Toyotas of the world adopting 3-D-printed car bodies any time soon, the idea might work on a smaller scale. “If you’re looking at low quantity, individualized kind of production, that could make sense,” Mr. Wohlers said. “But right now, the cost is too prohibitive to use for large-scale production.” And although Toyota may not use 3-D printing for its Camrys, the major automakers have already adopted the technology when it comes to designing their cars: building models quickly, and testing the form, fit and function of certain elements. “They’re all using it in a big way,” Mr. Wohlers said. Some high-end automakers are going even further, integrating select 3-D-printed parts into production models. Examples include Lamborghini, which uses the technology for part of a console component, and Bentley, where part of a dashboard panel was printed that way, he said. “Over time, we will see more of them adopt this kind of technology, if not for whole cars, for certain hard-to-produce or complicated parts that 3-D printing can make easier,” he said. The cost of 3-D printing machines is also likely to drop. Currently, plastics-based machines average around $75,000, and machines that can 3-D print metal, a relatively new invention, cost upward of $500,000 each. Mr. Rogers said Local Motors believed that a market existed for locally produced, individualized vehicles made with 3-D printing. “This is not just a science experiment, but is something that can be developed, brought forward safely and enjoyed by consumers around the world,” he said. “It’s about allowing local communities, and people within those communities, to tailor vehicles to suit their individual needs.”",

    "source": "A Cruel Beauty in Grudge Match of the Dons <eos> MILTON KEYNES, ENGLAND — The F.A. Cup, the oldest knockout tournament of them all, was founded on the belief that playing soccer could settle any score. But nothing in its 140 years could have been more of a grudge match than the one played Sunday between the Milton Keynes Dons and A.F.C. Wimbledon. The teams have a shared past, and that is the cause of their bitter dispute. Fans of the original Wimbledon F.C., the 1988 F.A. Cup winner, accuse Milton Keynes of being an illegitimate club — of stealing Wimbledon’s name and its place in the English leagues almost a decade ago. What happened was that Wimbledon was going bankrupt when Milton Keynes, a new town with no team in the professional ranks, persuaded the Football Association to allow it to leapfrog the minor leagues and to “move” Wimbledon 56 miles, or about 90 kilometers, north of its west London location. Hence the name MK Dons, as in Wimble-don. Resentment and rancor have existed ever since and have been the spur to a remarkable rise that took a newly formed, renamed A.F.C. Wimbledon, just nine years to go from volunteers on Wimbledon Common up through five promotions of the semiprofessional pyramid of English soccer until it reached the fourth tier of full-time competition. A.F.C. stands today just one division below Milton Keynes. As fate would have it, the Wimbledon team, still wholly run by a fans’ trust, was drawn to play at Milton Keynes in the second round of the F.A. Cup on Sunday. On a bright and frosty morning, some 3,200 Wimbledon supporters made the hour and a half journey. Others, who had sworn never to set foot in Milton Keynes, gathered at their own club headquarters to watch the game on TV screens. Perhaps against the odds, the contest was even until the final moments of time added on for injuries and stoppages. Milton Keynes did most of the attacking, Wimbledon held on in robust defense and broke with defiant will. Even the Wimbledon hard-liners who had arrived at the stadium with face masks and full anticontamination suits were by this time under the thrall of the game. Soccer, as the founding fathers had envisaged, was engaging all minds, breaking down the bitterness. But then, as someone said, the cruel beauty of the F.A. Cup arrived. The man who said that, Lawrie Sanchez, had scored the only goal of the 1988 final when Wimbledon F.C., top dog of all the underdogs, defeated the mighty Liverpool to win the Cup at Wembley Stadium. The Sanchez side, known as the Crazy Gang, would do anything and everything, even bending the rules if they could get away with it, to win. The new Wimbledon is muscular, spirited and, as it showed Sunday, will do everything within the laws to stay in a contest. How they ran. How they stayed compact in defense. How they retaliated after Milton Keynes’s Stephen Gleeson scored on the stroke of halftime with a wonderful shot. He struck it from 30 meters, or about 100 feet, and the trajectory left Wimbledon’s 42-year-old veteran keeper groping at air as the ball swerved away into the top left corner of his net. Little by little, Wimbledon turned defense into attack. On the hour, midfielder Jack Midsun turned industrious running into gold. He passed the ball out wide to the winger Toby Ajala. And, bursting his lungs to keep on running, Midsun demanded the return pass, threw himself head first at the ball and guided it from right to left inside the far post. One-one, and a replay at Wimbledon — a second game in case of a draw worth upward of $150,000 in TV revenue — beckoned. A plane circling overhead in the blue sky trailed a banner “We are Wimbledon.” Apparently it was hired by a fan of the original team who could not be there because he is a resident of West Virginia. That fan doubtless suffered the cruel beauty of the Cup in the closing minutes. Right on full time, Wimbledon broke into another counterattack. Steven Gregory found the power to burst past his opposing defender, but his low shot was diverted inches around the foot of a post by the fingertips of goalie David Martin. The sheer relief of Milton Keynes then turned into an eruption of sound seldom heard in the 30,000-seat stadium, built when the team acquired the status and identity of the doomed old Dons. It was MK’s turn to break the length of the field and, from a corner that Wimbledon failed to clear, the home team’s right back, Jon Otsemobor, did something he will never regret or forget. He nonchalantly stuck out his left leg to the bouncing ball. He caught it with a flick he might claim was intended, but few will believe him. It glanced off his shin and deceived everyone in the crowded goal mouth. It nestled in the net. Cruel beauty, indeed. The Cup tie was over, but the resentment may linger for generations. Milton Keynes’s founder, the property developer and former musical entrepreneur Pete Winkelman, is the man who negotiated the land deal that allowed supermarket chains to pay enough to share it with a soccer club that at that time scarcely existed. Winkelman admits now that this transaction — akin to a franchise moving across states in the United States — may never happen again in England. But he refuses Wimbledon’s requests to a least remove the word Dons from his club’s title. He has a victory, but few admirers west of London.",

    "source": "Palin Defends Political Speech; ‘Blood Libel’ Stirs Critics <eos> WASHINGTON — Sarah Palin broke her silence on Wednesday and delivered a forceful denunciation of her critics in a video message about the Arizona shootings , accusing commentators and journalists of “blood libel” in a frenzied rush to blame heated political speech for the violence. As she sought to defend herself and seize control of a debate that has been boiling for days, Ms. Palin awakened a new controversy by invoking a phrase fraught with religious symbolism about the false accusation used by anti-Semites of Jews murdering Christian children. It was unclear whether Ms. Palin was aware of the historical meaning of the phrase. “Acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own,” Ms. Palin said. “Especially within hours of a tragedy unfolding, journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence that they purport to condemn. That is reprehensible.” The video from Ms. Palin, running nearly eight minutes, was recorded in her home television studio in Alaska and released early Wednesday morning. Her words dominated the political landscape for nearly 12 hours before President Obama arrived in Tucson to speak at a memorial service honoring the six dead and 14 injured in the shootings. For Ms. Palin, a former Alaska governor, the video provided one of the clearest signs yet that she is carefully tending to her image as she decides whether to seek the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. And it showed her continued determination to do so on her own terms and under her own control, without responding to questions or appearing in a public forum. She spoke in a somber tone, absent the witticisms often woven into her political speeches, as she sought to contain a debate that had linked her — unfairly, she argued — with the assassination attempt on Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona. In the midterm elections last year, Ms. Palin used a map with cross hairs over several swing Congressional districts, which Ms. Giffords highlighted in a television interview at the time as an example of overheated political speech. In the video statement, Ms. Palin rejected criticism of the map, and sought to cast that criticism as a broader indictment of the basic rights to free speech exercised by people of all political persuasions. “We know violence isn’t the answer,” Ms. Palin said, sitting against a backdrop of a fireplace and an American flag. “When we take up our arms, we’re talking about our votes.” The video stirred an emotional response from some Democratic lawmakers, Jewish groups and even some fellow Republicans, who said it was in poor taste for Ms. Palin to deliver her statement on a day that was devoted to remembering victims of last weekend’s shooting. The video played throughout the day on cable television and on the Internet. Matthew Dowd, a former political adviser to President George W. Bush who has become a frequent critic of Republicans, said that the tone of Ms. Palin’s message was not appropriate for the moment of national grief and that she had missed an opportunity to be seen as a leader. “Sarah Palin seems trapped in a world that is all about confrontation and bravado,” Mr. Dowd said. “When the country seeks comforting and consensus, she offers conflict and confrontation.” Advisers to Ms. Palin did not respond to interview requests on Wednesday, and she did not cite any specific examples of what she considered to be unfair coverage or commentary. Ms. Palin offered her deep condolences for victims of the shooting, then went on to dismiss suggestions that political speech should be toned down. She did not mention the shooting suspect, Jared L. Loughner, by name, but said that the violence could not be blamed on talk radio or those who participated in political debate. “There are those who claim political rhetoric is to blame for the despicable act of this deranged apparently apolitical criminal,” Ms. Palin said. “And they claim political debate has somehow gotten more heated just recently. But when was it less heated — back in those calm days when political figures literally settled their differences with dueling pistols?” Ms. Palin also turned to the words of former President Ronald Reagan, saying that society should not be blamed for the acts of an individual. She said she had spent the last several days “praying for guidance,” as she sorted out the lessons of the Arizona tragedy. “We must reject the idea that every time a law’s broken, society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker,” Ms. Palin said. “It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions.” The video , which seemed to be aimed at appealing to her committed supporters rather than winning over her critics, contained several references to the country’s “foundational freedoms” and the intentions of the nation’s founders. Twice, she called the United States “exceptional,” a frequent dig at Mr. Obama, whom conservatives accuse of not believing in the concept of “American exceptionalism.” The White House did not comment on Ms. Palin’s statement, and the president did not mention her in his address on Wednesday evening. “President Obama and I may not agree on everything,” she said, “but I know he would join me in affirming the health of our democratic process.”",

    "source": "Violence Spurs Identity Crisis in Free-Spirited Santa Cruz <eos> SANTA CRUZ, Calif. — Keep it weird? Or keep it safe and clean? “Keep Santa Cruz Weird” was the longstanding, if unofficial, motto for this small beachfront city proud of its tolerance and its offbeat vibe. People came for Santa Cruz’s 1960s-imbued live-and-let-live attitude, its progressive politics, the great weather, the University of California campus, the hard-partying surfing scene and the freewheeling drug culture. But “Keep Santa Cruz Safe and Clean” began appearing on bumpers in recent years as the city was rattled by acts of violence, its streets and parks seemingly overwhelmed by homelessness and drugs. To hear the supporters of the new slogan, Santa Cruz’s famous tolerance was guilty of enabling. The dueling slogans captured the fight over the city’s politics and policies, as well as its spirit. The debate has only intensified since the recent killings of Sgt. Butch Baker and Officer Elizabeth Butler, the first two police officers to die on duty in the Santa Cruz Police Department’s 157-year history. On Feb. 26, the two went to speak to Jeremy Goulet, 35, an Army veteran with a history of sexual assaults in the military and in civilian life. Mr. Goulet, who had been arrested after trying to attack a co-worker in her home here, gunned down the officers before being killed later in a shootout. He had run-ins with the law in Portland, Ore., and Berkeley, Calif., before moving to Santa Cruz late last year. Image An officer at the scene in Santa Cruz, Calif., where two colleagues were fatally shot in February. Credit Thomas Mendoza/Associated Press “It could have happened in any one of those communities — it happened here,” Mayor Hilary Bryant said. “It’s particularly difficult for us as a community to deal with that because it happened on top of a series of incidents of violence in a short period of time.” Last month, a man was shot to death outside a popular bar, and a student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was shot in the head during a robbery, though she survived. And last year, in a random killing that spoke to this city’s growing unease with homelessness, a mentally disturbed transient man fatally stabbed a well-known local businesswoman on a downtown street just before noon. The violence has shaken Santa Cruz, a city of 62,000 residents, a place small enough that many know by name or face the 84 officers on the police force. “The kind of grieving that’s going on and the sense of violation that folks are feeling around this shooting is very intimate, almost familial,” said the Rev. Dave Grishaw-Jones, the senior minister of First Congregational Church. “It’s not a big city.” In churches, at City Council meetings and in the pages of The Santa Cruz Sentinel, the violence has focused heated debates on the city’s policies toward drug abuse and homelessness. Did a needle exchange program — run with little oversight, as Mayor Bryant said — draw users here from other cities? Did overly generous services for the homeless attract outsiders, many of whom can be seen camping out in the city’s parks and woods? Image Sgt. Butch Baker, who was killed while responding to a report of a sexual assault in February. Credit Santa Cruz Police Department, via Associated Press According to the Police Department’s statistics, crime has been flat in recent years, except for an increase in property theft. But about 40 percent of calls to the police involve the homeless, and the homeless make up a third of total arrests, mostly on charges of drug abuse, property crime and burglaries, said Deputy Chief Steve Clark. Regina Henderson, a neighborhood organizer who first landed here 38 years ago while following the Grateful Dead to San Francisco, said, “We draw people from all over who are very unstable, and their aggressive behavior has infiltrated our little town.” For Ms. Henderson, her view on crime changed five years ago when she stumbled upon a dead man lying along the levee near her home, a needle stuck in his arm. She formed a neighborhood watch group and joined Take Back Santa Cruz, an organization established by like-minded residents in 2009. Young families had also moved into neighborhoods, replacing longtime residents inured to the city’s social problems. “They’re not content to having a lot of dirty needles in the playgrounds,” said Lisa Rose, who has lived here since 1968. “I just shrug my shoulders and say, ‘Oh, that was unpleasant,’ when I’m accosted on the street. I’ve just grown to accept it, and maybe it shouldn’t be accepted. You know that old story about putting a frog in a pot of slowly boiling water and how it won’t jump out? That’s me.” Image Officer Elizabeth Butler was also fatally shot by the same gunman. Credit Santa Cruz Police Department, via Associated Press Take Back Santa Cruz — which has promoted the slogan “Keep Santa Cruz Safe and Clean” — quickly became an influential force in the city. One of its leaders, Pamela Comstock, was elected to the City Council in November. “We have a history of accepting unique and different behaviors, but at some point that became deviant behavior,” Ms. Comstock said, adding that the city’s open drug culture brings in both dealers and users from the outside. The city, Ms. Comstock said, should shift money and resources to programs for families and children and away from homeless services. Until a few years ago, the police felt hamstrung by a City Council and a community that, reflecting their roots from the 1960s, looked askance at authority. “For a lot of years, I felt we were seen as a necessary evil,” said Deputy Chief Clark, a 28-year veteran. “I would absolutely say that is not the current attitude of the City Council or the community. I think this community has realized what a mess we’ve made.” But other city leaders caution that in an overemotional response to the recent violence, Santa Cruz could lose what made it special in the first place. Image Jeremy Goulet, accused of shooting Sgt. Baker and Officer Butler, was later killed in a shootout with officers. Credit Santa Cruz Police Department, via Associated Press Don Lane, a city councilman who also sits on the board of two homeless organizations, said the killings of the police officers had nothing to do with the homeless. “Everybody wants to say we really need to reflect on what’s going on here and why it happened, and then very quickly they go to that issue: Is Santa Cruz too tolerant and welcoming?” he said. “Personally, I’m not sure how that connection is made.” Neal Coonerty, a former mayor and current Santa Cruz County supervisor, also rejected suggestions that the killings of the police officers reflected deeper problems in the city. “We were more the victims in this situation than we are somehow enabling the violence to happen,” he said. A decade ago, Mr. Coonerty’s family-owned business, Bookshop Santa Cruz, began selling T-shirts, mugs and bumper stickers with the slogan “Keep Santa Cruz Weird.” It was meant, he said, to counter City Council efforts to restrict street performers downtown. “Some people have interpreted that somehow it has something to do with being relaxed about drug use and violence,” he said. “It’s the furthest thing. It had to deal with street performers. But people twisted its meaning and are implying that it had something to do with the terrible events that happened.”",

    "source": "William R. Hudgins, 100, Who Led Black-Owned Banks, Dies <eos> William R. Hudgins, a former door-to-door salesman in Harlem who helped start the Carver Federal Savings Bank, now the largest black-owned bank in the nation, and was its president for 18 years, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. Mr. Hudgins, who along with Jackie Robinson later helped start the Freedom National Bank, was 100. The death was announced by his daughter, Jan Hudgins Riley. With seven other Harlem leaders, Mr. Hudgins founded what was originally known as the Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association in 1948, when blacks were facing what an article in The New York Times called “a wall of bias” in obtaining loans from major financial institutions. “There was always black homeownership and business ownership in Harlem in the ’40s, ’50s, ’60s, but the question was who provided the loan money,” Earl G. Graves Sr., the publisher of Black Enterprise Magazine, said yesterday. “It was usually family, friends, persons you knew in the church that you attended or, in the West Indian community, sou-sous, informal credit unions.” “Bill Hudgins recognized the need,” Mr. Graves said. The Carver bank, named for the botanist George Washington Carver, was started on a financial shoestring of $250,000 with $14,000 in cash and the rest in pledges from community residents. By 1962, it had lent more than $30 million to about 3,000 home buyers and maintained more than 32,000 savings accounts. Last year, with branches in Manhattan, Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn, Carver held assets of $648 million and deposits of $488 million, according to Black Enterprise Magazine. In 1966, Mr. Hudgins joined with another group of black leaders, including Mr. Robinson, who by then had retired as a baseball player, to form the Freedom National Bank. He was its president until 1971. Freedom National went out of business in 1990. William Randolph Hudgins was born in Petersburg, Va., on April 30, 1907. At the age of 2 he was adopted by William and Agnes Hudgins. His adoptive father was a carpenter and owned a delivery truck; his adoptive mother was a music teacher. A tall, thin young man, Mr. Hudgins came to Harlem in his early 20s. He first worked door to door as a Fuller Brush salesman, then took a job at a local dry-cleaning store that specialized in refurbishing costumes from Broadway shows. In 1943, he parlayed the value from several real estate investments to start Best Yet Hair Products, a mail-order business that sold high-quality wigs made from human hair. Because of his business success in the late 1940s, Mr. Hudgins became the first African-American chosen to join the merchants’ division of the Uptown Chamber of Commerce in Manhattan, now called the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Hudgins married three times. His first marriage, to the former Martha Fitzgerald, ended in divorce. His second wife, Myrtle Patterson Hudgins, died in 1972. Besides his daughter, Jan, of Manhattan, Mr. Hudgins is survived by his third wife, the former Dorothy Carroll, whom he married in 1972; a son, Alvin, of Sarasota, Fla.; eight grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. Although Freedom National Bank was less successful than the Carver bank, a Time magazine article in 1966 offered a glimpse of the mission that Mr. Hudgins envisioned for his banking enterprises. “Almost like a small-town banker, Hudgins gets personally involved in many loan applications,” the article said. “Doubtfuls usually wind up in his second-floor office to plead their cases, and frequently get their loans after careful investigation.”",

    "source": "Climbers of Times Building Get Different Jury Treatment <eos> Although they climbed the headquarters of The New York Times on the same day, June 5, Renaldo Clarke and Alain Robert ’s stunts were seen differently. Mr. Robert was something of a professional stuntman, known for climbing buildings around the world to promote the fight against global warming . He seemed to scale the building playfully. Mr. Clarke was unknown until his climb to promote the fight against malaria. He seemed to struggle at times during his ascent. Another difference: Mr. Clarke, who appeared in State Supreme Court in Manhattan for a hearing on Tuesday, was indicted on criminal charges, while Mr. Robert was not. In August, a grand jury voted to indict Mr. Clarke on three counts, the most serious of which was a misdemeanor charge of reckless endangerment, punishable by up to a year in prison. A different grand jury had voted in June to dismiss all criminal charges against Mr. Robert, leaving only a count of disorderly conduct, which is not a crime, but a violation akin to a parking ticket. The difference in the cases may come down to a simple element: Mr. Robert may have been more convincing before the grand jury than Mr. Clarke. (A third man, David Malone, who scaled several floors on July 9 before climbing down, was also indicted. After his stunt, The Times altered the building’s facade.) “It’s a little disappointing,” said Gary A. Farrell, Mr. Clarke’s lawyer. “I guess they bought the first guy’s claim that he’s Mr. Experienced Climber. There’s something to that. He’s got a documented history of doing industrial climbs and Ray Clarke doesn’t.” Mr. Clarke has said that he had climbed other buildings including the Hearst Tower, at 56th Street and Eighth Avenue, but that he had done so unnoticed and had not been arrested. He also said he had been studying blueprints of the Times Building for two years and bought $130 climbing shoes on the day of the climb. On Tuesday, Mr. Farrell told Justice Charles H. Solomon that he would seek a plea deal in which Mr. Clarke could perform community service and have his misdemeanor conviction erased from his record. Daniel J. Castleman, the chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, declined to comment on why the grand jury had voted differently in the cases. But he said, “We treated both cases similarly in that we presented it to the grand jury, and they voted differently in both cases, which is their prerogative.”",

    "source": "Wells Fargo Swoops In <eos> The bold gambit that could reorder American banking began with the chirp of a cellphone in Charlotte, N.C. It was just after 9 p.m. on Thursday, and Robert K. Steel, the chief executive of the Wachovia Corporation , listened to startling news on his phone as he stepped off a plane from New York: Wells Fargo & Company was plotting to wrest his stricken bank from Citigroup . Only four days earlier, assisted by federal regulators, Mr. Steel had agreed to sell Wachovia to Citigroup for a fire-sale $1 a share. Wells Fargo had walked away, and Richard M. Kovacevich, its chairman, had called to wish Mr. Steel good luck. But now Mr. Kovacevich was on the line with a far sweeter deal, one worth about $15 billion — seven times what Citigroup was offering. The call set in motion another game of brinkmanship in a year of extraordinary Wall Street showdowns. At stake is the control of one of the nation’s largest retail banking businesses — a prize that will transform the winner into one of the few giants to emerge from the wreckage of the industry. For Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco, Wachovia would expand its reach across the nation. Citigroup, which is based in New York, wants the bank for its large retail operations. The battle has also drawn in federal regulators, who had pushed the teetering Wachovia into the arms of Citigroup but are now seeking to limit taxpayer exposure. The reversal might make it more difficult for the government to broker future rescues. Citigroup is weighing a lawsuit that would claim a breach of contract. The cast of characters include some of the most powerful executives in the industry: Vikram S. Pandit at Citigroup; Mr. Steel, a former confidant of Henry M. Paulson Jr. at both the Treasury and Goldman Sachs; and Mr. Kovacevich, a legendary banker and former Citigroup executive who, until now, has largely shunned the empire-building practiced by his rivals. In the wings is Warren E. Buffett, the largest shareholder of Wells Fargo, who has emerged as the go-to financier for several prominent companies that have come under siege during the credit crisis . For Mr. Steel, the latest chapter began on Thursday night with the call from Mr. Kovacevich, who told him to consider the new offer or he would go public with it on Friday morning. About 10 minutes later, Mr. Steel’s BlackBerry buzzed. It was a merger proposal from Wells Fargo, bearing the approval of that bank’s board. Wachovia executives were stunned. They had not heard from Wells for days, and had been working nonstop alongside Citigroup bankers to close the deal and discuss operational details. Mr. Steel called one of his Wall Street advisers, who was at home watching the vice presidential debate . “Fasten your seat belt,” Mr. Steel told him. At about 11:30 p.m., Mr. Steel convened an emergency meeting of Wachovia’s board, where he described the new offer and a serious potential roadblock. Accepting might involve breaking an agreement with Citigroup that appeared to block a rival bid. After two hours of debate, the board concluded that Wells Fargo’s offer was too good to pass up. Wells Fargo was offering to buy all of Wachovia, whereas Citigroup had proposed buying only part of it. Also, Wells, unlike Citigroup, was not seeking government support. And then there was the money. The board voted in favor of the offer, and, at approximately 2:15 a.m., Mr. Steel placed an awkward call to Mr. Pandit at Citigroup. The deal, he told him, was off. Fifteen minutes later, Mr. Pandit alerted his lawyers and top lieutenants and summoned them to prepare for battle. They met at the law offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell. Groggy, one Citigroup executive forgot his corporate ID card. In the early hours of Friday morning, Wachovia executives learned that Sheila C. Bair, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which had pressed for the Citigroup deal, would not stand in the way of the new agreement with Wells Fargo, as it would involve no risk to taxpayers. “Neither Chairman Bair nor any person at the F.D.I.C. in any way initiated or solicited this bid from Wells Fargo,” an F.D.I.C. spokesman said on Friday. “When asked for our views, we said that we would not object” because the agency does not have the authority. Other federal regulators said that they would not block Well Fargo’s offer while they reviewed the proposal. By Friday morning the F.D.I.C. said it stood behind the original deal with Citigroup. Bankers working on the deal were mystified by the statement, and said they had assumed the government would ultimately back a deal that did not involve public money. News of the deal reached Wall Street trading desks at 7 a.m. A few hours later, Wells Fargo went public with its offer. Citigroup, its stock sinking, quickly fired back. The Wells-Wachovia deal is “in clear breach” of an exclusivity agreement between Citigroup and Wachovia, Citigroup said. Citigroup claimed it had been irreparably harmed and demanded that Wachovia and Wells Fargo halt their proposed transaction. Mr. Kovacevich told investors in a conference call Friday morning that he was confident the deal would go through. “We think this deal is solid,” he said. When an analyst asked Mr. Steel if he could discuss whether Wachovia had a binding agreement with Citigroup, he replied with one word: No. But Mr. Buffett, in an interview on CNBC, endorsed the Wells Fargo bid on Friday afternoon, calling it superior to Citigroup’s offer. Well Fargo’s reversal came after a little-noticed move on Tuesday by the Internal Revenue Service, which restored tax breaks for banks that take big losses on bad loans inherited through acquisitions. The rule had been viewed as a impediment to bank consolidation. With Wachovia, Wells Fargo estimates that it will absorb about $74 billion in losses. The marketplace passed swift judgment on Friday. As its hold on Wachovia appeared to slip away, Citigroup stumbled in the stock market. Its shares fell nearly 18.5 percent, while shares of Wells Fargo slipped just 1.7 percent. Wachovia was the big winner. Its shares soared nearly 59 percent.",

    "source": "Opel Worker Representatives Deny Reports of Plant Closings in Europe <eos> FRANKFURT — Worker representatives at General Motors ’ Opel unit said Friday there were no negotiations about closing factories in Europe, partly contradicting reports of impending shutdowns in Britain and Germany. “Speculation that local negotiations on savings are taking place is denied,” the Opel/Vauxhall European Employee Forum said. Vauxhall is the brand name G.M. uses in Britain. In Europe, no shutdowns would be possible without prior negotiations with workers. The workers group was responding to numerous press reports that Opel’s supervisory board will meet next week to consider closing factories in Bochum, Germany, and Ellesmere Port, Britain. A spokesman for Opel in Germany, Andreas Krömer, said he could not comment on the reports of factory closings. But he said, “It’s clear that Opel must achieve sustainable profitability.” A G.M. spokesman, Klaus-Peter Martin, said, “We have not announced anything. We are not commenting on speculation or speculative stories that are out there.” Whether or not G.M. is planning to close any European factories soon, there is little doubt that painful measures lie ahead. Opel was largely responsible for a $747 million loss that G.M.’s European unit reported for 2011. All of the makers of midprice cars in Europe suffer from overcapacity, and Opel’s problems are among the most acute. Karl-Friedrich Stracke, the chief executive of Opel, said earlier this month that the company’s factories were operating at only 80 percent capacity. Surplus capacity is deadly for carmakers, because they must continue to pay for upkeep and the salaries of unproductive workers. The pressure is only likely to get worse as the European economy slips into recession. Registrations of new cars in Europe were down 8.3 percent in Europe in January and February. During the same period Opel’s market share in the European Union sank to 6.1 percent from 7 percent a year earlier. Other European brands including Renault, Fiat, Peugeot and Citroën also lost ground. With the exception of Volkswagen and Ford of Europe, the midprice carmakers have been losing share to Bayerische Motoren Werke and Daimler, which are offering smaller, lower-priced models. In addition, the Hyundai-Kia alliance has been making inroads in Europe. The statement from Opel/Vauxhall workers Friday signaled the struggle that awaits G.M. as it tries to cut costs in the face of determined worker opposition. In return for earlier concessions, Opel had agreed not to close any plants or lay off any workers until at least 2014. The workers group argued that closing plants is itself expensive and will not solve Opel’s problems. Instead, the company should stop importing some vehicles from outside Europe and try harder to develop export markets for the Opel brand. “It makes little sense to speculate on expensive plant closures,” the workers group said. “Such costly closures will make sure it will take years for the company to return to profit.” Workers complain that G.M. has put more emphasis on building sales in Europe for Chevrolet brand cars made primarily in South Korea. Chevrolet increased its market share in Europe to 1.7 percent in January and February from 1.2 percent a year earlier, according to data compiled by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. The worker representatives issued a demand that G.M. management “clearly reject the public speculation and agree to hold immediate constructive internal talks in order to prevent further damage to Opel/Vauxhall.” Any actions that G.M. takes in Europe to reduce capacity would be far less severe than the cutbacks it made in North America before and during its 2009 bankruptcy. G.M. eliminated tens of thousands of jobs in the United States and closed about a dozen plants. It negotiated buyout and early-retirement offers worth up to $140,000 with the United Automobile Workers union to persuade many employees to leave voluntarily. As a result, G.M. earned $7.2 billion last year in North America, by far its most profitable region, after losing more than $70 billion in North America from 2004 through 2008. Since its bankruptcy, G.M. has been increasing production as the market has rebounded, but mostly by adding jobs and shifts at existing plants. It agreed as part of last year’s union contract negotiations to reopen a plant in Tennessee that halted operations in 2009 but otherwise has resisted restarting any shuttered plants to avoid increasing its fixed costs.

    "source": "Florist-Friendly Marketplaces Help Local Flower Shops Hang On <eos> This weekend, florists across the country will send out millions of Valentine’s Day bouquets filled with roses, carnations, tulips and other blooming symbols of love. And some will lose money on almost every single sale. The neighborhood flower store, once a retail staple, is rapidly disappearing. Nearly 40 percent of America’s floral businesses have closed since 2000, with 14,000 remaining at last count, in 2013, according to census data. The number of paid employees in the field has been cut in half. A recent market report from IBISWorld put it bluntly: “The florists industry has entered the declining stage of its life cycle.” The recession and shoppers’ changing preferences have played a role: Fresh flowers are a luxury that tends to get scrapped when money is tight. But florists say one of their biggest challenges is a behind-the-scenes margin fight that plays out every time a buyer goes online to arrange a flower delivery. If a shopper goes directly to a florist’s website, the store keeps most of the revenue from the sale. That calculation changes radically if buyers go through national merchants like 1-800-Flowers and FTD.com, or if they search for local sellers on Google and click the resulting ads, which are often placed by virtual companies with no inventory of their own. In all those cases, a big chunk of the transaction is captured by middlemen. That leaves the bricks-and-mortar merchants, to whom the orders are passed for fulfillment, typically collecting 70 percent or less of the sale price, fueling a sort of love-hate relationship with online merchants. While they can increase business for a florist, that business can come at a high price. “It’s break-even at best on the vast majority,” Bonnie Bank, the controller of Superior Florist , an 86-year-old flower shop in Manhattan, said of the orders placed with her shop by outside sellers. “The higher-dollar ones, maybe you can make a small margin.” The dilemma has also created an opening for new entrants into the online market — like BloomNation , a start-up in Santa Monica, Calif., that bills itself as an Etsy for flowers, and GotFlowers , created by a software developer who is also based in California. The industry’s current financial structure has its roots in a century-old practice. In 1910, a group of 15 American florists formed a cooperative, the Florists’ Telegraph Delivery service, to exchange orders. A customer in Denver would, for example, be able to walk into a local flower shop and arrange a delivery to a friend in Boston. The originating florist transmitted the order through the florists’ wire service and received a commission for the effort; the rest of the money was passed on to the fulfilling merchant. Two changes upended that genteel arrangement. First, technology made it easier for customers to shop with national retailers offering a standardized product catalog, a trend that the Internet rapidly accelerated. And around the same time, the wire services began competing more directly with their merchants to capture incoming sales. In 1994, the members of FTD, which had by then been renamed Florists’ Transworld Delivery, privatized their co-op and sold it to an investment fund for $150 million . In a typical wire service transaction today, the originating merchant receives 20 percent of the sale price, and the wire service — FTD, 1-800-Flowers and Teleflora are the industry’s big three — keeps 7 percent. If an order comes in directly through a wire’s website, the service keeps the full 27 percent. Amplifying the problem for merchants is the rise of “order gatherers” that create elaborate virtual storefronts and advertise extensively on search engines. Their aim is to capture the 20 percent commission, plus service and delivery fees. The flower shops that receive those orders through their wire services say they are stuck with low-price, low-margin orders, and consumer websites are filled with scathing reviews from customers complaining about how little the delivered flowers look like the photos they saw. “It’s really deceptive,” said Mike Fiannaca, the president of Sparks Florist in Nevada, who created a YouTube video that demonstrates how order gatherers use his store’s name in their ad links. “We want to give all our customers the best possible value, and the experience with these sites is often terrible.” Irked by misleading orders and the wire services’ fees, Rhoda Paurus, the owner of St. Cloud Floral in Minnesota, is considering dropping both of her services, FTD and Teleflora. She took the first step toward separation in May, when she switched her website’s e-commerce system from Teleflora’s to one run by BloomNation. BloomNation charges a flat 10 percent fee on the orders it processes, and it does not have a standardized product catalog. Merchants take and post photos of their own arrangements. Image Work orders are pasted on the wall in St. Cloud Floral in St. Cloud, Minn. Credit Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times That part particularly delights Ms. Paurus, who changes her photos daily. “If we get a double shipment of roses, within a few minutes, we can have a rose special on our website,” she said. BloomNation’s executives say 1,500 shops are using their marketplace. Farbod Shoraka, one of the founders, began working on the concept five years ago after hearing from his aunt, a florist, about her business’s many pain points. “The consumer was frustrated, the business owner was frustrated, and the middleman was making all the money,” Mr. Shoraka said. “It was a very clearly broken model, from a business standpoint.” So why do florists stick with it? Some of them say they value the sales volume that the wire services bring in and have found ways to make the orders profitable. Others point to the industry’s reliance on the vendors it has worked with for decades. “A lot of florists still rely on the wire services to send their outgoing orders, including many florists we have worked with for years and years,” Ms. Bank said. “Although we try to talk them into paying us directly, many are resistant. That’s why we will likely continue with Teleflora, to maintain those relationships.” The wire services say they play a vital role in marketing florists’ goods. “I truly believe, in my heart of hearts, that if it weren’t for people and organizations like ours, there would be no retail flower shops left,” said Mark Nance, president of the 1-800-Flowers wire service BloomNet . “The retail shop can’t compete on a worldwide scale. We’re doing everything we can for those shops so they won’t be displaced by something like Amazon.” FTD noted that many florists gain new local customers from orders originated by FTD, and Teleflora said its fees were “in line with the standards needed to successfully promote consumer awareness and orders in a competitive marketplace.” Chris Drummond, a third-generation florist and the president of Plaza Flowers in Philadelphia and Norristown, Pa., agrees with that view. He advertises aggressively through a variety of channels, including online campaigns, search engine ads, direct mail, fliers and promotional deliveries to potential business clients. “We run analytics to quantify what it costs to acquire an order,” he said. “My cost across all of the platforms usually ranges from 24 to 30 percent. In the end, no matter what I use, I have to figure out how to make money on about 73 percent of the sale.” But as their industry shrinks, some flower shop owners are stepping up their efforts to change the way it operates. Real Local Florists , an advocacy group, began working several years ago with Sundaram Natarajan, a software developer,on an e-commerce system for florists’ websites that would offer a less expensive alternative to the wire services’ systems. Mr. Natarajan’s software, GotFlowers, is now used by 50 shops nationwide. Recently the group requested a new feature, now in development, and it is one that sounds rather familiar. “We had the idea that we wanted to create our own florist-to-florist network,” said Mr. Fiannaca, one of the group’s founders. “I can send an order to a member florist, and his or her products would populate on my web page.” So a century later, Real Local Florists is essentially working to recreate the kind of co-op that FTD pioneered. When asked about the similarity, Mr. Fiannaca laughed. “It’s a good model,” he said. “It just has to be one that helps keep local florists in business.”",

    "source": "Virgin Mobile Wants to Be a Friendlier Cellphone Brand <eos> DECLARATIONS of love for cellphone companies are few and far between. Dropped calls, rising prices, spotty service and strict contracts make many customers want to throw their hands — and their phones — in the air. Virgin Mobile is hoping to tackle that antipathy head-on with an advertising campaign that starts this week. Allon Tatarka, a creative director at Mother New York, the agency that created the campaign, said many people’s relationships with carriers ranged from lukewarm to vitriolic. “You either don’t care or you hate them,” Mr. Tatarka said. “We’re trying to inject love into that relationship.” Virgin Mobile isn’t a full cellphone company. Instead it’s a brand that offers prepaid cellphones through Sprint in the United States. It hopes to solidify its position with its target market, 18- to 24-year-olds, with a campaign that includes a heavy dose of youth marketing strategies from social media sites like Pinterest and Facebook, as well as mobile applications. Ron Faris, the head of brand marketing for Virgin Mobile USA, said the campaign would “tap into the Zuckerberg in all of us,” a reference to Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. Banner ads will run on sites like YouTube, Gawker, Buzzfeed and Pandora and television ads will be broadcast on ABC, NBC and Fox during shows like “Modern Family,” “Jimmy Kimmel Live” and “America’s Next Top Model.” “We’re going to change the relationship you have with your cellphone company,” Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group, says in an online video manifesto for the campaign. “We answer to a higher calling,” he adds, underscoring the tagline for the entire campaign.  Mr. Branson is the central character in the campaign’s television ad. “Long before Richard Branson created airlines and spaceships, he envisioned Virgin Mobile,” says the narrator in the ad, which shows Mr. Branson growing up in 1960s London. Robert Passikoff, the president of Brand Keys in New York, a brand and customer-loyalty consulting company, played down Mr. Branson’s celebrity role and said cellphone shoppers were looking for brand reputation, technological leadership and connectivity. The campaign is also emphasizing Virgin’s data services. “Everything has been commoditized to price,” Mr. Faris said. Those in the target audience “don’t need thousands of minutes, they need a ton of data,” he said. After AT&T announced it would no longer offer users unlimited data, the timing could be opportune for Virgin to highlight its $35-a-month unlimited data plan. “Voice talk just isn’t the norm anymore,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. “This is the Facebook generation that cut its teeth on posting updates to a Web site as a way of communicating.” Creating content for those cellphones is also a big part of the campaign. Virgin worked with Buzzfeed to create content published via social media sites like Tumblr, Facebook and Pinterest and the newly revamped VirginMobileLive.com . “It’s a decision we’re making to move closer to newsroom marketing.” Mr. Faris said. “We want to be a voice where pop culture meets technology.” To hone their editorial skills, Virgin Mobile employees will be trained by the creative services team at Buzzfeed in how to spot news and create content for the sites. “Brands have not yet figured out how to do real-time advertising or real-time content,” said Jonah Peretti, founder and chief executive of Buzzfeed. “They tend to do things with huge lead time.” Spotting and publishing an item about the latest cat video craze or celebrity gossip needs to happen quickly. “It’s not how to make branded content for advertising, it’s showing them how to make really interesting engaging content for their audience,” Mr. Peretti said. Virgin Mobile will also feature weekly profiles of apps to help developers gain exposure. The company will reveal its first app profile at the South by Southwest conference on Friday. A network of 25 technology bloggers, called the VM 25, will help the company promote its contests and other announcements. “We want to be a more hyperaddicted version of your friend on Facebook who you share stuff with,” Mr. Faris said.  Virgin Mobile is not alone in this prepaid market. Companies like MetroPCS have similar offerings for voice and data plans. But Virgin Mobile’s biggest rival is T-Mobile, Mr. Passikoff said. “Basically it’s Sprint going after T-Mobile,” he said. (Virgin Mobile is owned by Sprint in the United States.) Virgin Mobile has not been shy about its disdain for its rival. Carly, the T-Mobile spokeswoman who wears a pink dress while standing against a stark white background, was once a play on ads for Apple’s Mac. Now, in a Virgin Mobile ad, she is parodied as being devoid of cool and is denied entry to a nightclub because of her pink dress. Virgin Mobile did not share the cost of the campaign, only to say the company tended “to spend somewhere between 3 percent and 5 percent of what our competitors spend on paid media.” According to data from Kantar Media, part of WPP, Virgin Mobile spent $20.1 million on advertising from January to September 2010 and $47.4 million for the same period in 2011. T-Mobile spent $425.1 million on advertising from January to September 2011 and MetroPCS spent $85.2 million in the same period.",

    "source": "ISIS Close to Recapturing Palmyra From Syrian Forces <eos> BEIRUT, Lebanon — Islamic State fighters appeared close to retaking Palmyra, Syria, on Saturday, just nine months after Syrian government forces drove them from the desert city, where they had terrorized residents and blown up irreplaceable ancient monuments. Residents said Islamic State militants were battling soldiers in the city’s center, after retaking outlying oil fields and nearly encircling the city over the past week as the government and its allies were focused on a pivotal battle in Aleppo, further north. Losing Palmyra for a second time would be a major symbolic and military blow for the Syrian government, which touted its reconquest of the city in March, after 10 months of Islamic State rule. Russia, the government’s main ally, which had helped with air support and advisers, flew an orchestra to play a victory concert in Palmyra’s ancient amphitheater that month. The Russians also established a small base in the city, but residents said all Russian troops had pulled out in recent days as the militants approached. The setback in Palmyra comes as the government has been scoring its most important victories in years in Aleppo, once Syria’s largest city. The army and allied militias there have retaken most of the eastern half of the city. East Aleppo has been held for four years by rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. Another battle, also unfolding on Saturday, may further complicate the government’s war strategy. A rebel coalition backed by Turkey made advances against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, in the city of Al Bab in northern Aleppo Province, an area that the Syrian government hoped to conquer from the group. Residents were in a state of fear and anxiety, according to activists from the Local Coordination Committee of Palmyra, a group that opposes both Mr. Assad’s government and the Islamic State’s self-described caliphate. The activist group said that residents were being abandoned by government forces, which had withdrawn from several areas. The events echoed those of spring 2015, when most government forces left the area, leaving residents and a few junior soldiers at the hands of the Islamic State. Many of those who remained were executed . On Saturday, pro-government social media accounts reported that Russian advisers and other “allies” — possibly including militiamen from Iraq and the Lebanese group Hezbollah — had abandoned Palmyra as the Islamic State approached, leaving Syrian government troops to fend for themselves. Hezbollah played a major role in the battle to take back Palmyra nine months ago, a victory it sought to publicize in order to show that it, too, was battling terrorism and saving the ancient ruins from further destruction. On Thursday, 34 Syrian soldiers were reported killed in an Islamic State bombing at a location on the outskirts of Palmyra known as the Qatari castle. The Islamic State’s advance came as state news media broadcast statements about the government’s victory in East Aleppo. State television has painted a rosy picture, suggesting that reconstruction work in Aleppo could soon begin and some of the five million refugees outside Syria could start returning home. Mr. Assad, however, called the Aleppo siege a major victory, but said it would not end the war.",

    "source": "4 Killed in Bus Bombings in Karachi, Pakistan <eos> ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — At least four people were killed in the southern port city of Karachi on Tuesday in bombings that struck two buses carrying Pakistani naval employees, a senior naval official said. At least 56 people were wounded. The official, Commodore Irfan ul-Haq, identified the dead as a civilian doctor, a junior naval officer, and two low-ranking naval employees. No one claimed responsibility immediately, but Taliban insurgents and militant groups affiliated with the organization have repeatedly attacked civilians and military installations across the country. Karachi is the country’s largest city and considered the financial and commercial capital. Both bombs struck during the early morning rush. The first was planted on a motorcycle that was idling by a main road in an upscale neighborhood, the police said; it exploded as the naval bus passed. The blast destroyed the bus, killing the junior naval officer and the doctor and wounding 37 other passengers. The windows of nearby houses were shattered. Minutes later, in a relatively impoverished neighborhood, a remote-controlled bomb hidden in roadside rubble exploded, the police said. That blast killed the two other naval employees and injured 19 others. On Saturday, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the army chief, claimed to in a speech before Afghan military cadets to have broken the back of militants in the country. The bombings were “a powerful message by the militants,” said Omar R. Quraishi, opinion pages editor of The Express Tribune, an English-language daily newspaper based in Karachi. “The message is that we may be on the run, but we can strike at will and choose targets of our choosing.”",

    "source": "Bruins Coach Eschews Negativity and Builds Winners <eos> BOSTON — On the first Monday of April 2007, the Devils had a 47-24-8 record. They were in first place in the Atlantic Division with the second-best record in the Eastern Conference. They had won four of their past five games and appeared well positioned for a deep playoff run. That’s what their coach thought. As Claude Julien prepared for a late-morning meeting with his boss, the Devils’ president, Lou Lamoriello, he had playoffs on his mind. How would the Devils deal with certain personnel issues? What kind of travel contingencies did they need to address? Julien knew the ever-meticulous Lamoriello liked to have all his bases covered. What Julien did not know, nor could he reasonably have been expected to know, was that April 2, 2007, would be his last day as the coach of the Devils. Lamoriello abruptly fired Julien, saying he thought the team, despite its record, was nowhere near being ready for the playoffs. There were three games remaining in the regular season. The stunned coach called his wife, Karen, from his car on the way home. She noted the time and said she thought he was coming home unusually early. He told her the news. Not far away, many of his former players gathered for lunch, just as stunned. Zach Parise sent Julien a text message offering his best wishes. Julien also heard from the backup goalie Scott Clemmensen, who appeared in just six games that season. Jay Pandolfo, who later played briefly for Julien in Boston, said: “The whole thing was definitely crazy. With three games left?” The encouraging words cheered Julien as he tried to digest what had just happened. Almost 15 months earlier, he had been fired as the coach of the Montreal Canadiens, his first N.H.L. coaching job, after three seasons. His second opportunity did not even last one full season. He was three weeks shy of his 47th birthday and asked himself, “How do I ever recover from this?” “I never saw either one of them coming,” Julien said of the dismissals. “Maybe I’m naïve, but I never did. And after the second firing, I was worried that it would take away any opportunity I might ever have to get back into the N.H.L.” He added: “That’s why this thing in Boston has been the best thing that could have ever happened to me. I feel like an established coach now in the N.H.L. It’s a good fit, and it has overshadowed the negative things from back then.” This “thing” in Boston is now ending its seventh year, as Julien, coaching the Bruins, leads them into the Stanley Cup playoffs with the league’s best record. He has a Stanley Cup ring from the Bruins’ championship in 2011 and an Olympic gold medal from Sochi as an assistant for Team Canada. He is now third in the N.H.L. in years of consecutive service with one team. The Devils have gone through four coaches since Julien was dismissed, not counting Lamoriello, who finished the 2006-7 season. The team he thought needed a playoff jolt with a new coach? It was eliminated in the second round. Less than three months later, in June 2007, Julien was announced as the coach of the Bruins. The man who hired him, General Manager Peter Chiarelli, had tried to give him the job the year before. Had he called Julien an hour sooner, Julien would have come to Boston a year earlier and the stint with the Devils would never have happened. Chiarelli and Julien had been friends for years, both growing up in the greater Ottawa area. In the spring of 2006, Chiarelli was still technically with Ottawa but had accepted the job as Boston’s general manager. He had to go through league channels to receive permission to speak to Julien, and by the time the two connected, Julien had just agreed to coach the Devils. One more year was not going to change Chiarelli’s mind, especially since there was a pervasive feeling that Lamoriello had been a micromanager, drawing on the success he had in 2000 when he fired Coach Robbie Ftorek with eight games left and the Devils went on to win the Cup. As the former Devils wing Jamie Langenbrunner put it when asked if the players had been surprised by Julien’s firing: “We were surprised. Some of us were shocked. But in New Jersey, you learn not to be surprised by anything to do with coaches.” Chiarelli said he received some criticism after the Julien hiring, adding, “That was fair, especially after he was let go twice in a short period of time.” “But I felt he learned a lot from the two jobs,” he said. “And I believed in him.” Julien was appreciative. “It was nice to see that, no matter what happened to me, there were still people who believed I could do the job,” he said, “and Peter was one of those guys.” Here is what else Julien, 53, could point to as a counterbalance to the firings: His teams win. His Montreal teams won 72 and lost 65, with 15 overtime losses and 10 ties. His first full season at Montreal resulted in 93 points and a first-round upset of the Bruins after trailing in the series, 3-1. His final Montreal team was in third place with a winning record when he was fired in January 2006. The Devils had 102 points when he was released. Only once, when he first joined the Canadiens in midseason, has Julien not had a winning record. This year’s Bruins team, with 117 points, might be his best. “That’s what his teams do, they win,” said Jim Dowd, who played for Julien in Montreal and with the Devils. Julien often harks back to his days as a roofer in the family business as a character-building experience. He started when he was 14. He kept doing it while he bounced around the minor leagues and during the summer in the brief time (14 games) he played in the N.H.L. for the Quebec Nordiques. He even kept at it when he got his first real coaching job with the Hull Olympiques in 1994. “I’d drive the truck to the arena, take a shower to get the tar smell off of me and hop on the bus,” he said. “Roofing is probably one of the main reasons that I am what I am today. It is a real tough job and built the character I needed to do this job.” Julien carries that attitude with him today just as surely as he carted shingles up ladders, raised pails of stones on a pulley and spread the pungent tar. The work was honest and humble, traits he instills in, and expects from, his players. “I want our guys’ actions to speak instead of their words, to make them see that they are one of the fortunate ones to make it to this level,” he said. Seven years after hitting the professional bottom, and wondering how he would ever manage to recover, Julien has found a comfort level in Boston he once thought might be unattainable. “I think I’ve found a niche here,” he said. “I like the whole picture, from upper management to who I work with.” Chiarelli said he and Julien had discussed many possible situations and contingencies for the playoffs. None involved replacing the successful coach. “He was at the top of my list when I got the Boston job,” Chiarelli said. And he is still there.",

    "source": "Insurer Charged With Theft From a Charity <eos> The owner of a Long Island insurance company has been charged with helping a longtime Jewish community leader loot more than $7 million from one of the city’s most influential social service organizations and pocketing at least $1 million himself, according to a criminal complaint filed in the case. The insurance company owner, Joseph Ross, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with first-degree grand larceny and money laundering and other crimes for what the complaint said was his admitted role in the scheme, which spanned two decades and targeted the social service organization, the Metropolitan New York Council on Jewish Poverty. The community leader, William E. Rapfogel, who served as the group’s executive director until the scheme was uncovered this summer and he was fired in August, was arrested on similar charges in September. The arrests are the result of an ongoing investigation by the offices of the state’s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, and the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli. The insurance company, Century Coverage in Valley Stream, N.Y., has provided its services to the organization, known as Met Council, for more than two decades. Mr. Ross, 58, was arrested on Wednesday and arraigned before Acting State Supreme Court Justice Abraham Clott. He did not enter a plea and was released on his own recognizance. Mr. Ross’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, would not comment on the accusations. “I don’t think it’s appropriate to discuss the substantive facts at this time, but Mr. Ross intends to address these issues in a very responsible fashion,” Mr. Brafman said. The charges contained in the Sept. 24 complaint against Mr. Rapfogel and the one charging Mr. Ross are similar, as are the outlines of the scheme detailed in the two documents. Century sent Met Council inflated invoices and the two men and another conspirator split the excess money, according to the complaints. It appears that investigators have concluded that the amount of money stolen between the early 1990s and August 2013 was greater than they had believed. In the complaint charging Mr. Rapfogel, the total amount of the theft was listed as in excess of $5 million. But the complaint against Mr. Ross says the total amount of money stolen was in excess of $7 million. The complaint against Mr. Ross, which was sworn out by Gerard Matheson, an investigator with the attorney general’s office, said that Mr. Rapfogel used some of the stolen money to provide political contributions to candidates for city, state and federal offices in the names of Century owners and employees. It said that Mr. Rapfogel instructed Mr. Ross to make contributions to various candidates and political organizations, and that Mr. Ross regularly delivered checks for the contributions to Mr. Rapfogel. The complaint said that more than $120,000 was provided to candidates for city offices, and tens of thousands of dollars more went to candidates for state and federal offices. Met Council, a nonprofit organization that receives tens of millions of dollars in city, state and federal financing, cannot legally make such contributions itself.",

    "source": "Struggling Mets Stand Up to an Ace <eos> As Zack Greinke took the mound for the Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday night, he did not look especially intimidating. He was not particularly tall. He was not overly muscular. His face looked boyish as he paced around the mound, kicked at the dirt, toed the rubber and stared down the first batter. But he was probably the last pitcher the Mets wanted to see. They had lost six of their last seven games, and Greinke had gone 21 consecutive starts allowing two earned runs or fewer, tying the modern record. The Mets could be excused if Greinke rolled over them, too. Instead, they stayed patient and got to Greinke for three runs, chasing him after five innings. Up and down the order, they showed moxie. Jon Niese pitched seven strong innings. David Wright and Curtis Granderson each had two hits. Juan Lagares drove in the decisive run. Eric Campbell made a diving catch. With the 5-3 victory at Citi Field, the Mets improved to 21-25 and salvaged some confidence. Mets Manager Terry Collins, hoping for a spark, had started three young players: Campbell, 27, in left field; Lagares, 25, in center; and Wilmer Flores, 22, at shortstop. Maybe Greinke would not intimidate them. Campbell, in particular, had seemed unfazed since he was called up about two weeks ago. In seven games, he had batted .438 and had driven in five runs, hitting his first career home run Wednesday. Before the game, Collins said he was riding the “hot horse” by giving Campbell his first major league start in left. “I’m just kind of taking a shot in the dark,” Collins said. Campbell helped. In the second inning, after Granderson doubled and went to third on an error by Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp, Campbell drove him in with a sacrifice fly. Two batters later, with one out and a runner on first base, Flores sent a high fly ball to right-center. It appeared to be an extra-base hit, one that would easily score Lucas Duda, who was on first. But the Dodgers’ Yasiel Puig broke into a full-out sprint, flung his body like a torpedo toward the ball and caught it backhanded at the last moment. “That was about a good a catch as I’ve ever seen,” Collins said. Greinke smiled as he retook the mound. The Mets had figured him out, to some degree, but he had faced similar situations over his previous 21 games. “He’s just consistent,” Dodgers Manager Don Mattingly said before the game. “His preparation; who he is. His stuff is pretty consistent. There are days, though, that he’s not as good as others, and he still knows what he’s doing enough to get through it.” Undaunted, the Mets got to Greinke again in the fifth inning. Anthony Recker doubled, and Niese doubled him home. Then Niese scored, too, as third baseman Justin Turner, a former Met, failed to cleanly field a ground ball off the bat of Daniel Murphy. After the inning, as Greinke walked off, he chatted with his catcher, A. J. Ellis. The Mets had worked him for three runs but only one earned run, meaning his streak was still intact and, at 22 games, was the longest such run in the majors since at least 1914. Recker was again in the Mets’ lineup as their regular catcher, Travis d’Arnaud, sat out with a concussion. Before the game, nine days after he was hit by a backswing, d’Arnaud said he had been cleared for baseball activities. He revealed that this was his third concussion and that he wanted to switch his catcher’s helmet from a hockey-style mask to a more traditional skullcap-and-face-mask combination. This concussion, he said, felt like the others. His timetable to return, however, remained unclear. “It was just one of those things,” he said. “What can you do?” Recker did a fine job navigating Niese through the Dodgers’ order at the start. After allowing a run in the first inning, he gave up only one hit over the next five innings. Niese cruised until Turner hit a fastball to left for a game-tying, two-run homer in the seventh. Niese put his hands on his hips and shook his head. “He’s welcome for that one,” Niese said. Still undeterred, the three youngsters in the Mets’ lineup essentially won them the game. Flores singled to lead off the seventh, Lagares singled him in for a 4-3 lead, and Campbell made a diving catch in the eighth to start a double play that ended the inning. The fans’ cheers on that play sounded delayed, as if they wanted to make sure Campbell had actually made the catch. The whole game had been somewhat hard to believe.",

    "source": "After a Job Loss, Living Without Power or Prescriptions <eos> It came down to living by candlelight. When Ivonne Diaz went through her monthly bills last year to see which ones she could afford on her unemployment checks, she realized she would have to go without electricity. Having Con Edison turn off her lights is just one more obstacle she has faced since losing her job in December 2010. She has also juggled payments for rent and grocery bills while supporting her pregnant teenage daughter. “Well, we can deal with candles,” reasoned Ms. Diaz, 51, a single mother of two and a grandmother of three. So for about two weeks, she and her daughter Marisol Diaz, 18, spent their nights in flickering darkness in their one-bedroom apartment in south Yonkers. Ms. Diaz said the hardest part of having the power cut off was “not knowing when I was going to get it put back on.” Such uncertainty has overshadowed her life ever since she lost her job at the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation, where she had worked since 1986, eventually becoming a branch office manager. “I grew up in this company,” she said. “It was all I knew.” But that December, the roughly 1,000 employees in the city’s off-track betting parlors received grim news: The operation was shutting down . “What a feeling of being lost that was,” Ms. Diaz said. Having worked for 24 years and 4 months, Ms. Diaz fell just short of the 25-year minimum required to collect a pension, she said. The loss of her job meant an end to health insurance for her and Marisol, who has a learning disability and is six months pregnant. It also meant that Ms. Diaz went without her prescription drugs. “From April to September, I had no blood pressure medicine,” Ms. Diaz said. “I said, O.K., God, I won’t eat things with salt,” she recalled. “I’ll walk a little more; I’ll take off some weight. But I felt sick. “Let me tell you, that’s the worst: to be on medication and not know where you were going to get it.” Ms. Diaz had earned $77,000 a year as a branch office manager, but she ran through her savings and had to tap into money she had socked away, like cashing in her 457 deferred-compensation plan. But she was disappointed to learn that she had to pay taxes on that money, which left her with significantly less than she had hoped for. “You can avoid going to the dentist, but you can’t avoid taxes,” she said. With six months left until her $402-a-week unemployment benefits run out, Ms. Diaz worries about finding a job and fears she does not have the computer skills to compete with younger applicants because she had done her work entirely on paper at the betting parlor. “In the back office, everything was done by hand,” she said, “so we never had to use a computer or even type.” Ms. Diaz got her security officer’s license and attended computer classes at the Riverfront Library in Yonkers, and then a former co-worker told her about the Grace Institute . The institute was founded in 1897 as a tuition-free educational and vocational training program for disadvantaged women. It offers classes in areas like typing, writing and computer programs, and helps prepare students for a competitive job market. Ms. Diaz began the program in September and described her first days there as “very scary,” but she quickly formed a bond with her classmates. “It’s even like we’re another family there,” she said. She has come a long way. “I’m so impressed with myself that I can actually type,” she said, beaming. “And now I’m sitting next to girls in my class that can’t type as well as I can,” she added playfully. But one day, Ms. Diaz was commuting to the East Side of Manhattan for her classes when she realized she did not have the subway fare to take the No. 1 train to get home later. “It broke my heart to have to go ask someone to help me,” Ms. Diaz said. But she turned to Lauren Silberstein, a social worker at Grace Institute, an affiliate of Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York . “When she entered my office, she just started crying,” Ms. Silberstein said. “We talked for a while about her situation and her finances.” Ms. Diaz’s rent is $1,200 a month, and she paid about $600 a month for utilities and other expenses, but had fallen behind on her electric bill. Ms. Silberstein gave her a MetroCard and a list of food pantries in the neighborhood. “Then I told her about The New York Times Neediest Cases project,” she said. Ms. Diaz contacted Catholic Charities, one of the seven agencies supported by the Neediest Cases Fund, and in November, she was given $310 from the fund to help pay her electric bill. Buoyed by the confidence the Grace Institute has given her, Ms. Diaz is eager for her first job interviews when she completes the program in March. Now, when her daughter worries, Ms. Diaz said, “I reassure her that we will all be O.K.” “There is a light at the end of the tunnel,” she says.",

    "source": "With Hospitals Under Stress, Tennessee’s Governor Pursues Medicaid Expansion <eos> WASHINGTON — Under mounting pressure from financially strapped hospitals, Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee proposed on Monday an alternative plan for expanding Medicaid that he said would bring health coverage to tens of thousands more poor residents of his state without following traditional Medicaid rules. Mr. Haslam, a Republican, made clear that he still opposed President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, which encourages states to expand Medicaid to everyone earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or $16,105 for a single person. Nonetheless, he proposed using federal Medicaid funds available under the law to cover some 200,000 low-income residents through their employer’s health insurance plan or the state’s Medicaid program. Under the second option, some people would be charged co-payments that are not always required by Medicaid, along with premiums that are rarely required. But they could receive help paying those costs “by making healthy choices,” Mr. Haslam said in a news conference in Nashville, such as by getting preventive screenings. Mr. Haslam said the Obama administration had informally agreed to the plan last week after months of negotiations. But it still needs an official federal waiver and the approval of the Republican-controlled Legislature — a potentially steep hurdle in a state where many lawmakers are aligned with the Tea Party and where opposition to Medicaid expansion has been strong. Mr. Haslam said he would call a special session in January for lawmakers to consider the plan, adding, “I believe something this important to Tennesseans should have a full discussion and its own focus.” Katie Hill, a spokeswoman for the federal Department of Health and Human Services, said it had had “productive discussions with Governor Haslam, and we look forward to the state submitting its plan.” Ron Ramsey, a Republican who is the state’s lieutenant governor and Senate speaker, and who in the past has adamantly opposed Medicaid expansion, suggested in a statement that he was open to the plan. “Governor Haslam has negotiated a deal which returns tax dollars back to Tennessee while using conservative principles to bring health insurance to more Tennesseans,” Mr. Ramsey said. The state’s two United States senators, Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker, both Republicans, also issued supportive statements. If Mr. Haslam’s plan receives the approval it needs, Tennessee will join 27 states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, including nine with Republican leadership. Several other Republican governors have pushed for alternative forms of Medicaid expansion in their states since the November elections, partly a reflection of how badly hospitals and local communities want the federal funds that come with it. “We now have several hospitals that have closed, and all the hospitals in the state are hurting to some extent,” said Michele Johnson, the executive director of the Tennessee Justice Center, an advocacy group. “It’s creating more and more pressure, especially in some of those really rural, far-right Tea Party districts, to understand this in a different way.” The tide may also be shifting in states like Utah and Wyoming, where Republican governors proposed their own versions of Medicaid expansion this fall, and in Idaho, where a group formed by Gov. C. L. (Butch) Otter is revising an expansion plan in hopes of winning legislative backing. The conservative governors of North Carolina and, most recently, Alabama, have expressed openness to expanding Medicaid programs if they can fashion their own approach. In perhaps the most unusual part of Mr. Haslam’s plan, the Tennessee Hospital Association has agreed to pay expansion costs beyond what the federal government covers. The Affordable Care Act calls for the federal government to cover all costs through 2016, with a gradually decreasing share thereafter, though never less than 90 percent. Mr. Haslam described his proposal as a two-year pilot program that would need reauthorization. Ms. Johnson said that some of the nation’s largest for-profit hospital chains, including Hospital Corporation of America and Community Health Systems, have headquarters in Tennessee and have watched the amount they spend on uncompensated care drop this year in states that expanded Medicaid while it has risen in states like Tennessee. “When they run the numbers, it’s dramatic,” she said.",

    "source": "Police Officer Is Charged in Shooting of Texas Man <eos> HOUSTON — A Harris County grand jury indicted a police sergeant Monday in the shooting of a young man outside his home on New Year’s Eve . The case has attracted widespread attention because the victim’s family accused the police of racial profiling. Sgt. Jeffrey Cotton, a 39-year-old veteran in the Bellaire Police Department, was charged with aggravated assault by a public servant in the shooting of Robert Tolan, a 23-year-old waiter. The sergeant is white, and Mr. Tolan is black. Mr. Tolan, who was shot in his driveway while his parents looked on, survived, though a bullet pierced his right lung and lodged in his liver. Just before the shooting, Sergeant Cotton and another officer had forced Mr. Tolan and his cousin to lie face down on the ground at gunpoint after they had gotten out of their car. The officers believed the car had been stolen, but it turned out to belong to Mr. Tolan, who is the son of Bobby Tolan , a former major league baseball player, and aspires to be a baseball player. “The Tolans are the only African-American family on the block,” said a lawyer for the family, Geoffrey Berg. “Bellaire engages in racial profiling, and this is the logical result of that policy.” The Bellaire city manager, Bernie Satterwhite, rejected that assertion. “There is nothing about the indictment or any investigation which even suggests that race played any role in the stop or Sergeant Cotton’s actions when he arrived as a backup officer,” Mr. Satterwhite said, reading a prepared statement . David Donahue, a member of Sergeant Cotton’s legal team, said the officer had fired only after Mr. Tolan leaped up and attacked him. “He felt he was in immediate danger,” he said. As the Tolan family recounts the story, Mr. Tolan and his cousin obeyed an order from the first officer on the scene, John Edwards, to lay on the ground. As Sergeant Cotton arrived in a second patrol car, Bobby Tolan and his wife, Marion, came out of the house in their pajamas. Mrs. Tolan tried to tell Sergeant Cotton that the police had made a mistake — that it was her son’s car, Mr. Berg said. The sergeant grabbed her by the arm and threw her against a garage door, the family says. As Robbie Tolan tried to rise to defend his mother, Sergeant Cotton fired at least three times, hitting him once in the chest, Mr. Berg said.",

    "source": "Dropbox Aims to Solidify Its Place With Businesses <eos> SAN FRANCISCO — Perhaps it should not have surprised corporate information technology departments that employees would use Dropbox, a service for easily sharing files among different devices by storing them in “the cloud.” But that did not mean they loved the idea of confidential files on a service they could not control. Now Dropbox is trying to appease them by selling a service for businesses, Dropbox for Teams, introduced Thursday. Add Dropbox to the list of consumer technologies that have infiltrated the workplace , like iPhones, Gmail and Skype. “With the ability of people to get what they want to get done with stuff they pay for themselves, the whole role of I.T. changes,” said Ted Schadler, a workplace analyst at Forrester Research. Still, the service has a way to go before large companies adopt it, Mr. Schadler said, “because it doesn’t have as much security and administration as they want.” For Dropbox, one of the darlings of Silicon Valley with a reported $4 billion valuation from venture capitalists, its new service is a bid to buy paying customers and solidify its foothold in the growing file-sharing business .. It is competing with big companies like Google, Apple and Amazon.com, which offer increasingly sophisticated ways to store, share and sync files, and smaller ones like Box.net, YouSendIt and SugarSync. This month, Citrix Systems bought ShareFile and Research in Motion bought NewBay, both cloud storage services. Dropbox allows people to access files, like documents, photos and music, on any device wherever they are, without pesky zip files or hulking e-mail attachments. As people edit files, Dropbox updates them so a single file is available on all devices. Most people use it free and can pay for additional storage. Dropbox, which started in 2007, has 45 million users who save more than two billion files each week. But it has scared some people, too. In June, a security breach left Dropbox accounts accessible for several hours, and a complaint filed with the Federal Trade Commission says Dropbox misled users about privacy. Dropbox says it uses the same security measures as banks. Files are encrypted and Dropbox restricts its employees’ access to files. But security is only as good as a user’s password. Dropbox said it is working on two-step authentication, so people would enter a second password sent to their phone, for instance. “These are all things we take very, very seriously because our reputation and the confidence and trust people have in Dropbox is what we’ll succeed by,” said ChenLi Wang, team leader for business and sales. Millions already sign up with their work e-mail addresses and the company estimates that at least a million businesses use the service. Dropbox for Teams, which starts at $795 annually for five users, has 1,000 gigabytes of storage and phone customer support, and gives I.T. departments control over adding and removing users. SusieCakes, a California bakery chain, has been testing Dropbox for Teams to share petty cash reports in real time and to exchange documents with outside lawyers. The service is easier to use than options like Microsoft’s file-sharing service, called Windows Live SkyDrive, said Houston Striggow, SusieCakes’ co-founder. “It’s really proven for us to be a powerful business tool that’s made us a lot more efficient and productive,” he said. But Mr. Schadler, the analyst, said that before it would get widespread business adoption, Dropbox needed features like security controls to automatically stop people from sharing confidential documents. Dropbox says it is working on new features, including extra security measures and collaboration tools. Of Dropbox’s competitors, Box.net has made the most headway in businesses, Mr. Schadler said. Google is also going after businesses with tools like Google Docs, which lets employees collaborate on the same version of a document, and Chromebooks, laptops that store everything online so people can access it from any computer. Sujay Jaswa, Dropbox’s vice president of business development and sales, said its service had an advantage over big companies because it enabled iPads, Android phones and PCs to work together. “You need a company like us that doesn’t have a horse in the race to be there for consumers,” he said.",

    "source": "Bitly Helps the Red Cross Get to Hope.ly <eos> Following the phenomenal success this summer of the Ice Bucket Challenge for the A.L.S. Association, which seeks a cure for what is commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, other charities have been longing for their own viral sensations. Now the American Red Cross is introducing a fund-raising effort that, rather than creating videos or spurring supporters to upload theirs, benefits from others’ popular content. With Bitly, the six-year-old online tool that condenses long web addresses, the Red Cross is introducing Hope.ly , another URL shortener — with a twist. While the Web address for, say, AMC’s “Mad Men,” amctv.com/shows/mad-men, condenses to bit.ly/1vbqSOf, using the new tool shortens it to hope.ly/1yvAdjU. Clicking the Hope.ly link reveals what resembles a banner ad atop the page, proclaiming, “Someone wonderful shared this page — to help people in need through the American Red Cross,” and encouraging donating online. The new tool will be announced on Tuesday as part of Giving Tuesday , a worldwide effort to encourage supporting charities during the holiday season that was introduced in 2012 by New York’s 92nd Street Y in partnership with the United Nations Foundation. The promotion will run through December. Hope.ly is the brainchild of BBDO New York, part of the Omnicom Group, which is the agency of record for the Red Cross. “Charities generally are trying to get large-scale social reach in the same way that the A.L.S. Ice Bucket Challenge did,” said Tom Markham, the executive creative director of BBDO New York. “This idea is kind of in that space, but it’s tied into the act of sharing, as opposed to us trying to come up with the content that is super shareable.” Introduced in 2008, Bitly has grown rapidly because, along with shortening URLs for character-limited social media like Twitter, it helps users monitor how others subsequently share the links that they share. The company, based in New York, reports that it shortens 600 million links a month, and that those links are clicked on eight billion times. Laura Maiurano, senior director for digital marketing at Bitly, said the new project was unlike anything the service had done before. “When BBDO and the Red Cross approached us with this effort, we just thought it was a really great initiative and something new and different and we were totally on board to support it,” Ms. Maiurano said. A recent survey commissioned by the Red Cross found that among social media users, after seeing a friend’s post about making a donation to a charity, almost 20 percent would also make a donation; 25 percent would donate to a charity if someone in their social network asked them by name to do so. “The social-media community shows this propensity to give,” said Laura Howe, the vice president for public relations at the Red Cross, “so that tells us it’s a group of people that as an organization we definitely want to be in front of.” Brian Morrissey, editor in chief of Digiday, an online publication that covers digital marketing and media, noted that unlike brands and charities that often ask consumers to upload photos, complete forms or send e-cards, the Hope.ly effort made participation simple. “What I like about this is that they’re sort of integrating their marketing campaign into what people are already doing online,” Mr. Morrissey said. “The idea of converting URLs in a small way into messages of hope and charity during the holiday season is really smart and clever.” But he added that the donation message, which takes up nearly half of the screen for a smartphone held vertically, and nearly one-third of a tablet held horizontally (and even more if the pages have existing banner ads across the top), may strike some publishers as obtrusive, since it will push off much of what they intended for their landing pages. “Publishers spend a lot of time trying to get the user experience right because it takes a lot of testing and experimentation to get people to stick around on a website, and having someone else change all of that for the user is tough,” Mr. Morrissey said. He added that publishers were unlikely to complain about this being done for a popular charity like the Red Cross, but would raise a fuss if Bitly tried to execute a similar program on behalf of brands. Bitly wrote in a response that “while we can’t say whether or not we’ll do this with another partner” in the future, “we certainly would be selective.” In November, along with making a $25 million donation to fight Ebola, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg added a “Donate” button to the top of newsfeeds for users of the social network, and posted a video to Facebook about doing so. An online video introduces Hope.ly, and it will be promoted on the Bitly landing page and on the Red Cross’s social channels, but BBDO, the ad agency that came up with the idea is not, ironically, making any ads for it. Mr. Markham of BBDO said that while the execution is not the sort of thing clients request in assignments known as creative briefs, it does exemplify one way that agencies should advocate for charities and brands. “It’s very hard to brief for an idea like this,” said Mr. Markham of the Hope.ly effort. “The agency has to kind of love you as a client and spend time thinking of you outside of the normal briefs and come up with this sort of stuff.”",

    "source": "Their Season Lost, Mets Search for Silver Linings <eos> Here was their chance to interrogate a few of the men responsible for the Mets ’ latest collapse. The manager, Terry Collins, and general manager, Sandy Alderson, entertained questions from about 1,500 season-ticket holders for about an hour Sunday morning at Citi Field, as did Mike Baxter, Jon Niese and the third base coach Tim Teufel. There was much explaining to do, the Mets having won six games in three weeks, having plunged further into despair with poor showings this week against the Rockies and the Astros . Any remaining optimism could have been mistaken for delirium. Which superhero do you prefer, one woman asked: Batman, Superman or Spiderman? Another wanted the definition of a balk. One man inquired, in a less-than-demanding tone, about the futures of David Wright and R. A. Dickey, who both have team options for next season. “I fully expect that David Wright and R. A. Dickey will be here, not only next year but longer term,” Alderson said to applause that was hearty for midmorning. Later, the 25,071 fans here screamed and danced as Ike Davis rounded the bases for his game-winning home run, his second solo shot of the game, as the Mets won, 2-1 . The rookie starter Jeremy Hefner had shut out the Astros for eight innings. In the ninth, true to the Mets’ form of late, Lucas Duda appeared to misplay a fly ball in left and the tying run scored. Duda, who returned Sunday for the first time since he was demoted July 24, gunned down the potential winning run at home two batters later, and many fans gave him a standing ovation. But louder than that was the one for Davis’s home run. After the game, Collins said the Mets badly needed the victory. The win, merely a flickering candle in a dark, cavernous room, offered some light — not for the postseason, but for the next five weeks while the Mets audition to keep their fans coming and for Wright and Dickey to stay, too. So Alderson’s pronouncement came as no surprise; he has the unenviable task of balancing the meek present of these Mets and developing their future. “It is not our intention to simply rely on those options and go into next season and deal with their free agency after 2013,” Alderson told the gathering. “We’re going to deal with it upfront while we still have a little bit of room to maneuver.” His usual thoughtful self, Dickey indicated that he was open to signing a new deal with the Mets — “a part of me enjoys being loyal to an organization that’s given me a shot,” he said — but had a few stipulations. In particular, he would want any negotiations resolved entering 2013, as he found them to be a distraction when they trickled into May this season. “I do want to win, too, because I am at the place that I am in my career,” Dickey, 37, said. But he added: “I want to be part of that solution here, whatever that is going to be. I would like to know what direction they’re going, and I think that’s fair.” Wright echoed those sentiments, but less heartily. Although Wright declined to discuss his contract situation in detail, he said he was happy with his deal, which includes a $16 million team option for next season, indicating he could play out his contract, then evaluate. In either case, Alderson has little time to show progress. The Mets’ payroll is roughly $100 million this season. About next season, Alderson said, “I’m hopeful we’ll be in the same range, if not somewhat higher.” He added, “What I’m looking at is what our needs are and how we fill those needs, and there’s no question that being able to add payroll is an important part of being able to address those.” For another season, he will be handcuffed by Johan Santana’s and Jason Bay’s bloated contracts, creating curious timing. Santana and Bay are owed a combined $41.5 million in 2013, and buying out their team options would save the Mets $33.5 million in 2014, when Dickey and Wright could become free agents. Until then, Alderson has been asked to prepare for a range of payroll totals. He said he would know his limit in a few weeks. Dickey would stand to receive a raise, as his $5 million team option would significantly undercompensate a Cy Young Award candidate. With the time and money these Mets have devoted to pitching, they could reward Dickey or undervalue him, with young arms on the way. Collins mentioned Matt Harvey, Zack Wheeler, Collin McHugh, Josh Edgin, and Davis and Duda as reasons for Wright and Dickey to sign on. “My hope is that you can see some payroll coming off the books in a couple of years,” Dickey said, “and you can see some things starting to take shape, some pieces starting to — the hope is that you’re going to be able to do a lot of good with that and be competitive. But that’s me speculating, almost as a fan.”",

    "source": "China Passes New Safeguards for Criminal Suspects <eos> BEIJING — China ’s national legislature enacted new safeguards for criminal suspects and defendants on Wednesday, but upheld the right of the police to hold certain suspects in secret residential locations for up to six months, ignoring a last-minute online campaign by critics to curb police authority. Nearly 8 percent of the delegates abstained or voted against the legislation, an unusual display of disagreement within the handpicked National People’s Congress. The online effort to postpone the vote was blocked when censors erased messages from a microblogging site. Chen Guangzhong, an expert on criminal procedure and an adviser to the committee that drafted the amendments, said that the revised Criminal Procedure Law provides greater protection for suspects subjected to residential confinement, including requiring the police to notify a suspect’s relatives within 24 hours of his detention. But the police will still be allowed to hold suspects in their homes for up to six months. And those suspected of threatening national security, terrorism or serious corruption can be held outside their homes for the same length of time without telling relatives the location or reason. “There are still shortcomings that need to be addressed in the future,” Mr. Chen said. Human rights advocates, criminal defense lawyers and others argued that the police have used residential confinement to silence and punish a wide array of dissidents and government critics. They object to confinement in secret, isolated settings, arguing that suspects are more easily abused and tortured. Chen Youxi, a Beijing criminal lawyer, said that residential detention “should only and always be at the suspect’s own home.” Mr. Chen said that law enforcement authorities insisted that residential detention was a necessary option because the police needed more time to investigate certain cases. The law allows suspects to be held in formal detention centers for no more than 37 days without formal arrest. He said he had contended that the police should be required to notify suspects’ relatives of the location and reason for residential confinement because, otherwise, suspects would not be able to exercise their rights to defense lawyers. But law enforcement officials said the requirement was too burdensome. Legal experts said the revised law explicitly forbids the use of evidence extracted by torture, allows defense lawyers to attend police interrogations and requires videotaped interrogations if the penalty for the crime is at least 10 years in prison. Divisions in the National People’s Congress occur from time to time. Xiong Wei, a Beijing researcher who studies the legislative process, noted that in 1992, about a third of the delegates abstained or voted against the plan for the Three Gorges Dam. On Wednesday, of the 2,856 delegates, 160 voted against the Criminal Procedure Law revisions, and 57 abstained. Mr. Xiong began an online campaign to delay the vote, arguing that the delegates were presented with the final legislation after the legal deadline. His posting Monday on the microblogging service Sina Weibo was forwarded 18,000 times, he said, before a worker for the company called him, apologetically explaining that it had been deleted, being deemed “too sensitive.”",

    "source": "Bernanke Urges Flexibility in Mortgage Regulation <eos> Ben S. Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , urged Congress on Monday to allow federal agencies more leeway in overseeing the ailing mortgage industry, emphasizing that the causes of the current foreclosure crisis were more difficult to address than those in the past. “Realistic public and private sector policies must take into account the fact that traditional foreclosure avoidance strategies may not always work well in the current environment,” Mr. Bernanke said at a Columbia Business School event at the Waldorf-Astoria in Midtown Manhattan. In a 10-page speech, Mr. Bernanke said that some regions of the country — including California, Florida, Colorado and parts of the Midwest — have experienced sharp increases in the number of homeowners who are delinquent on their mortgages, despite data that does not reveal the classic causes of foreclosures, like higher unemployment rates. Instead, much of the problem can be attributed to a decline in home prices, which, Mr. Bernanke said, can “reduce the ability and incentive of homeowners, particularly those under financial stress for other reasons, to retain their homes.” A high concentration of speculators and owners of second homes, who may have less incentive to hold onto their property, also contributes to more delinquencies, Mr. Bernanke said. The variety of factors leading to foreclosures makes it more difficult for mortgage lenders to help ailing homeowners, Mr. Bernanke said, noting that “lenders and services will have to develop new and flexible strategies to deal with this issue.” In response, Mr. Bernanke recommended that government agencies take a more innovative approach to ensure that only qualified buyers take out loans. He urged Congress to provide the Federal Housing Administration, which insures mortgage loans, with “greater latitude” in setting appropriate standards for owners seeking to refinance their mortgages, and to adjust interest rates according to the level of risk of the applicants. It was this system that went awry in the subprime mortgage crisis, the root of the current economic turmoil. In many cases, mortgages were given to owners who could not afford to repay them, resulting in a wave of foreclosures. Mr. Bernanke also called for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big mortgage financiers supervised by the government, to raise more money to help assist homeowners at risk of foreclosure. He warned that the rising foreclosure rate, if left unchecked, would harm the broader economy. “The costs of foreclosure may extend well beyond those borne directly by the borrower and the lender,” Mr. Bernanke said. He said that a rise in foreclosures adds to sagging inventories and can weigh down home prices, which hurts household worth and, ultimately, the health of Wall Street’s biggest banks.",

Trump’s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, resigned on Friday from his role as a CNN political commentator, ending a television deal that had attracted scrutiny and harsh criticism about the cable channel’s journalistic ethics. Mr. Lewandowski, who joined CNN as a paid contributor days after being fired by Mr. Trump in June, has expressed interest in a senior adviser role in the White House, according to a person briefed on discussions within the Trump transition team. His name has also been mentioned as a potential chairman of the Republican National Committee, this person said. Mr. Lewandowski has been frequently spotted this week at Trump Tower in Manhattan, chatting with senior aides and attending meetings. Even as he defended Mr. Trump in front of millions of viewers on CNN talk shows, Mr. Lewandowski stayed in regular contact with the candidate and flew on the Trump campaign jet. He also received tens of thousands of dollars in severance from the Trump campaign, payments that were set to continue through the end of the year. The arrangement raised concerns about whether CNN was effectively paying a Trump campaign strategist to spin its viewers. Other networks, including MSNBC, regularly invite campaign representatives onto shows, but do not pay them. CNN and its president, Jeffrey A. Zucker, steadfastly defended Mr. Lewandowski’s hiring, saying that the network wanted to regularly provide viewers with on-air voices representing both candidates. But CNN’s critics saw in Mr. Lewandowski another sign of television news accommodating a candidate who was a ratings magnet. Because of a nondisclosure agreement, Mr. Lewandowski was limited in what he could discuss about Mr. Trump on the air. As recently as two weeks ago, Mr. Lewandowski traveled aboard the Trump campaign plane to his home state of New Hampshire. Onboard, Mr. Lewandowski discussed strategy with Mr. Trump and his top advisers, including Stephen K. Bannon, his campaign chief executive. After the flight was reported in The New York Times , a spokeswoman for CNN, Allison Gollust, said Mr. Lewandowski’s status at the network remained unchanged. “We were aware of his trip and granted our permission,” Ms. Gollust wrote in an email this week. Mr. Lewandowski, who last appeared on CNN on Wednesday morning, did not respond to a request for comment. On Friday, he was seen arriving at Trump Tower around 9:30 a.m.",

The study found that Hispanic workers — mainly legal and illegal immigrants — accounted for about 40 percent of all the workers who joined the United States labor force in the last year, more than any other group. Much of the job growth for Hispanics came in the construction industry in the South and the Western states. While wages rose faster for Hispanics over the last year than for other workers, they continued to have the lowest median wage of any group.

    "source": "Senators Push to Preserve N.S.A. Phone Surveillance <eos> WASHINGTON — The Senate Intelligence Committee appears to be moving toward swift passage of a bill that would “change but preserve” the once-secret National Security Agency program that is keeping logs of every American’s phone calls, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who leads the panel, said Thursday. Ms. Feinstein, speaking at a rare public hearing of the committee, said she and the top Republican on the panel, Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, are drafting a bill that would be marked up — meaning that lawmakers could propose amendments to it before voting it out of committee — as early as next week. After the existence of the program became public by leaks from the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden, critics called for it to be dismantled. Ms. Feinstein said her bill would be aimed at increasing public confidence in the program, which she said she believed was lawful. The measure would require public reports of how often the N.S.A. had used the calling log database, she said. It would also reduce the number of years — currently five — that the domestic calling log data is kept before it is deleted. It would also require the N.S.A. to send lists of the phone numbers it searches, and its rationale for doing so, to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for review. By contrast, a rival bill drafted by skeptics of government surveillance, including two members of the committee, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, would ban the mass call log collection program. That more extensive step is unlikely to pass the committee. Ms. Feinstein contended that “a majority of the committee” believed that the call log program was “necessary for our nation’s security.” Ms. Feinstein said her bill with Mr. Chambliss would also require Senate confirmation of the N.S.A.’s director. At the same time, it would expand the N.S.A.’s powers to wiretap without warrants in the United States in one respect: when it is eavesdropping on a foreigner’s cellphone, and that person travels to the United States, the N.S.A. would be allowed to keep wiretapping for up to a week while it seeks court permission. That step would remove the largest number of incidents in which the N.S.A. has deemed itself to have broken rules about surveillance in the United States. Those incidents were identified in a May 2012 audit leaked by Mr. Snowden . The rival proposals pushed by Mr. Wyden and Mr. Udall would also ban the N.S.A. from warrantless searches of Americans’ information in the vast databases of communications it collects by targeting noncitizens abroad. And it would prohibit, when terrorism is not suspected, systematic searches of the contents of Americans’ international e-mails and text messages that are “about” a target rather than to or from that person. Still, most of the senators on the Intelligence Committee, which had received briefings about the call log program and other surveillance even before Mr. Snowden’s leaks, used the hearing on Thursday to largely defend the programs and criticize the disclosures. Mr. Chambliss suggested that people could die because of Mr. Snowden’s disclosures, and he pressed Gen. Keith Alexander, the N.S.A. director, to describe the program’s value. “In my opinion,” General Alexander said, “if we had had that prior to 9/11, we would have known about the plot.” Officials have struggled to identify terrorist attacks that would have been prevented by the call log program, which has existed in its current form since 2006. The clearest breakthrough attributed to the program was a case involving several San Diego men who were prosecuted for donating several thousand dollars to a terrorist group in Somalia. Mr. Wyden pressed General Alexander about whether the N.S.A. had ever collected, or made plans to collect, bulk records about Americans’ locations based on cellphone tower data. General Alexander replied that the N.S.A. is not doing so as part of the call log program, but that information pertinent to Mr. Wyden’s question was classified.",

    "source": "Austria Says Man Jailed Daughter for 24 Years <eos> FRANKFURT — Austrian police arrested a 73-year-old man who they say kept his daughter locked in a cellar for 24 years and fathered seven children with her, three of whom never emerged into daylight from their prison until now. The woman, identified by the police as Elisabeth F., was released by her father, Josef F., after her eldest daughter, 19, became ill and was taken to a hospital. Doctors had appealed for her mother to come forward to share details of her medical history. The authorities said she was still in serious condition. The police referred to the family name by initial only as is standard procedure in criminal cases in Austria. In its macabre details, the case carries echoes of the kidnapping of Natascha Kampusch, an Austrian schoolgirl who was held in a windowless basement cell for eight years before escaping in August 2006. This latest case, which unfolded in a nondescript, three-story apartment house in Amstetten, a town 80 miles west of Vienna, is, if possible, even harder to comprehend. Elisabeth, 42, told the police that in 1984, her father drugged, handcuffed and dragged her into a basement, accessible only through a hidden door with an electronic code. She said she spent close to the next quarter-century imprisoned there, a constant victim of sexual abuse and incest by her father. “This is not a mother abandoning her child, which then had to be admitted to the hospital,” Franz Polzer, chief of the criminal investigations unit for the province of Lower Austria, said at a news conference on Sunday, according to Reuters. “We know that she herself has been kept imprisoned by her own father for 24 years in the basement,” he said, “and furthermore, she obviously was also subjected to sexual abuse.” Elisabeth gave birth to seven children during that time, one of whom died shortly after birth, the police said. Her father ordered her to give up three of the children, who were then adopted or cared for as foster children by Josef and his wife, Rosemarie, the mother of Elisabeth. The police said Rosemarie apparently did not know of her daughter’s ordeal, believing that she had left the children on her parents’ doorstep because she was unable to care for them herself. When Elisabeth disappeared in 1984, her father claimed that she had written a letter asking her parents not to search for her. Three of the children born in the basement — now 19, 18 and 5 — never left it, the police said.. When Josef brought Elisabeth and the others out of confinement, he told his wife that their “missing” daughter had returned. He is in police custody, charged with abduction and incest. Elisabeth told the police that she had been sexually abused by her father from the age of 11. The authorities said they would perform DNA tests to determine whether Josef is the father of the children. Also a mystery is how Josef, an electrical engineer, was able to conceal his daughter and her children for so long. Behind the door, for which only Josef had the access code, he built a dwelling capable of sustaining a family. “There is not only one, but a number of rooms: one room to sleep in, one to cook, and there are also sanitation facilities,” Mr. Polzer said in interview with the Austrian broadcaster ORF. Neighbors were flabbergasted. “It is so horrible,” Corina Schmid said to ORF. “I can see the house from my balcony and from my window, and when I think now of who was in there, I can simply not imagine that.”",

    "source": "Russia Seeks Pledge From NATO on Missile Defense <eos> KALININGRAD, Russia — Russia is seeking assurances from NATO that any missile defense system the military alliance deploys in Europe will not be directed against the country. “We do not want any missiles aimed at Russia,” the foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said after talks in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad with his counterparts from Germany, Guido Westerwelle, and Poland, Radek Sikorski. The meeting in Kaliningrad was part of an effort by the three countries to work together over political, security, energy and visa issues. “This is about cooperation, not confrontation, about discussing concrete projects,” Mr. Westerwelle told hundreds of students at Kant University who had gathered to question the three officials. Mr. Lavrov said Russia wanted “some kind of written guarantees from NATO that the missiles will not threaten Russia.” Russia has in the past threatened to place missiles in Kaliningrad — a small area with a population of nearly one million that is sandwiched between two European Union countries, Poland and Lithuania — in response to NATO’s plans to deploy part of its missile shield in Eastern Europe. President Obama, who is to visit Poland next week, intends to deploy Patriot missiles there, but not the original missile shield system that the administration of President George W. Bush had promised to do. The Bush administration’s plans to place parts of the missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic, which were once part of the Soviet military alliance, led to a sharp deterioration of relations between Washington and Moscow. The Russian prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, has said that the deployments would undermine Russia’s security. Mr. Obama’s decision to shift strategy was not only because of the costs and the need to modify the scope of any missile defense system that would provide a much broader security umbrella over Europe. The administration said it also wanted to “reset” its relations with Russia. During Saturday’s discussions, the ministers agreed that their meeting could evolve into something more permanent — like the Weimar Triangle, which the French, German and Polish foreign ministers set up 20 years ago after the reunification of Germany. The Weimar Triangle helped to lead to reconciliation between Poland and Germany, ending decades of enmity and distrust. Mr. Lavrov acknowledged that Russia could not ignore Poland’s new role on the Continent, now that it is a member of the European Union and it is scheduled to take over the rotating presidency on July 1. The three officials also discussed Belarus on Saturday. Poland and Germany, with support from France, want European foreign ministers to impose more sanctions against Belarus. The sanctions, already imposed on the top leadership, could be extended to some enterprise managers. At the same time, Poland and Germany intend to strengthen their ties to civil society and the democratic opposition. Russia, however, said it opposed more sanctions. “This will only lead to further isolation,” Mr. Lavrov said. “That will do nothing to help the way towards direction.”",

    "source": "Arizona Group to Sue Paterson Over Order on Gay Marriages <eos> ALBANY — An Arizona-based conservative Christian group said on Friday that it planned to sue Gov. David A. Paterson to block his directive to state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages performed outside New York. Brian Raum, the senior legal counsel for the group, the Alliance Defense Fund, said that it would file a lawsuit next week claiming that Mr. Paterson’s order sidestepped the Legislature. The Alliance, which was founded by James C. Dobson and others, has been active in efforts in other states to limit marriage to heterosexuals. “This is directly the province of the Legislature,” Mr. Raum said. “The Court of Appeals said marriage in New York is one man, one woman. And if that’s going to change, it has to come from the Legislature. What Paterson is doing is circumventing that process.” Through his chief spokeswoman, Mr. Paterson declined comment. The governor said this week that his directive was intended to bring state agencies into compliance with an appellate court ruling in February that said New York must recognize same-sex marriages that have been performed outside the state. Also on Friday, Senate Republicans in Albany were trying to decide how to respond to the governor’s directive. The majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, said in a radio interview on Friday that he hoped to have an answer from his counsel by next week about whether they could take the governor to court. At the same time, Mr. Bruno conceded that any legislative action the Republican-led Senate might take would be largely symbolic because such a measure was almost certain to fail in the Assembly, which has supported same-sex marriage. Mr. Bruno ruled out moving a bill to make a political statement. “We’re not committing because we’re waiting to see how the rest of this plays out,” he said. “The bottom line is, whatever we do, the Assembly won’t join us. The Democrats control the Assembly.” The Assembly overwhelmingly passed a bill last summer to allow same-sex marriages, but Senate Republicans have refused to bring the bill to a vote. Mr. Bruno said the basis for any legal battle would be an argument that the governor’s directive violated the doctrine on the separation of powers. The directive, written by the governor’s legal counsel, David M. Nocenti, asked all state agencies to revise their policies to conform to the appeals court ruling and to report back to Mr. Nocenti by June 30. “It’s the executive taking legislative powers away,” Mr. Bruno said on WGDJ-AM (Talk 1300), a radio station in Albany. “If there’s going to be a court battle, that’s what it’ll be over, not the issue itself.” He said the Senate Republicans are not opposed to gay rights. “I don’t care whether they’re gay, black, white, Oriental, whatever. Equal justice. That’s what it’s all about,” Mr. Bruno said.",

    "source": "Road Through Roman History Creates Colossal Headache <eos> ROME — Via dei Fori Imperiali, a multilane artery running through the heart of Rome, is typically a frenzy of swerving Vespas, zipping Smart cars and honking Fiat taxis. But Mayor Ignazio Marino is seeking to transform the avenue to something calmer, where Gucci loafers and sensible sneakers would rule. Mr. Marino’s plan to ban private traffic on the roadway, which bisects a vast archaeological site, from the central Piazza Venezia to the Colosseum, has prompted grousing and histrionic debate over a project that conservators say would solidify the world’s largest urban archaeological area. This being Rome, the first high-impact initiative of his seven-week-old administration, which goes into effect on Saturday, has provoked its share of unfavorable comparisons with the overweening ambitions of emperors past. “The mayor’s job is not to pass into history, but to work for his citizens,” said Luciano Canfora, a professor of classics at the University of Bari. “We already had Nero, that’s more than enough.” He predicted the plan would “torture” other Romans with “catastrophic” traffic jams. To the mayor, though, the project is the cornerstone of a bigger vision that plays on Rome’s strengths and uniqueness to develop a strategy for the city based on environmental and cultural sustainability. “I want to change what was a highly trafficked street into a walk into history,” Mr. Marino, 58, said in an interview at his offices on the Capitoline Hill, which overlooks the Roman Forum. “It’s part of a dream of giving back to Romans, Italians and people from around the world this incredible place where the history of the Western world developed.” Image Mayor Ignazio Marino of Rome wants to ban private vehicles on the road. Credit Alessandro Penso for The International Herald Tribune Of course, modern Romans, and especially the neighborhood’s residents, have more practical concerns. Most have to do with the anticipated spillover effect of closing a broad avenue used by as many as 1,600 motorists an hour during peak times of day, according to city statistics. Residents’ associations and local shopkeepers fret about aggravating the traffic congestion that is already as quintessentially Roman as the city’s famed cupolas, making their lives even more “invivibile,” a common Italian expression used by those complaining about life in the capital. “We will block the streets, set up barricades,” pledged Luciana Gasparini, the president of Via Merulana per L’Esquilino, a neighborhood group that is organizing a protest against the project. (But, in Roman fashion, it will take place in September, once people have returned from their August holidays.) Franco Aldini, a tailor with a shop on Via Labicana, complained that his business had already dropped since street work began in preparation for the closing. Mr. Aldini said he was considering suing the city for damages if the situation dragged on. “The mayor can’t decide from one day to the next to lock down a neighborhood,” he said. But it seems that the mayor can, and did, forging ahead with a project that was a centerpiece of his campaign. In this first phase, the tract of Via dei Fori Imperiali closest to the Colosseum will be off limits to private vehicles, but not to buses and taxis. A rather optimistic simulation is visible on the city’s transportation Web site. The final goal is to make the Via dei Fori Imperiali a pedestrian area from one end to the other, and to finance the project with subsidies from the European Union. “I think Rome needed a kind of shock,” said the mayor, a former transplant surgeon, using the analogy of a person receiving emergency treatment. “The city had been sleeping and needed to wake up. After the shock, you go on to live a long, productive life.” Image Luciana Gasparini is planning a protest against the project. “We will block the streets,” she said. Credit Alessandro Penso for The International Herald Tribune Mr. Marino spent nearly 20 years of his career as a doctor in the United States before returning to Rome in 2006, when he plunged into politics and was elected to the Senate with the center-left Democratic Party. This year, he decided not to run again at a national level but instead turned his sights on Rome, the city he “loves most in the world,” he said. Mr. Marino easily beat Gianni Alemanno, the incumbent, center-right mayor, in June. Mr. Marino cheerfully acknowledged that he would be “crucified” by citizens in the short term, but said it was worth fighting for his “vision of what I want this city to be in 30 years.” He added, “No one will remember who the mayor was in 2013, but everyone will appreciate the pedestrian area.” Via dei Fori Imperiali was built during the 1920s by Benito Mussolini, the Fascist dictator, as a marching avenue for triumphant troops, linking his palace in Piazza Venezia to the Colosseum, the most recognizable symbol of ancient Roman power. It was an ambitious project that destroyed a densely populated area of central Rome, and also separated the Roman Forum from the imperial forums of Trajan, Augustus, Caesar and Nerva. Conservators and municipal and state archaeology officials have long nurtured the wish to reconnect the forums. They have also been keen to limit the effect of traffic on the monuments, including vibrations and smog, “which is eating away at the surface of the monuments, like those terrible photos showing how cigarettes eat away at one’s lungs,” said Rossella Rea, the culture ministry official responsible for the Colosseum. But in a city where history is as stratified as lasagna, some argue that the Via dei Fori Imperiali has its own notable, equally valid past and so should be preserved. “It is the result of an operation undertaken under Fascism that changed the face of the city, like the 19th-century boulevards that changed Paris,” said Professor Canfora. “No one would dare to ask to turn back French history,” he added, so why “think that you can return Rome to an archaeological site.” Actually, the mayor said he hoped that the road closing would help modify Romans’ driving habits, by encouraging more people to leave their vehicles at home. He said about 60 percent of Romans travel less than five kilometers a day — roughly three miles — to get to work. “As a scientist, I find that numbers give a more clear and precise picture,” he said, and gave a few facts: 970 of 1,000 adult Romans have cars, compared with 340 in London, and the average speed of public transportation in Rome is less than 9 miles per hour. “One of the slowest in the Western world,” he said. “You could run faster.”",

    "source": "Stephens and Williams to Face Off as Their Nascent Rivalry Heats Up <eos> Serena Williams may have to settle for revenge being served eight months later. Williams, the top seed, takes on 15th-seeded Sloane Stephens in the fourth round of the United States Open on Sunday. That will be the third installment of what has become one of the most tantalizing rivalries in tennis, a pairing of the top two American women that has produced not only compelling tennis, but also copious drama off the court. Last year, before they had ever played each other, Williams, 31, and Stephens, 20, frequently discussed the closeness of their friendship, which grew tighter when they played together on the United States Fed Cup team early in 2012. “Oh, my God, I love her to death; she’s amazing,” Stephens said of Williams at the time. “Now she’s like an actual person, and I’m like: ‘Oh, hi. How is it going?’ She’s not like a hero anymore. She’s just a friend.” But the tenor of their relationship changed after they faced off for the first time, in January. In a fiercely competitive match, Williams defeated Stephens, 6-4, 6-3, in Brisbane, Australia. As Williams closed out the victory, Stephens was taken aback by the volume of Williams’s self-exhortations, telling her coach, Troy Hahn, that they were “disrespectful.” Stephens retaliated on a bigger stage three weeks later, upsetting Williams, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, keeping her composure as Williams visibly struggled with pain in her ankle and her back. It was the first time Williams had lost to a younger American. In her on-court interview after the victory, a stunned Stephens was reminded that she’d had on her bedroom wall a poster of the woman she had just beaten. “I think I’ll put a poster of myself now,” she said, smiling. Image Sloane Stephens, above, upset Serena Williams, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. Credit Ben Solomon for The New York Times Months later, in an interview with ESPN The Magazine, published in May, Stephens said that she had hung the poster even though Williams had snubbed her for an autograph when she was a child, but that she had since taken it down. There had been more apparent slights by Williams since the Australian Open: she unfollowed Stephens on Twitter, for instance, and deleted her as a contact on BlackBerry Messenger. Stephens’s remarks in that article completed a 180-degree turnaround from her previous comments on their closeness. Before their first match in January, Stephens told ESPN, “Everyone thinks she’s so mean, but she’s like the greatest person ever.” In the article in May, though, Stephens said: “People should know. They think she’s so friendly, and she’s so this and she’s so that — no, that’s not reality!” Stephens later apologized to Williams, and she has insisted that the two have moved on. Still, on Friday, her characterization of her relationship with Williams had a sterile ring. “We’re co-workers,” Stephens said. “We’re Fed Cup teammates. But other than that, everything else is private. It’s fine.” Williams has taken a different tack since the rift between the two became clear, showering Stephens with praise. After Williams lost in the fourth round at Wimbledon, she picked Stephens to win the title. (Stephens lost the next day in the quarterfinals.) Asked to name favorites for the United States Open title, Williams mentioned herself and then named Victoria Azarenka, the No. 2 seed, and Stephens. Image In January, in a fiercely competitive match, Serena Williams, above, defeated Sloane Stephens, 6-4, 6-3, in Brisbane, Australia. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times “I think Sloane has had such a good year this year,” Williams said in a news conference before the tournament. “She’s done really well in the Grand Slams — two of the Grand Slams better than I have. She’s such a good player, and she’s so smooth. I always say she’s just such a smooth player to watch. She just has this game and this confidence that, you know, that’s not easy to get. It’s so good to see her doing so well.” Williams took it a step further when she was asked about Stephens in her next news conference, two days later. “It was so good to see so many Americans doing good — mainly Sloane,” she said. “She’s such an inspiration, I think, to a lot of people.” Whether she has “inspired” is debatable, but after needing a third-set tiebreaker to survive the first round, Stephens has played some of her best tennis in her last two matches, dropping a combined six games against Urszula Radwanska and Jamie Hampton. Williams has hardly struggled herself, dropping just eight games total in her three matches. But after Williams had won in the early hours of Saturday, confirming that she would play Stephens in the fourth round, she played down her own chances. “I definitely don’t feel like I’m going in there as a favorite because she’s playing great, even though I’m playing good, too,” Williams said. “She really has nothing to lose, and she excels in situations like that.” Stephens, who had seemed uncomfortable with Williams’s declaration that she was the favorite at Wimbledon, acknowledged that Williams’s continued praise was both a blessing and a curse. “Coming from one of the greatest players to ever play the game, that feels really good. I think it’s awesome,” Stephens said. “But other than that, if you don’t really live up to it, it’s a wash.”",

    "source": "A Photographer Scales the City to Capture the View <eos> Around 4 a.m., Luis D. Rosado began making his descent from the huge History Channel billboard in the South Bronx, 10 good shots of the city at night digitally stored on his camera. He climbed down from his perch about 100 feet in the air, made his way through the vacant building below and, before stepping out, peered through a hole in scaffolding he had climbed a few hours earlier. Bad timing. A police officer in a patrol car cruising past the building, on Bruckner Boulevard, shined his flashlight at the scaffolding. Mr. Rosado said he dived onto the scaffolding’s wooden planks, but it was too late. The officer spotted movement and called for backup. Fifteen minutes later, three other police officers arrived to join in the search. “My skills were tested, and my reputation was on the line,” said Mr. Rosado, recalling his nighttime adventure. “I could not fail.” He did not. After playing hide-and-seek with the police for more than an hour and a half, he said, he managed to make a dash to his apartment half a block away. What makes a man break the law, risk his life, climb great heights and hang out above the city in the middle of the night? The drive to capture a portrait of New York City from an unusual perspective. Mr. Rosado, 29, whose hobby is photography, has climbed 50 buildings, billboards and bridges in the Bronx, he said, some multiple times. He is not alone in his passion. Shane Perez, 27, who said he had been climbing and taking photos for four years, said he knew of about 10 night-climbing photographers in the city. Mr. Rosado said that in the last few years he has focused on his own neighborhood, finding beauty in its ruggedness, and both access and interesting subjects in its abandoned buildings and industrial blocks. “This is my playground,” Mr. Rosado said one recent morning, pointing at the buildings in the South Bronx visible from the rooftop of his own, on Alexander Avenue. Mr. Rosado has a routine: after choosing a spot, he rides his gray mountain bike to it from his apartment to measure the distance. There he checks for barbed wire, security guards or dogs. He does this two or three times. Finally, dressed in black — shirt, pants, hoodie, gloves and climbing boots — Mr. Rosado makes his climb. From his vantage point above the city he aims his camera at various targets — billboards, buildings, roads. He claims a larger mission: to capture the urban landscape as it is now, before gentrification sets in and new buildings — “much bigger, much worse-designed” ones — take their place. “People are not aware of what’s going on in the neighborhood,” he said. “And from high up you see things in a way you wouldn’t from lower points.” These urban forages are thrilling, but not without risk. Mr. Rosado could be arrested or could fall. There are also security guards and dogs to dodge. So far he has escaped without harm. The Police Department said it did not keep records on people arrested for climbing buildings and bridges, partly because the instances were so few and far between. But capture can result in charges of criminal trespass and reckless endangerment. Mr. Rosado willingly takes the risk, likening himself to an urban ninja proficient in the art of climbing. He said he had always loved heights. While his missionary parents tried to convert indigenous people of Peru, Chile and Ecuador to Pentecostalism, a 3-year-old Luis climbed trees in the surrounding jungles. His family moved back to their native Puerto Rico when he turned 5, and there he found a stunning vantage point from the rooftop of the church. “My father owned the church, so I couldn’t get in trouble,” Mr. Rosado said. As his father, Angel L. Rosado, traveled, founding churches in New York and Colchester, Vt., Luis Rosado found new structures to climb. But in Vermont a new passion was born. At 18, he started taking photography classes at his high school. “For the first time I could express myself,” Mr. Rosado said. “There was no limit to possibilities.” Four years later he returned to New York, this time with an associate’s degree in photography and graphic design. His two interests merged. “New York was free for the taking,” Mr. Rosado said. “I wanted to take my camera everywhere.” His photography was on display this summer at the LDR Studio Gallery — his apartment, which he converted into living space three years ago, mainly to curate and display work by other artists. Called “Changes in the Bronx,” the show was a collaboration of photos and videos with Benton-C Bainbridge , 44, a video artist who has had exhibitions at the Whitney and the Museum of Modern Art. “Luis and I are kindred spirits,” Mr. Bainbridge said. “We’re capturing and looking to expose things that people don’t see.” To support his photography and gallery, Mr. Rosado works as a doorman on the Upper East Side. That job leaves him with enough time to hatch new plans. On a recent Sunday, Mr. Rosado enthusiastically spoke of the next spot he wanted to climb and shoot from. His brown eyes wide in amazement, he pointed up 65 feet to the top of the new Willis Avenue Bridge. Mr. Rosado said he did not fear another close encounter with the police. If it happened, there was always a good route for escape. “I’m a good swimmer,” he said, smiling.",

    "source": "Equestrians’ Latest Safety Option Is the Air Bag <eos> Spectators gasped and expected the worst when the horse ridden by Karim Florent Laghouag somersaulted over a fence and fell on top of him at a prestigious equestrian competition last September in France. Laghouag had taken a so-called rotational fall, a dreaded spill in the Olympic sport of eventing. At least 13 riders in the past four years were killed and several others were seriously injured in such tumbles. But soon after his horse jumped to its feet, Laghouag stood up too. He had a dislocated elbow but no broken bones. He attributed his good fortune to an air bag vest, a simple safety innovation that was virtually unheard of in the equestrian world until last year and now is standard issue for the world’s top riders. “Today, I wear it all the time — even when I’m training,” Laghouag, 35, said in French during a recent telephone interview. Leaders in eventing — a three-phase competition involving dressage, show jumping and a cross-country obstacle course — have long expressed frustration over attempts to make the cross-country portion safer. They have tried imposing stricter rules on riders and building fences designed to break apart more easily on impact. But the arrival of the air bag vests has generated the most excitement, even though some caution that the technology is too new to be wholly embraced. “It’s certainly the biggest step forward in the safety of our sport, ever,” said Oliver Townend, a British rider who was wearing a vest in April when his horse tumbled on top of him at the Kentucky Three-Day Event in Lexington. Townend broke his sternum, four ribs, his collarbone and the tips of his shoulder bones — but he says he still believes in the vest. “I walked out of hospital the next day, where otherwise I would be in a box or in America for a month,” Townend said in a recent phone interview. Inflatable vests have been sold to motorcyclists for about a decade, but few equestrians used them until a British company, Point Two Air Jackets , adapted them for use on horses and began distributing them at top European competitions last year. Hit Air , a Japanese company that says it has been selling motorcycle vests since 1999, also sells an equestrian version. They each rely on similar technology. The two-pound vest is attached by a cord to a rider’s saddle and is worn over a traditional protective vest made of high-density foam. When a rider is thrown from a horse, the cord is yanked, puncturing a cartridge of carbon dioxide and inflating the vest. The vest can be reused after the cartridge is replaced. Point Two said its vest inflates in one-tenth of a second; Hit Air said its average rate is one-quarter of a second. Despite their relatively high cost — from about $390 to $700 — the vests have sold well. About 6,000 eventing riders now wear the Point Two vests, according to the company, and Hit Air said it had sold about 10,000 vests for equestrian use worldwide. Lee Middleton, director of Point Two, said his product was worn by the top 40 American riders, and that several national teams, including the United States, would provide air bag vests to their riders at next month’s World Equestrian Games in Kentucky. He provides some vests free to riders like Townend and Laghouag, who are not paid to be spokesmen. “Anything like that, that can minimize the effects of an injury during a fall, is going to be great,” said David O’Connor, the president of the United States Equestrian Federation and an Olympic gold medalist. Until recently, he also headed the international federation’s eventing safety subcommittee. “I think they’ve proven themselves already — and certainly with the people that have had falls with them — they swear by them.” The eventing rider Doug Payne , who is sponsored by Hit Air, said he had fallen four times while wearing the vest. “It’s an interesting thing,” he said. “As you’re falling, everything sort of slows down. You do notice a pop sound, and that’s the canister. The next thing you realize, it’s a significantly softer landing than you would ever expect.” The vests have become so common on the competition circuit that it has become a common courtesy to warn other riders to unhook their cords before dismounting. “When you arrive, everyone says: ‘Your vest! Your vest!’ ” Laghouag said. Inevitably, someone forgets. “It’s always a source of amusement,” O’Connor said. “You hear a pop, and somebody’s looking like a marshmallow.” Giuseppe Della Chiesa, the chairman of the eventing committee for the international governing body for equestrian sports, known as F.E.I., said the group recommended using the vests but did not require them because so little safety data exists. “It is a step forward as it introduces a different proven technology from other industrial areas,” Della Chiesa wrote in an e-mail. He added that the technology was passive — meant to limit the damage of accidents, rather than prevent them, which he said is at the core of the sport’s safety mission. The Point Two jackets were independently tested by the Transport Research Laboratory, a nonprofit group in Britain, which found that the air bag improved protection of the spine by 69 percent when worn over a protective vest. The air bag vest also reduced the risk of rib fractures and underlying organ damage by as much as 20 percent, the laboratory found. Kenji Takeuchi, the president of Mugen Denko, which manufactures the Hit Air vest, said by e-mail that he had conducted testing at the nonprofit Japan Automobile Research Institute. In motorcycle racing, air bag technology is still met with caution. The racer Valentino Rossi has been testing an inflatable jacket, as have other top competitors. “I would describe it as an emerging technology,” said Peter terHorst, a spokesman for the American Motorcyclist Association. He noted motorcycle accidents occurred at far higher speeds — and under different conditions — than the typical equestrian fall. “I think the best thing I could tell you is that it’s something we’re watching closely,” he said. Point Two’s Middleton said he had also spoken about the vests with representatives from the mountain bike and all-terrain-vehicle industry. Aside from being concerned about cost, some equestrian riders have expressed concern that the loud pop created when the vest is activated can spook horses. Others report feeling restricted after a fall, and worry about being able to roll to safety in an inflated vest. Some have raised questions about the effectiveness of the vests during rotational falls similar to those of Laghouag and Townend, in which the rider somersaults with the horse and frequently does not become separated from the horse until the last moment. According to statistics kept by the F.E.I. , about 25 percent of riders involved in rotational falls in international competitions from 2004 to 2009 were killed or seriously injured. Reed Ayers, an amateur eventing competitor who holds a doctorate in engineering, said he was skeptical about the benefit of the vests. He said he had heard of several riders whose vests failed to inflate in falls. “These vests can absorb some of the impact,” said Ayers, who recently conducted a safety study examining horse speeds for the United States Eventing Association. But, he added: “When you rely on a mechanical design, there’s always a possibility that it won’t work. That’s why you can’t rely on those vests as the sole protective component.” But Laghouag and Townend consider the vests lifesavers, and Middleton said that even if they failed to inflate, they would cause no harm. “You’ve got to remember they’ve got what they’ve got underneath, anyway,” he said, referring to the stiff protective vest. “This is an added bonus.”",

    "source": "Who’s Going to Take the Financial Weight? <eos> The transfer of risk was supposed to be the great advance brought to the world by financial engineers. They developed exotic derivative products that enabled risks to be sliced and diced in all manner of ways. Central banks and bank regulators cheered on the process. The transfers of risk meant that those who were comfortable with a given risk would wind up with it. The apparent triumph of that process came after the technology stock bubble burst and the American economy went into recession in 2001. A lot of money was lost because of huge overinvestment in things like fiber optic cable, but the losses were dispersed. No significant banks failed or even got into trouble. The system worked, the regulators told themselves as they praised the financial advances brought on by the derivative revolution. Sometimes those regulators did wonder just where the risk was. If it was no longer the banks that would suffer when a financial crisis came around, who would? Could it be the insurance companies? Perhaps pension plans? Would hedge funds that gambled and lost be unable to meet their obligations and bring on a systemic failure? In this financial crisis, the one that started with subprime loans, we are learning the answer to that question. The risks that banks would have taken on under the old system — when banks made loans and profited only as they were paid back — had been transferred through a bewildering wilderness of options, swaps, swaptions, specialized investment vehicles, collateralized debt obligations, variable interest entities and who knows how many other instruments. And when the whole daisy chain was through, a lot of the risk seems to have ended just where it used to end. With the banks. There were differences, of course. For one, the banks are ending up taking losses from loans that others made. A suit filed this week in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan sheds light on one way this happened. American Home Mortgage Holdings, a subprime lender that went broke in August, sued Bank of America, saying it reneged on a deal to bear losses if mortgages were sold for less than face value. The bank asserts that some of the loans shouldn’t have been made at all, but American Home says that is irrelevant. Here’s how it worked, in a simplified explanation that does not come close to capturing all the complexities that the financial engineers inserted: American made subprime loans and sold them to special purpose entities it set up. Those entities, in turn, financed themselves by borrowing, mostly through the short-term commercial paper market. To reassure investors, the special purpose entities entered into swap agreements with Bank of America and other big banks, in which the banks promised to make up the difference if the entities could not retain financing and therefore had to sell loans for less than par value. The chances of such a sale presumably seemed slight when the deal was made in 2004, but lots of unexpected things are cropping up these days. In late September, American auctioned off the loans. Note that these appear to be loans made in 2004 or earlier, before lending standards are supposed to have crumbled. We now have a market value for such loans. Packages of mortgages that were classified as performing — meaning the homeowner is mailing in a check every month — sold for as little as 80 percent of face value, and none went for more than 92 percent. The nonperforming loans sold in a range of 54 to 59 percent. American Home says it sent out bills to its swap partners, and all but Bank of America agreed to pay. The amount in dispute is just $25 million, an insignificant amount for the bank. But its refusal to pay may indicate an effort to find ways to shed what now seem to be foolish risks. The man in charge of that area of the bank was pushed out this week in a reorganization. The bank would not comment on the lawsuit. There are other ways that banks may come to lose a lot of money. Jonathan Weil of Bloomberg News points out that Citigroup has no legal obligation to make up losses in the specialized investment vehicles — SIVs — it set up, but some analysts think it will do so to avoid a hit to its reputation. If it does put up cash, that will call into question the accuracy of Citi’s financial statements. If not, some of Citi’s customers will be very upset. Not all the losses will end up with banks. Some will go to mutual funds and hedge funds and pension funds. Some will go to those who insured the value of securities, like Ambac Financial, which surprised Wall Street by posting its first quarterly loss this week. Still, it is remarkable that the financial engineers generated large commissions and fees by selling risk-transfer products that, in the end, moved a lot of the risk back to where it started.",

Veoh Networks, based in San Diego, filed the federal lawsuit yesterday, asking a judge to declare that the company has no liability to Universal even if individuals upload videos to the Veoh site that may contain music, used without permission, from Universal artists. Veoh argued that it was entitled to protection under the safe harbor provision of United States copyright law because it does not encourage its users to infringe copyrights and goes beyond current legal requirements to investigate and remove infringing material when notified to do so. The company said it was notified in July by Universal that the music label was considering suing Veoh because it was “massively infringing” its copyrights. The lawsuit claims Universal did not provide any details about the alleged infringement that would allow the company to investigate. “It is unfortunate that U.M.G. prefers to take actions that are designed to stifle innovation, shut down new markets and maintain the status quo instead of working to change and evolve models for today and the future,” Veoh’s chief executive, Steve Mitgang, said in a statement. Universal had previously threatened to sue the video-sharing site YouTube, which is owned by Google, but the two sides struck a licensing deal before any legal action was taken. “Universal Music Group is enthusiastic about using technology to build communities, as evidenced by our deal with YouTube,” the company said yesterday. “But that’s not what Veoh is all about. Rather, it’s about trying to build a business on the backs of our artists and songwriters without fairly compensating them for the use of their works.”",

    "source": "Arrest Dredges Up N.F.L.’s Ugly History <eos> When the North Attleborough, Mass., police chose the high-profile route of arresting Aaron Hernandez by dragging him out of his suburban oasis in handcuffs Wednesday, they did more than just trumpet their own case-cracking and give the world something to gawk at on 24-hour news channels. They were also pulling the N.F.L.'s biggest nightmare out of the closet for everyone to watch, slack-jawed, as another one of its athletes plunged into an unfathomable spot. As prosecutors then read the case to a judge, and by extension, the world, jaws slackened more. A tight end with a $40 million contract accused of murdering a friend in a plot straight out of a cheesy 1970s gangster movie? There was no sense to be made of this, just like there was no sense to be made of the Jovan Belcher murder-suicide last year in Kansas City, nor Ray Lewis’s involvement in a murder case in 2000, nor Rae Carruth’s contract hit on his pregnant girlfriend in 1999. This is why it was the N.F.L.'s nightmare rerun Wednesday, not because there is any real connection we can conclusively draw between the cases, but because Hernandez drags them all back out for us to poke over and wonder about the connection, as Mike Freeman writes on CBSSports.com . As Mark Bradley writes in The Boston Herald , this same scene plays itself out in all walks of life and not just football. But still, it’s the image of football that took a beating, and as Les Carpenter writes on Yahoo.com , it is why the Patriots cut him so fast. It’s the image the N.F.L. so desperately needs to protect, billions of dollars worth of image. The Patriots could not get the word “former” in front of “Patriots tight end” fast enough. The details of the case will be played out in public for the 24-hour endless news crowd — Lester Munson of ESPN.com outlines some of the legal issues to get you started — but Wednesday was a day to stare at a seemingly emotionless Hernandez, as Dan Wetzel describes on Yahoo.com , and try to figure out how to think about it. The N.F.L. has kindly requested you forget how many times you have been here before. (It would also like you to ignore the news of Cleveland Browns linebacker Ausar Walcott’s being arrested — he was released by his team, too — and charged with attempted murder in New Jersey after a bar fight. Yes, holy cow.) The other puzzling sports news of the day happened an ocean away and was thankfully confined to on-court happenings, but Wimbledon certainly did allow you to keep your head in that tilted-to-the-side position. That’s because players slipped, slid, thudded and pirouetted out of the tournament in such a bizarre parade of injuries that the whole sport seemed to have gone crazy. And then Roger Federer lost a second-round match to someone you have probably never heard of (Sergiy Stakhovsky). At Wimbledon. The tournament he has won a gazillion times (O.K., seven). Before Federer lost, the howling about the dangerous state of the Wimbledon grass was reaching a peak, but, as Simon Briggs writes in The Telegraph , the blame is more aptly placed on the tour, whose season is too long and its grass portion too short. One of those doing some of the howling was the upset victim Maria Sharapova, which cost the tournament more drama because of her latest fight with Serena Williams, Greg Couch writes on Foxsports.com . In the end, though, it was hard not to fixate on Federer because, as Greg Garber writes on ESPN.com , it feels like an era ending. His loss was more shocking than Rafael Nadal’s first-round face plant, Jon Wertheim argues on SI.com , and it does seem to be dwindling the Big Four down to the Big Two, as Paul Newman writes in The Independent . No one is happier about this right now than Andy Murray, who would love to win his home empire championship, and was one of the few to avoid any drama in his win Wednesday. College sports chipped in its own head scratcher to round out the day with the N.C.A.A. penalties levied against Oregon for its recruiting shenanigans, although they are more accurately described as a wrist tap . And while you could argue that the N.C.A.A. got this one largely right, as Andy Staples writes on SI.com , the problem is no one trusts anything the N.C.A.A. does these days. Dennis Dodd writes on CBSSports.com that the N.C.A.A. whiffed on an opportunity to take a stronger stand, and Pat Forde writes on Yahoo.com that Chip Kelly is the latest coach to skate out of a mess unscathed. In the admittedly professional ranks of sports, the N.B.A. offers up its draft Thursday night — you can check out the 10 burning questions courtesy of SI.com’s Chris Mannix — and the N.H.L. prompts you to take stock of its staggering playoff injury toll. After learning the Bruins’ Patrice Bergeron also had a punctured lung along with his broken rib and separated shoulder and heaven knows what else, Nicholas Cotsonika writes on Yahoo.com that perhaps we should all be examining the N.H.L.'s play-through-it ethos and stop glorifying it so much. The other side of glory often gets ugly. We have the N.F.L. to remind us of that. Repeatedly. Follow Leading Off on Twitter: twitter.com/zinsernyt",

    "source": "For Japanese Parts Not Yet Scarce, Fear of Shortages to Come <eos> SAN FRANCISCO — Tremors from the strong Japanese earthquake continue to rattle American businesses, even those companies that have experienced no disruptions in parts or supplies. Businesses in a number of industries are trying to adapt to a new reality. No longer can they count on reliable access to critical supplies, a fact prompting frantic phone calls, contingency planning and product redesigns. For instance, film and television producers, along with the companies that support them, are scrambling to stock up on commercial-grade videotape. A major supplier, the Sony Corporation , closed its factories in Japan. Many studios say they face no shortage now, but there is a fear of a shortage — and that is all it takes to put companies on edge. “Folks everywhere know there will be a shortage and are buying as much as they can,” said Thomas Engdahl, chief executive of Advanced Digital Services, which archives Hollywood shows and is among the many companies frantically calling videotape distributors. “It’s creating panic buying.” Short of parts, automakers including General Motors have slowed or stopped production at some plants. Other manufacturers like Nokia, the Finnish cellphone maker, have said they expect disruptions. But even companies that have maintained relatively normal operations have had to hustle. In San Jose, Calif., just hours after the earthquake, employees of Echelon, which sells smart meters that monitor electricity consumption, held an emergency meeting to discuss the potential effect on their supply chain. Identifying every supplier from Japan was the top priority, said Russell Harris, Echelon’s senior vice president for operations. Echelon and the contractor that builds its smart meters quickly came up with a list of 25 suppliers that were responsible for more than 50 components. Within a few days, they had contacted each one and found, to their relief, that none of those factories had been damaged. “We got lucky,” Mr. Harris said. But that is no guarantee the luck will hold. Suppliers depend on basic materials to keep their factories running, and any disruption to that spigot — a particular chemical or tiny part that has become scarce, for example — could shut down the entire chain. Production delays would be painful for Echelon. Contracts with utilities often require it to pay financial penalties for late deliveries. Because of the high stakes, Echelon had never embraced the strategy of just-in-time manufacturing, whereby companies keep just a small amount of inventory on hand. Rather, Echelon usually keeps a few months of supplies — at least for components that are available from only one source. The approach, which had lost favor among speakers at management conferences and authors of business books, turned out to be a blessing after the earthquake, Mr. Harris said. Still, he got approval to buy even more components on the spot market to tide the company over through the summer. Meanwhile, Echelon started a search for alternate suppliers outside of Japan, just in case. For some components like microcontrollers, tiny microchip-like devices, there are no other options, Mr. Harris said. For now, Echelon’s production is normal, as it tells customers who have been calling. But there remain many unknowns — how quickly Japan’s factories come back online, when transportation is restored or when the danger of nuclear contamination is over — that could still affect the supply chain. “The particular impact from this disaster is still unfolding,” Mr. Harris said. A number of companies that make circuit boards — the electronic nerve center inside computers — are also in upheaval. The earthquake caused a huge swath of Japan’s semiconductor industry to close along with the factories that make a quarter of the world’s silicon wafers, the raw material used in semiconductors, according to IHS iSuppli, a market research firm. Typically, manufacturers or distributors have stockpiled enough semiconductors and most other computer parts to feed production for several months. But to be safe, circuit board makers are starting to redesign their products so that they can more easily switch components if there is a shortage, said Paul J. Reilly, an executive vice president at Arrow Electronics, a technology supply chain company based in Melville, N.Y. “While a replacement part may function similarly, it may not have the same shape,” Mr. Reilly said. “You may not be able to squeeze it on the same computer board.” Computer board makers may never put the redesigns into production, he said. But money spent coming up with new designs is minor compared with the potential cost of stopping the assembly line. “Everyone is looking at their contingency plans,” Mr. Reilly said. In Hollywood, companies that use and sell commercial-grade videotape for television and movies are also sweating. Whether there is a shortage or simply a lot of hoarding is unclear. Filming has not been disrupted. But Sony produced several formats of videotape used by Hollywood, primarily from its Sendai plant, which was closed because of damage after the quake. Word of the plant’s problems immediately drew attention in the entertainment industry because Sony represents a big part of the market for commercial-grade videotape. Supplies of one commonly used format, HDCAM-SR, are particularly vulnerable because Sony is the only manufacturer. Buyers quickly tried to scoop up as much as possible for fear that the tape would be unavailable in the future. Fuji, Maxell and other companies also make videotape. But if a crew has to switch formats, it may need to buy new equipment or forgo some capabilities. David Cohen, chief executive of Edgewise Media, which sells film equipment to production companies involved in shooting reality shows, among others, said he had scoured the world for stock since the earthquake. To cover the extra shipping costs and mark-ups by suppliers, he has raised prices as much as 25 percent. “We’re buying as much as we can — buying at a premium to take care of our customers,” said Mr. Cohen, whose company is based in Orange, Calif. “I can’t have someone starting a show knowing that they are going to have to stop after six or seven episodes.” Sales are limited to his regular customers, and then only for the short term, he said. People planning to resell the tape at a higher price would otherwise buy out everything he has. “We don’t want people buying tape from us and sticking it on eBay and charging 10 times more for it,” Mr. Cohen said. Mr. Engdahl, from the Hollywood archiving and postproduction company, proposed to his customers that they switch to his firm’s digital archiving service instead of storing their shows on tape. After the panic dies down, he said his company could copy those clips onto tape. “We believe that with some folks going digital, we will be O.K.,” Mr. Engdahl said. “But we are having to put a lot of effort into finding tape.”",

    "source": "Larry Sanders, Bernie’s Brother, Is Running for David Cameron’s Seat in Parliament <eos> LONDON — Larry Sanders, the brother of Senator Bernie Sanders, is running to fill the seat being vacated by David Cameron, the former prime minister, in the British Parliament. Mr. Sanders, 82, was chosen on Thursday night by the Green Party as its nominee in an Oct. 20 special election in the constituency of Witney, about 67 miles west of London. Like his younger brother, Mr. Sanders grew up in New York City and attended James Madison High School and Brooklyn College. In 1969, after graduating from Harvard Law School, he moved to Oxford, England, where he has devoted his career to social work and the law and been an advocate in areas like mental health and education. The brothers are close and share progressive political views. At an emotional moment during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July, Larry Sanders, as a delegate representing Democrats who live abroad, cast a vote for his brother , saying their parents would have been “immensely proud” of him. Larry Sanders — not to be confused with the fictional late-night television host played by Garry Shandling in an HBO comedy that ran from 1992 to 1998 — has already served in public office; he was elected in 2005 to a seat on the Oxfordshire County Council, and re-elected in 2009. He is nonetheless a long shot for Mr. Cameron’s seat, which the Conservative Party has held nearly continuously since 1974; the Conservatives have chosen a 37-year-old lawyer, Robert Courts, as their candidate in what the party considers a safe seat. In interviews on Friday with Buzzfeed UK and with the radio program LBC , Mr. Sanders acknowledged that he was unlikely to win. “The underlying issues will be the one that Bernard raises, which is the fact that we’ve had growing inequality for the last 30 or 40 years, which means the bulk of the wealth and income has gone to the very richest people,” Larry Sanders told Buzzfeed UK. He added that he would also work against efforts to privatize parts of the country’s much-loved National Health Service. Mr. Cameron, who led Britain for six years, stepped down as prime minister on June 24, the day after British voters decided to leave the European Union. He initially vowed to remain in Parliament, but on Sept. 12 he resigned his seat, saying he did not want to be a distraction for his successor as prime minister, Theresa May. The Conservative Party, now led by Mrs. May, controls 329 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons, while the main opposition, the Labour Party, holds 230 seats. The Green Party holds one.",

    "source": "Los Angeles Prepares for Clash Over Marijuana <eos> LOS ANGELES — There are more marijuana stores here than public schools. Signs emblazoned with cannabis plants or green crosses sit next to dry cleaners, gas stations and restaurants. The dispensaries range from Hollywood-day-spa fabulous to shoddy-looking storefronts with hand-painted billboards. Absolute Herbal Pain Solutions, Grateful Meds, Farmacopeia Organica. Cannabis advocates claim that more than 800 dispensaries have sprouted here since 2002; some law enforcement officials say it is closer to 1,000. Whatever the real number, everyone agrees it is too high. And so this, too, is taken for granted: Crackdowns on cannabis clubs will soon come in this city, which has more dispensaries than any other. For the first time, law enforcement officials in Los Angeles have vowed to prosecute medical marijuana dispensaries that turn a profit, with police officials saying they expect to conduct raids. Their efforts are widely seen as a campaign to sway the City Council into adopting strict regulations after two years of debate. It appears to be working. Carmen A. Trutanich, the newly elected city attorney, recently persuaded the Council to put aside a proposed ordinance negotiated with medical marijuana supporters for one drafted by his office. The new proposal calls for dispensaries to have renewable permits, submit to criminal record checks, register the names of members with the police and operate on a nonprofit basis. If enacted, it is likely to result in the closing of hundreds of marijuana dispensaries. Mr. Trutanich argued that state law permits the exchange of marijuana between growers and patients on a nonprofit and noncash basis only. Marijuana advocates say that interpretation would regulate dispensaries out of existence and thwart the will of voters who approved medical cannabis in 1996. Whatever happens here will be closely watched by law enforcement officials and marijuana advocates across the country who are threading their way through federal laws that still treat marijuana as an illegal drug and state laws that are increasingly allowing medicinal use. Thirteen states have laws supporting medical marijuana, and others are considering new legislation. No state has gone further than California, often described by drug enforcement agents as a “source nation” because of the vast quantities of marijuana grown here. And no city in the state has gone further than Los Angeles. This has alarmed local officials, who say that dispensary owners here took unfair advantage of vague state laws intended to create exceptions to marijuana prohibitions for a limited number of ill people. “About 100 percent of dispensaries in Los Angeles County and the city are operating illegally,” said Steve Cooley, the Los Angeles County district attorney, who is up for re-election in 2012. “The time is right to deal with this problem.” Mr. Cooley, speaking last week at a training luncheon for regional narcotics officers titled “The Eradication of Medical Marijuana Dispensaries in the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County,” said that state law did not allow dispensaries to be for-profit enterprises. Mr. Trutanich, the city attorney, went further, saying dispensaries were prohibited from accepting cash even to reimburse growers for labor and supplies. He said that a recent California Supreme Court decision, People v. Mentch, banned all over-the-counter sales of marijuana; other officials and marijuana advocates disagree. So far, prosecutions of marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles have been limited to about a dozen in the last year, said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cooley. But Police Department officials said they were expecting to be called on soon to raid collectives. “I don’t think this is a law that we’ll have to enforce 800 times,” said one police official, who declined to speak on the record before the marijuana ordinance was completed. “This is just like anything else. You don’t have to arrest everyone who is speeding to make people slow down.” Don Duncan, a spokesman for Americans for Safe Access , a leader in the medical marijuana movement, said that over-the-counter cash purchases should be permitted but that dispensaries should be nonprofit organizations. He also said marijuana collectives needed more regulation and a “thinning of the herd.” “I am under no illusions that everyone out there is following the rules,” said Mr. Duncan, who runs his own dispensary in West Hollywood. “But just because you accept money to reimburse collectives does not mean you’re making profits.” For marijuana advocates, Los Angeles represents a critical juncture — a symbol of the movement’s greatest success, but also its vulnerability. More than 300,000 doctors’ referrals for medical cannabis are on file, the bulk of them from Los Angeles, according to Americans for Safe Access. The movement has had a string of successes in the Legislature and at the ballot box. In the city of Garden Grove, marijuana advocates forced the Highway Patrol to return six grams of marijuana it had confiscated from an eligible user. About 40 cities and counties have medical marijuana ordinances. But there have also been setbacks. In June, a federal judge sentenced Charles C. Lynch, a dispensary owner north of Santa Barbara, to one year in prison for selling marijuana to a 17-year-old boy whose father had testified that they sought out medical marijuana for his son’s chronic pain. The mayor and the chief of police testified on behalf of Mr. Lynch, who was released on bail pending appeal. And last month, San Diego police officers and sheriff’s deputies, along with agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration , raided 14 marijuana dispensaries and arrested 31 people. In an interview, Bonnie Dumanis, the district attorney for San Diego County, said that state laws governing medical marijuana were unclear and that the city had not yet instituted new regulations. Ms. Dumanis said that she approved of medical marijuana clubs where patients grow and use their own marijuana, but that none of the 60 or so dispensaries in the county operated that way. “These guys are drug dealers,” she said of the 14 that were raided. “I said publicly, if anyone thinks we’re casting too big a net and we get a legitimate patient or a lawful collective, then show us your taxes, your business license, your incorporation papers, your filings with the Department of Corporations.” “If they had these things, we wouldn’t prosecute,” she said. Marijuana supporters worry that San Diego may provide a glimpse of the near future for Los Angeles if raids here become a reality. But many look to Harborside Health Center in Oakland as a model for how dispensaries could work. “Our No. 1 task is to show that we are worthy of the public’s trust in asking to distribute medical cannabis in a safe and secure manner,” said Steve DeAngelo, the pig-tailed proprietor of Harborside, which has been in business for three years. Harborside is one of four licensed dispensaries in Oakland run as nonprofit organizations. It is the largest, with 74 employees and revenues of about $20 million. Last summer, the Oakland City Council passed an ordinance to collect taxes from the sale of marijuana, a measure that Mr. DeAngelo supported. Mr. DeAngelo designed Harborside to exude legitimacy, security and comfort. Visitors to the low-slung building are greeted by security guards who check the required physicians’ recommendations. Inside, the dispensary looks like a bank, except that the floor is covered with hemp carpeting and the eight tellers stand behind identical displays of marijuana and hashish. There is a laboratory where technicians determine the potency of the marijuana and label it accordingly. (Harborside says it rejects 80 percent of the marijuana that arrives at its door for insufficient quality.) There is even a bank vault where the day’s cash is stored along with reserves of premium cannabis. An armored truck picks up deposits every evening. City officials routinely audit the dispensary’s books. Surplus cash is rolled back into the center to pay for free counseling sessions and yoga for patients. “Oakland issued licenses and regulations, and Los Angeles did nothing and they are still unregulated,” Mr. DeAngelo said. “Cannabis is being distributed by inappropriate people.” But even Oakland’s regulations fall short of Mr. Trutanich’s proposal that Los Angeles ban all cash sales. “I don’t know of any collective that operates in the way that is envisioned by this ordinance,” said Mr. Duncan, of Americans for Safe Access. Christine Gasparac, a spokeswoman for State Attorney General Jerry Brown , said that after Mr. Trutanich’s comments in Los Angeles, law enforcement officials and advocates from around the state had called seeking clarity on medical marijuana laws. Mr. Brown has issued legal guidelines that allow for nonprofit sales of medical marijuana, she said. But, she added, with laws being interpreted differently, “the final answer will eventually come from the courts.”",

    "source": "Persistent Unemployment, Without Lingering Pain <eos> CÁDIZ, Spain — Beyond its pink-hued Atlantic light and the distinction of being the oldest city in Europe, this Andalusian outpost is best known for two things: its famous carnival , which wraps up Monday after two raucous weeks, and its chronic unemployment. Both were on vivid display on a rainy recent afternoon, as a group of roving musicians called “I’ll Start Monday” belted out a “chirigota,” or satiric song. A crowd cheered, drinks in hand, as the group sang of an angel on the narrator’s shoulder telling him to “grow up” and get a job; while a devil on the other said: Why bother? Go have fun. The song explains a lot about the situation here in Cádiz, in southern Spain just north of Gibraltar. Joblessness has climbed to 19 percent in Spain, the highest in the euro zone, after the collapse of a housing bubble. But here in Cádiz, it is at a staggering 29 percent — and has been in double digits for decades. Elsewhere in Europe, such high numbers would lead to deep social unrest. Not so in Cádiz. Here, as across the Mediterranean, life remains puzzlingly comfortable behind the dramatic figures, thanks to a complex safety net in which the underground economy, family support and government subsidies ensure a relatively high quality of life. “This is a place where you can live well, even when unemployed,” said Pilar Castiñeira, 30, as she attended a performance of carnival skits in a downtown theater. “Life is four days long,” she added, recounting a Spanish saying. “On one you’re born, on another you die, and in the two in between, you have to have fun.” That was certainly the case during carnival. People walked around the city’s colorful and cheerily shabby downtown, which has been used in movies as a stand-in for Havana, drinking, listening to the roving musicians dressed in outlandish costumes and eating fried fish out of paper cones. The party even continued for nearly a week after the start of Lent. Yet beyond the bar hopping, there were other realities. Over lunch in a restaurant with a view of the port, Miguel Cervera García, a grizzled 47, explained how he made ends meet. He said he had picked olives and worked as a plumber, but never officially. “I’ve always worked, but without a contract,” he said amiably. He added that jobs with contracts were better, “since you get social security and paid sick days.” Payroll taxes and unemployment benefits are high in Spain, and many people avoid them by hiring workers under the table or by offering them temporary contracts that avoid the high costs of hiring and firing. Always popular in the Mediterranean, tax fraud has grown during the economic crisis, to the point that many experts see it as the biggest reason why high unemployment has not translated into mass protests. Officials say that one-third of Cádiz Province’s 170,000 unemployed people are no longer receiving state unemployment subsidies, indicating that the underground economy and families must be taking care of the rest. Officials estimate that Spain’s underground economy equals at least 20 percent of the official economy. In Andalusia, it is believed to be higher. Families remain a strong support network. Home ownership is highly valued, and even out-of-work Spaniards often live on the cheap in homes their families paid off long ago. “If one person in the family works, he’s a net for the whole family,” said Juan Bouza, Andalusia’s point-person for employment in Cádiz. Mr. Bouza reiterated a central tenet of Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero’s approach to the crisis: extending unemployment benefits even as the state deficit is growing. “We don’t think that people will find a job more easily if we remove help,” Mr. Bouza said. “We think the weakest people need help.” To some, the cultural acceptance of unemployment is part of the problem. “For most people here being unemployed and — while it lasts — living off state benefits is perfectly natural,” said David Pantoja, 36, an out-of-work carpenter who founded an association for the unemployed in Cádiz. “It’s just a fact of life, like love or death.” Indeed, for decades Andalusia has had the highest unemployment levels in Spain. The jobless rate here was 13 percent four years ago, when levels elsewhere in Spain were at a near-historic low. But there were signs of improvement. In early 2008 local politicians made campaign promises to bring full employment to Andalusia, but with the collapse of the housing bubble that is not looking likely, and joblessness in the region is now at 26 percent. History explains some of the problems. During the 36 years of Franco’s dictatorship, Andalusia was Spain’s breadbasket. After the transition to democracy in the 1970s, it never fully developed into an industrial region. In recent decades it has lost a lot of ship-building jobs to Asia. Today, it draws 40 percent of its revenue from tourism, especially on the popular Mediterranean coast around Málaga. Cádiz is on the windier Atlantic side. In an office with a stunning ocean view, Mr. Bouza spoke of the region as a centerpiece in the government’s plan to turn Spain into a hub for renewable energy projects. “This will be the Silicon Valley of renewable energy,” he said. He added that 75 cents of every euro the region spends on unemployment is for courses to help train the workforce for its future in renewable energy. But not everyone is buying it. “They said that by 2012, Cádiz would be a bedroom community” for nearby industrial areas, said Esteban Vias Casais, 58, a retired factory worker who lives on a disability pension. But the city already is one, he added with a wink. “Here, everyone sleeps, and no one works!” Mr. Pantoja was not convinced by the courses, either. Sitting in a cafe after a children’s carnival parade wrapped up nearby, he said he had taken courses on business management and computer literacy, but that new skills were not the issue. After two years without work, “Enough training,” he said, “we want jobs.”",

    "source": "Containers Wall Off a Newark Housing Project <eos> NEWARK , Nov. 7 — Tasha Solomon opened the grimy plastic blinds of her first floor-apartment in the Millard E. Terrell Homes, a housing project hard by the Passaic River. She need not have bothered. Although the river is only 100 yards from her apartment, Ms. Solomon, a 25-year-old mother of two, cannot see it from her window. Her view is a wall of rusty shipping containers that rises more than four stories, taller than any of the 12 buildings in the rundown housing complex. “Is there a river over there?” she asked one recent afternoon. Like drugs and gangs and poverty, the containers have simply become another unavoidable fact of life here, residents say. For decades the project, operated by the Newark Housing Authority, has been flanked by storage depots where thousands of corrugated, trailer-size containers — a byproduct of the brisk commerce at the port in Newark and Elizabeth — sit stacked one atop the other in the barren cityscape. There used to be some daylight. An expanse of concrete between Ms. Solomon’s building and the murky river once served as the complex’s recreation area. Older residents recall mother-daughter kickball tournaments, dance contests, and summer evenings spent watching the lights from downtown shimmer in the distance. “This is where we used to let it all hang out,” said Valerie Hall, who moved to the project in the mid-1960s and is one of the few who remember life before the containers. “When you’d look at those lights, it was like you could go downtown, and all you had to do was stand here.” But about 15 years ago the housing authority, a troubled agency that barely avoided a takeover by the federal government in 2005, leased the gritty three-acre recreation area to a private container storage company. What once was a baseball field is now an expanse littered with shards of glass. And a patch of open space that allowed residents to look out on the river now provides a view of ripped and rusted cargo containers. Keith Kinard was appointed executive director of the housing authority 16 months ago after a federal investigation called the agency “absolutely dysfunctional” for much of its 70-year history. Initially, a spokesman for Mr. Kinard said there was no record of a lease or rent payments to allow containers to be stored on the premises, but two weeks later he said the agency had discovered an agreement in perpetuity in 1993 with the container storage company, Palmer Industries. The agreement allowed Palmer, which had stored containers on each side of the housing project, to let them spill over onto the baseball field for $650 a month, linking its properties together with rows of containers. Now Mr. Kinard says he intends to have the containers removed, although other problems must be addressed first. “I want them off my property,” he insisted. But residents are not ready to break out the barbecue grills just yet. “The city won’t do anything about them,” said Claire Johnson, 80 years old, who said the containers had been there for as long as she could remember. “They don’t care. Besides, they get a lot of money to park them there.” While the few dozen containers on agency property are only a tiny fraction of the more than 27,000 that tower over this hardscrabble section of Newark, they were enough to seal residents off from the river. Today, waist-high weeds stab upward through the concrete, and the homeless who make this neighborhood their home string clotheslines between broken container doors. One man, known by friends in the project as Florida, was found dead last month, the police said, locked inside a container in the depot alongside the homes. The death is still under investigation. High up in the stacks, a container overflowed with trash, evidence of someone’s precarious third-story dwelling. Reaching the complex requires trekking through some of the most dense and polluted industrial corridors of urban America. Every several minutes, the roar of jets taking off from nearby Newark Liberty International Airport drowns out any hope of conversation. The rancid smell of garbage — perhaps from the Newark incinerator a mile away — permeates the air at the slightest gust of wind. Just down the road is a dioxin-tainted Superfund site, where about a million gallons of Agent Orange was produced during the Vietnam War. But with a price tag of $25 million to bring the deteriorated buildings — two of which have broken heating systems — along with their mildewed hallways and 1940s-era electrical system, up to safety and sanitation standards — $8 million more than the housing agency’s maintenance budget for the entire city — containers are not high on Mr. Kinard’s list of priorities. “I’ve got homeless people squatting inside the apartments themselves,” he said. “If containers were my worst problem, this job would be a walk in the park.” Last month, Mr. Kinard said, he asked the agency’s legal department to find a way to terminate the agreement with Columbia Container Services, which took over Palmer’s storage depots in 2003. He said negotiations would begin in the coming weeks. Two directors of Columbia Container, John Armstrong and Bruce A. Fenimore, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. One tenant, a 20-year-old bank teller, who declined to give his name for fear of being associated with the project, said he gave up looking out his window years ago. “It’s an asbestos river anyway,” he said. For Mayor Cory A. Booker, the plight of Terrell Homes is yet another test in the effort to revitalize this long-struggling city. As Newark begins to explore ways to develop its waterfront for recreational and residential uses, officials have to figure out what to do with thousands of containers that land at Port Newark-Elizabeth — the third largest port in the United States — and line long swaths of the Passaic. “The city can’t come to us and ask for jobs with the port and then say it wants to take the land these businesses are located in and turn it into parks or condominiums,” said Randy Brown, a spokesman for the New York Shipping Association, which represents Newark’s three storage depots. The port and the network of trucks, warehouses, and storage lots that service it account for about 300,000 jobs, Mr. Brown said, one of the largest sources of employment in New Jersey. He said a vast majority of containers stayed in the region for only 12 days before being shipped out on barges. The abandoned ones sit in the depots until they are repurchased, increasingly for scrap metal, Mr. Brown said, although he acknowledged that the industry did not keep track of the number of derelict containers stacked along the river. But officials say the city, which recently began work on a public park along the waterfront from Newark Penn Station to the edge of the storage depots — including the Terrell Homes — is determined to find out just how many there are. Joel Sonkin, counsel to the deputy mayor for economic development, said the city had enlisted researchers from Rutgers and the New Jersey Institute of Technology to investigate the question. For now, residents of the Terrell Homes remain in their walled city. Older women chat away the afternoon, and teenage boys in bandannas cluster around the cars in the benchless complex, their voices smothered by the drone of planes. Children dare one another to scale the fence that separates them from the container-choked lot. “It looks like some kind of scrap yard or recycling plant,” said Denise Suver, 46. “This is a place for people to live, not a garbage dump.”",

    "source": "Growth of Indonesian Airlines Strains the Infrastructure <eos> JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesian airlines are poised for rapid growth, but a lack of critical infrastructure and trained personnel may keep the industry from reaching anticipated heights, experts say. The total number of fliers is expected to double within five years, record growth for a nation with a history of poor safety standards. If improvements do not keep pace with demand, “this growth, which they could take advantage of, will come to a halt,” said Shukor Yusof, an aviation analyst at the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s in Singapore. Last year, 60 million Indonesians took to the skies, a 15 percent increase from 2010, according to the Ministry of Transportation. International passenger traffic in the country grew 23 percent, to eight million. In 2001, the Ministry of Transportation loosened the rules for starting an airline, in part to help bolster the economy after the Asian financial crisis. The number of operating licenses rose sharply between then and 2004, when the ministry issued a second round of revisions. According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, part of the ministry, the new rules required only two planes for an operator to start a commercial airline, reduced limitations on the type and age of those planes and allowed airlines to deviate from their business plans, encouraging them to explore the market. At that time, “it’s possible we concentrated more on developing the market and were not so focused on safety concerns,” said Hemi Pamuraharjo, the deputy director for scheduled flight services at the Ministry of Transportation. Jakarta’s main hub, Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, was built to handle 22 million passengers. Last year, it served more than 50 million, and it is the fastest-growing airport in the world, according to the Airports Council International. In some places music stations and phone calls interfere with radio frequencies used by airports and aircraft, causing communication breakdowns with the air traffic control authorities. “They have a very old system,” said one pilot with Lion Air, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear that he would lose his job. Sometimes the air traffic control radar fails, as it did in Bali on July 15, creating delays and potentially dangerous confusion. “They know who you are, but they don’t know where you are,” the pilot said. He also said the increase in demand for air travel had created flight crew shortages. Last month he worked more than his allotted 110 airtime hours. “Now, I am working always,” he said. “Our biggest concern is with airport facilities, crew and human resources,” like air traffic controllers, Mr. Pamuraharjo said. There are now 18 airlines offering regularly scheduled flights, up from 13 in 2001. Garuda recently spun off Citilink, a low-cost subsidiary, and Lion Air is set to introduce a premium carrier, Batik Air, early next year. And the number of charter airlines has grown 33 percent in just four years. All are rapidly expanding to take advantage of a middle class that has grown rapidly in the last eight years, to 130 million from 80 million. “It’s kind of perfect for the airline market, particularly the low-cost segment,” said Brendan Sobie, a senior analyst for Southeast Asia at the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation, a consulting firm. And in a country of 17,500 islands, flying looks a lot better than the alternatives. Away from the main island of Java, road and rail networks are underdeveloped. Ferry rides often involve dangerous sea crossings on dilapidated ships. Sinkings are common. Air travel’s increasing popularity and accessibility seem to have emboldened airlines, despite infrastructure problems and overcrowding. “If my passengers complain about delays, I say, ‘Go by bus, go by train,’ ” said Rusdi Kirana, the chief executive of Lion Air, the low-cost Indonesian carrier. “We need them, and they need us.” The Malaysian airline Air Asia is rapidly expanding in Indonesia and last month agreed to buy the Indonesian low-cost carrier Batavia Air for $80 million. “Indonesia is like a planet,” said Tony Fernandes, Air Asia’s chief executive. “There is lots of room to grow.” Garuda, which went public last year but is majority-owned by the government, plans to increase its fleet to 194 aircraft from 95 by the end of 2015. It had $88 million in profits last year, even as other major carriers in the Asia-Pacific region, like Qantas of Australia and Cathay Pacific of Hong Kong, had an earnings dip. The most notable growth has come at Lion Air, the largest private Indonesian carrier. It recently signed a record $22.4 billion order for 230 Boeing 737s. Unlike many carriers in the Asia-Pacific region, Indonesian airlines have concentrated on increasing their domestic share. Garuda says it will cut back on flights to Europe this year because of high costs for fuel and sagging demand but will expand its routes to serve more remote areas in Indonesia. “For now, there’s a tremendous amount of opportunity to grow the domestic market,” said Mr. Sobie of the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation. But many airlines face staff shortages, and some have started pushing pilots to fly the maximum allowable number of hours to increase flight frequencies. The Ministry of Transportation has also come under pressure as demand has outstripped the capacity of airports and airlines. In 2007, an aircraft flown by the low-cost operator Adam Air crashed into the sea off northern Sulawesi Island, killing all 102 aboard. An investigation of the plane’s flight data recorder determined poor maintenance to have been a main cause. Months later, a Boeing 737-400 flown by Garuda overshot a runway in Central Java Province and burst into flames, killing 21 of the 140 on board. The pilot was later convicted of criminal negligence; the sentence was later overturned. Regulations were tightened in 2008 after a decision by the European Union to ban all Indonesian airlines from entering its airspace from 2007 to 2009 because of lax safety standards. The ban was lifted on only a handful of airlines, including Garuda. The Ministry of Transportation says it has made strides toward improving the safety record. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation is establishing runway safety teams to monitor airstrips for damage and obstructions. It plans to train as many as 180 new inspectors by the end of the year. “But implementation needs coordination with other ministries, and of course there is the budget limitation,” said Arfiyanti Samad, a secretary at the directorate. Much of the ministry’s budget of 6 trillion rupiah (more than $630 million) for 2012 will go toward improving airports, she said. But according to Mr. Yusof of S.& P., the country will need to invest as much as $5 billion in maintenance, repair and infrastructure before 2015, when the region’s aviation sector will come under an “open skies” agreement among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. “Indonesia as a whole has a lot to do to improve their culture of safety,” he said. Gerry Soejatman, an airline analyst at Dini Nusa Kusuma, an information technology business that provides satellite service to Indonesia, said that intensifying competition within Indonesia would push local airlines to improve their service and safety records. “There will be a drive to provide a better experience,” he said. “And new technology will provide the edge.”",

District Attorney Steve Cooley called it the most significant case of public corruption he had seen in four decades in the office. Mr. Noguez was arrested along with his chief appraiser, Mark McNeil, and an Arizona tax consultant, Ramin Salari, accused of conspiring to cut property values and save millions in taxes for clients of Mr. Salari, a campaign contributor. Mr. Cooley declined to comment on whether owners of the properties, primarily on the west side of Los Angeles, knew of the conspiracy. He said that there could be further arrests. Charges against Mr. Noguez include conspiracy, bribery and corruption. The complaint charged that he accepted $185,000 in bribes from Mr. Salari. The others were charged with conspiracy and misappropriation of public funds. A defense lawyer for Mr. Noguez said Mr. Cooley was engaged in a one-sided inquiry aimed at “getting” Mr. Noguez.",

    "source": "U.S. Intelligence Puts New Focus on Afghan Graft <eos> WASHINGTON — The military’s intelligence network in Afghanistan , designed for identifying and tracking terrorists and insurgents, is increasingly focused on uncovering corruption that is rampant across Afghanistan’s government, security forces and contractors, according to senior American officials. Military intelligence officers in Afghanistan are scouring seized documents and interrogating captured fighters and facilitators — but not just to learn about insurgent networks that plan attacks, plant roadside explosives and send out suicide bombers. They are also looking for insights on how to combat a widespread perversion of authority by Afghan power brokers, which senior officials describe as “a plague” on the American-backed effort to build an effective and competent government and win the support of the Afghan people. It is a remarkable but perilous military undertaking in a sovereign country, particularly in a place of conspiracy theories and constantly shifting alliances, where it is hard to know who can be trusted and where many people are historically skeptical of what they see as intrusiveness by outsiders, this time by the Americans. The United States and its NATO allies may find themselves following leads that point to the top levels of government, because even close family members of President Hamid Karzai have been accused of engaging in the drug trade and enriching themselves with lucrative business deals. American contractors are among those accused of wrongdoing, and some in the United States government have been known to look the other way rather than upset Mr. Karzai. The new military anti-corruption effort is a joint operation with Afghan law enforcement and judicial authorities. But on Saturday, The New York Times reported that some in Afghanistan, including one of Mr. Karzai’s former top intelligence aides, complained that the Afghan president himself was increasingly mistrustful of the United States and had talked of cutting his own agreement with the Taliban. A central goal in the Obama administration’s counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan, which is commanded by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, is to win over the country’s population. That goal requires persuading the Afghan people to support the central government in Kabul and not shadow Taliban governments that exist in many provinces. To that end, anti-corruption efforts are every bit as important as killing or capturing militants, if not more so, according to senior officers involved in the effort. “Where once our whole network was to capture and kill Al Qaeda and the Taliban, now the information we’re trying to get is the information for the networks of corruption and government and influence,” said a senior American military officer in Afghanistan. “The intelligence we were focused on before was just to drive the next target we were going to get,” he said. “Now our targeting is much more focused on the government: How do you control for corruption? How does the process work for security contracts?” Top NATO officials in Afghanistan drove the creation of a new anti-corruption task force last October, and it has already succeeded in forcing out a number of provincial security officials suspected of significant wrongdoing, many of whom have been brought to trial. The task force, whose senior NATO leader is Maj. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the alliance’s director of military intelligence in Afghanistan, gathered information that allowed Afghan officials to arrest, try and convict a border police commander who was pocketing salaries from ghost personnel on his payroll as well as stealing money meant for widows of officers killed in action. Other provincial-level police chiefs have been removed from their posts because they were involved in corrupt activities uncovered by the task force’s intelligence operations, although they were not brought to trial because of a lack of the kind of evidence that could be presented in Afghan courts, officials said. These actions, while still limited in scope, have served as “a shot across the bow” of the security ministries, said another senior American military officer. “The word is out that we are going to continue to look at corrupt behavior in the police and that we have an effort under way,” the officer said. “In a counterinsurgency fight, we cannot afford to have abusive behavior by police, and we cannot afford to have corrupt behavior by police.” That officer, like other the others who discussed the effort, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of military intelligence operations. The military is focused on battling corruption at the local and provincial levels in ways that illustrate a commitment to good governance for the population to see in their day-to-day lives. Yet, Pentagon officials acknowledge that this localized effort must be supported by a more senior-level, political decision by the Obama administration on how to deal with corruption at the uppermost echelons of the Afghan government. American military officials have worked closely with Afghan law enforcement authorities and developed information that local prosecutors have used in newly established trials at the detention center for detainees accused of corruption or drug charges. Ultimately, this kind of information could also be used to help the Afghan government weed out corrupt governors. American officers are cognizant that some Afghans may make false accusations to use the anti-corruption effort to take down political opponents. The antidote for such abuse, officials say, is to demand multiple sources of information, with multiple sources of confirmation, before making taking action. “It’s a lesson we learned from Iraq — to ‘mass’ intelligence against one individual,” said the senior American officer. “We mass the analysts, we mass the interrogators and we mass the exploiters of the information before making a move.” Weeding out corruption is not the only significant adjustment of military intelligence activities in Afghanistan as the Defense Department shifts the bulk of its attention from Iraq. In Iraq, a relatively well-educated and high-tech society with a similarly well-organized insurgency, American troops seized computer hard drives and cellphones that provided a trove of information about militant networks, including detailed accounting of foreign fighters flowing into the country. In Afghanistan, by contrast, there is a much lower level of technical sophistication with far fewer computers, hard drives and other communications equipment to exploit. In addition, insurgent networks in Afghanistan are far more fractured and decentralized than in Iraq. More than 90 percent of detainees from recent security sweeps in Afghanistan are from their local areas, and are not foreign fighters or insurgents from other districts within Afghanistan. Thus, they have little information about the broader insurgent network that can be exploited. Interrogations of these recent detainees yield a “good news, bad news” version of events, officials said. According to senior American officers, many detainees expressed deep frustration at the Taliban leadership in exile inside Pakistan. These detainees — even the group aged 35 to 55 and who are in leadership ranks of the provincial insurgency — tell interrogators that they are short of money and tired of taking orders from leaders who remain at a safe distance from the fight. At the same time, these detainees still express a lack of confidence in the Kabul government, and remain unwilling to reintegrate and stop fighting, officials said. The troop increase ordered to Afghanistan by President Obama has brought with it increases in the intelligence-gathering and exploitation effort, as well. The American military operation in Afghanistan is operating with significantly increased numbers of sophisticated surveillance aircraft and a growing number of analysts to exploit the widening stream of information. The number of American military and civilian interrogators has doubled since last summer, to about 75 people, a senior military officer said. And “fusion cells” — teams of people who gather and assess information from the battlefield to quickly pinpoint a likely target for a follow-on raid — have been pushed from the large headquarters in Kabul out to military outposts across the country.",
