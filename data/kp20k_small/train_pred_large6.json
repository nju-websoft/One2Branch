    "source": "a modified offset roll printing for thin film transistor applications . <eos> in order to realize a high resolution and high throughput printing method for thin film transistor application , a modified offset roll printing was studied . this roll printing chiefly consists of a blanket with low surface energy and a printing plate ( clich ) with high surface energy . in this study , a finite element analysis was done to predict the blanket deformation and to find the optimal angle of clichs sidewall . various etching methods were investigated to obtain a high resolution clich and the surface energy of the blanket and clich was analyzed for ink transfer . a high resolution clich with the sidewall angle of <digit> and the intaglio depth of <digit> m was fabricated by the deep reactive ion etching method . based on the surface energy analysis , we extracted the most favorable condition to transfer inks from a blanket to a clich , and thus thin films were deposited on a si clich to increase the surface energy . through controlling roll speed and pressure , two inks , etch resist and silver paste , were printed on a rigid substrate , and the fine patterns of <digit> m width and <digit> m line spacing were achieved . by using this printing process , the top gate amorphous indiumgalliumzinc oxide tfts with channel width length of <digit> <digit> m were successfully fabricated by printing etch resists .",
